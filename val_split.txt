Important announcement regarding Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne Korea National Qualifier

Dear Players

This is the WCG committee.

Currently, WCG is running more than 300 online tournaments in over 80 countries as part of the WCG 2019 Xi'an Game Sports competition.

To run a fair contest, we announced the rules for each event in advance through the WCG official homepage and tournament page earlier in March, and these were agreed by all players.

While running the WCG 2019 event, we're striving to actively reflect the opinions of the players.It was stated in the rules that all competitions should be played on the designated servers, this includes the Warcraft III: Frozen Throne tournament.

However, the 1st match (LawLiet vs Lucifer) of the semi-finals of the WCG 2019 Xi'an Warcraft III Korea National Qualifiers was found to be played on a non-designated server.

In principle, the two players should be disqualified, but considering the purpose of the WCG is about ‘participation of everyone’, there was a lack of malice from the players, and we considered the opinions of many users,

the WCG committee decided to re-run the match on the designated Battle.net server.

The WCG committee requests that all players make an effort to be aware of the regulations so that such a situation does not occur again, and WCG will do our best to ensure that all players can play in a more comfortable environment to make this a great experience for all involved.

Sincerely,
The sum of his statements puts Buttigieg somewhere in the middle of the spectrum of Democratic candidates, between Sanders and Warren on the left and Joe Biden (still unannounced) in the center. But without details, it’s impossible to place him precisely — and he appears to like it that way.
Anderson .Paak & the Free Nationals performed last night at Coachella 2019’s second weekend, and he brought out some notable guests. .Paak enlisted R&B icon Brandy for “Jet Black,” a track from his recent LP Ventura. Later in the set, Jay Rock jumped onstage for a rendition of “King’s Dead”—the Black Panther cut originally performed by Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Future, James Blake, and Mike Will Made-It. Jay also performed his Redemption track “Win.”

.Paak played tracks from the new album, as well as songs from Malibu and Oxnard. Like last weekend’s set, he briefly paid tribute to Nipsey Hussle and the late Mac Miller. .Paak also played “Dang!,” his collaborative track with Miller.

Ventura is .Paak’s follow-up LP to his 2018 LP Oxnard. Earlier this month, he dropped “Make It Better”—a collaborative track with Motown legend Smokey Robinson.

Noam Chomsky, the noted progressive scholar, believes Democrats have focused far too much on Russia. And he thinks it might earn them four more years of President Donald Trump.

Speaking at a forum in Boston with Amy Goodman, Chomsky stated his view that he always believed there was going to be little to no proof of collusion in the Mueller Report.

“[T]he Democrats are helping him,” Chomsky said. “They are. Take the focus on Russia-gate. What’s that all about? I mean, it was pretty obvious at the beginning that you’re not going to find anything very serious about Russian interference in elections.”

He added, “As far as Trump collusion with the Russians, that was never going to amount to anything more than minor corruption, maybe building a Trump hotel in Red Square or something like that, but nothing of any significance.”

Chomsky went on to say that he believes focusing too heavily on Russia may cost Democrats dearly next November.

“The Democrats invested everything in this issue,” Chomsky said. “Well, turned out there was nothing much there. They gave Trump a huge gift. In fact, they may have handed him the next election. … That’s a matter of being so unwilling to deal with fundamental issues, that they’re looking for something on the side that will somehow give political success.”

Press secretary defended past statements she made in an interview on Friday that Mueller’s team said had ‘no basis in fact’

Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has defended claims she repeatedly made to reporters in 2017 regarding Donald Trump’s firing of then FBI director James Comey – despite admitting to investigators for the special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no basis in fact.

Sanders admitted in statements to the special counsel that her repeated claims that the president fired Comey because the rank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in him as FBI director were “a slip of the tongue” and “not founded on anything”, according to the redacted version of the Mueller report released on Thursday.

Mueller report: press secretary Sarah Sanders admitted to lying to reporters Read more

The long-awaited report – the product of a two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and the Trump campaign – exposed a culture of lying at the White House.

The report included multiple examples of Trump’s current and former press secretaries making false claims to journalists, particularly in the days after Comey’s firing.

Sanders told the special counsel’s office that a statement she made to journalists about how the White House had heard from “countless members” of the FBI that Comey lacked support within the agency, “was not founded on anything”.

Yet on Friday, Sanders appeared on ABC’s Good Morning America and appeared to stand by the statement she had admitted was a lie.

Asked by TV host George Stephanopoulos about her “deliberate false statement” she said: “They [FBI rank-and-file] continued to speak out and said that James Comey was a disgrace, a leaker. I stand by the fact, George.”

Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under Bill Clinton, interrupted, saying: “[You admitted] those comments weren’t founded on anything, when you faced criminal penalty.”

ABC News (@ABC) On @GMA, White House press sec. Sarah Sanders sought to double down on past statements she made that special counsel Robert Mueller's team said were "not founded on anything."

Sanders answered: “It was the heat of the moment, meaning that it wasn’t a scripted talking point. I’m sorry that I wasn’t a robot like the Democratic party.”

Sanders’ claim on 10 May 2017, the day after Comey was fired, that “countless members of the FBI” opposed Comey was “a slip of the tongue”, Sanders told the special counsel’s office in an interview last year.

Sanders repeated that “slip of the tongue” during a press briefing the following day, when skeptical White House reporters questioned her on her claim that Comey did not have support within the FBI’s rank-and-file. One reporter asked what basis the White House had for that conclusion, given that the FBI’s acting director had publicly said that Comey still had the support among the FBI’s agents.

“I can speak to my own personal experience,” Sanders told the White House press. “I’ve heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president’s decision.” She went on: “I’ve certainly heard from a large number of individuals. And that’s just myself. And I don’t know that many people in the FBI.”

“You personally have talked to countless officials, employees, since this happened?” another reporter asked later.

“Correct,” Sanders said.

“I mean, really?” the second reporter asked.

“Between, like, email, text messages – absolutely,” Sanders said.

“Fifty? Sixty? Seventy?” the reporter asked.

“Look, we’re not going to get into a numbers game. I have heard from a large number of individuals that work at the FBI that said they’re very happy with the president’s decision. I don’t know what else I can say.”

The key unanswered questions from the Mueller report Read more

A year later, in interviews with the special counsel’s office, Sanders said “that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made ‘in the heat of the moment’ that was not founded on anything”.

Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary at the time, also made a false claim to reporters about Comey’s firing, telling journalists the night Comey was fired that the decision to fire him “was all” Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.

Rosenstein said in an interview with the special counsel’s office that he had told other justice department officials that night that he would not participate in putting out a “false story” that Comey’s firing had been his idea.

Sanders replaced Spicer as White House press secretary in July 2017.

The White House’s public press briefings to journalists have become increasingly rare and increasingly brief, another issue of concern for the American press and White House transparency.
BRETT BROWN WAS 25 and lost. It's not an unfamiliar place for many.

He was single and stir-crazy, unfulfilled in a sales job, a few years out of Boston University -- where he played for Rick Pitino -- and with an itch to see more. He had made some sound investments and worked all hours for too long. He was the son of two schoolteachers and he had already made what he considered "a significant amount of money."

Something was missing.

"A purpose-driven life? I didn't feel that at all," the Philadelphia 76ers head coach said at his desk before the playoffs.

He had the means ... and an epiphany.

"The reality that I just didn't want to do this," he said. Searching for something more, something different, he ended up in Australia.

But it was a fateful phone call that kept him there. Kept him there for almost two decades, through a rise up the Australian basketball coaching ranks that paralleled the sport's rise in the vast country. Kept him there until the NBA beckoned and now to the NBA Playoffs and the Sixers' current series with the Brooklyn Nets.

Land of make and believe

BEFORE THE CALL, there were close calls.

He left for the South Pacific in 1985 with a one-way ticket and no plans. His family was back home in Maine, where his father, Bob, was in the midst of a high school and college coaching career that would land him in the state's sports hall of fame. He knew a coaching job was always there if he wanted it. He had already served as a graduate assistant for a season at his alma mater.

That could wait.

He went abalone hunting off Bondi Beach, "with just a snorkel and a big knife. You just peel them off, put them in the mesh net, pan-fry them in some olive oil -- delicious."

He met new people. One new buddy invited Brown to his family farm. Part of the planned breakfast was an emu-egg omelet, so they woke up early and hopped on a dirt bike to go egg hunting. They spotted an emu nest -- jagged sticks everywhere -- and Brown grabbed two of the eggs and went to get back on the bike, and he noticed his friend's eyes bulge.

"He's like, 'We gotta go!' and I look back and I could see this emu coming from probably 30 yards away, and, I mean, they move. I had this decision -- do I let go of these eggs?" Brown held onto those emu eggs like his breakfast depended on it.

"We just booked it, and we ended up losing the emu. Good breakfast," he said.

And then he was traveling on Great Keppel Island on the Great Barrier Reef with just a backpack and a tent, and he met a girl. Anna was pretty, fun, and, he says, "I could have a laugh with her, have a beer with her. It was just good fun."

They parted company then, but kept in touch. She went back to Victoria, and he to Bondi Beach, where he was a volunteer coach for the Sydney University basketball team. Brown got his his coaching start in New Zealand with Altos Auckland after getting a ringing endorsement from his former college coach. After Sydney's appearance in the Intervarsity tournament -- then Australia's version of the NCAA's March Madness -- he planned on going from Melbourne to Sydney and back home to the United States, perhaps to coach with his father.

But he felt for Anna. So he made the fateful call.

"She said, 'I have a holiday, meet me in Melbourne, I'll drive you to the family farm in McArthur' -- and it's green, it's rugged ocean, I mean, it's Ireland -- and I did," he said. "I stayed. I changed my Qantas flight, stayed there two or three weeks, got deeply connected with her and stayed. Had she not picked up, I would've gotten on the train 15 minutes later and I would've flown home, written a few letters. Who knows what would've happened?"

They stayed for 17 more years. He married Anna, had two daughters with her -- later, a son -- and slowly, and then suddenly, ascended the Australian basketball coaching ranks.

Paralleled success

EARLIER THIS SEASON, a day after a 23-point home victory over the Los Angeles Lakers and a day before a crushing loss to Eastern Conference-rival Boston, Brown was still trying to get a feel for his 76ers team. Just three months after pulling off a stunning trade for Minnesota Timberwolves star Jimmy Butler, his team had acquired former LA Clippers forward Tobias Harris, adding yet another 20-point scorer to a potent starting lineup which includes Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and JJ Redick. Addressing a horde of reporters after practice, Brown joked that it felt like he was coaching his third team this season.

An hour later, relaxing in his office after the long session, he laughed again as he recalled his humble coaching origins in Australia. The sand all over the locker room floor, the surfboards tied to half of his players' cars, "Practice would end and BAM! -- they'd hit the beach," he said.

"There was this streetball, hip-hop, urban feel that the Australian youth was very much attracted to. ... It was almost like now there was another area the youth could be attracted to that wasn't just Billabong." Brett Brown on the rise of basketball in Australia in the 1980's

In 1988, Brown was hired by Australian coaching legend Lindsay Gaze as an unpaid assistant for the Melbourne Tigers, also working in the marketing department. In five years, he was named the head coach of the North Melbourne Giants, guiding the Giants to a National Basketball League title a year later.

When Brown began his coaching career in Australia, the sport had started to attract players and attention. American college players were finding a home Down Under, and staying for years.

"There was this streetball, hip-hop, urban feel that the Australian youth was very much attracted to," Brown recalled. "Hat on backwards, skateboards, hip-hop. It was kind of cool to play. The country was such a surfing nation, it was almost like now there was another area the youth could be attracted to that wasn't just Billabong."

Brown saw as the country dedicated more and more resources toward the sport, with the thriving Australian Institute of Sport youth program and an increasing number of Australians making it to the NBA.

Melbourne-born Luc Longley's debut for the Chicago Bulls in 1992 marked the first Aussie to play in the league in nearly two decades, and he was the first Australian-born first-round pick.

Longley begat Chris Anstey, who played three years in the league from 1997 to 2000, and he begat Andrew Bogut, who rose from relative obscurity to become the No. 1 pick in the 2005 NBA draft. Since Bogut's debut, a dozen native Australians or New Zealanders have made it to the NBA.

And not just made it.

Both the 2011 No. 1 pick -- Kyrie Irving -- and the 2016 No. 1 pick, Simmons, were born in Australia, and both to American-born former college players who eventually played for Brown. Three first overall picks in a dozen years, and Brown had a connection to all three, having coached Irving's father, Drederick -- also a Boston U. graduate -- and Simmons' father, David, in Australia.

"[Drederick] was my starting point guard and during that season, his son Kyrie was born," Brown said. "And David [Simmons], I was an assistant coach with Lindsay Gaze, and I had five years or six years coaching David. I knew Ben's mom before they were even married. She was actually a cheerleader for the Melbourne Tigers. Those guys, with Joe Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Aron Baynes -- this is gonna be Australia's most potent team they ever had."

As a former Australian Olympic team head coach, Brown had a hand in that.

An assistant coach for the team between 1995 and 2003, with a visit to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the 2000 Sydney Games, Brown was hired as the head coach in 2009. Brown oversaw a Boomers squad that finished 10th in the 2010 FIBA World Championships and went to the quarterfinals of the 2012 London Olympics before losing to the eventual gold medal-winning United States.

"That connection to the land and the country, we saw it come out of him as coach," said Canberra-born Spurs guard Patty Mills, who played for Brown in London in 2012. "He took the reins of the whole federation. It meant something to him. You saw it in every game, every practice, every interview. That's the type of leader we needed."

Dellavedova, one of 10 current Aussies playing in the NBA, first played for Brown in 2009, when he was 18. Brown cut him twice in 2010, but kept him with the senior national team in 2011 and in 2012 at the Olympics.

"He was massive for my development, and he gave me a good road map of what it would take to make it in the NBA and be successful here," Dellavedova said. "He was great in building a strong base for the national team that we're building off today. His passion for Australia and Australian basketball -- you can feel it when you talk to him. He's excited to see he left it in a better place than when he found it."

Brown recalls his time with the national team fondly, from helping to institute a national depth chart through the youth ranks to leading to the Olympics the best group of "10 bartenders" he's ever seen. "They fought, man," he said, breaking into a grin. "They fought. Holy s---, did they fight."

Dellavedova attributed the fight to the fact that so many eventual Australian basketball players trace their roots back to either Australian rules football in the south of the country or rugby in the north.

"We're not scared of contact," he said, "we've been hit before. We know how to deal with a bump. Part of Australian attitude and mindset is you never back down and you always have your mate's back. On our national emblem, there's a kangaroo and an emu -- and those are two animals that can't take a backwards step."

Life coach, not coach for life

BROWN'S CAREER HAS has been one big forward step since his time in Australia.

Spurs general manager R.C. Buford met Brown at an Adidas camp in Australia, and a year later, after Brown's Australian team merged with another -- leaving Brown paid, but jobless -- Buford brought him to San Antonio as an unpaid basketball-operations staff member. That year, 1999, the Spurs won their first NBA championship in a strike-shortened season.

"You could tell then, he clearly knew the game, and he clearly knew Australian basketball," Buford said.

After returning to coach the Sydney Kings from 2000 to 2002, Brown rejoined the Spurs in 2002 as director of player development and was eventually promoted to assistant coach, and he'd help guide the team to titles in 2003, 2005 and 2007 before being hired by the 76ers in 2013.

"It was awesome, mate, not only having the chance to play for him Australia, but in San Antonio as well," Mills said. "He's the main reason I'm still here in San Antonio."

But from San Antonio to Philadelphia, a part of Brown indeed remains in the Outback.

His office is filled with relics from his past life, from the Australian rules football over his shoulder to the pictures of his wife and kids in front of another pristine beach. A room in his home is dedicated to indigenous art.

He even brings a bit of Australia with him to Sixers practice.

"You hear him say 'mate' a good bit," 76ers point guard T.J. McConnell said. "I think it's just natural for him."

He visits with his family every summer, and the routine is the same. Lands in Melbourne and heads four hours straight to Port Fairy. Brown says there are a few good restaurants, a grocery store, a bar, a deli and a gym where he gets shots up with his son. And he fishes -- lots of fishing.

Every time Brown visits, he learns something new. He describes himself as having "a world-class curiosity," and "maybe it's in my DNA to not be afraid of much."

One day, and it could be sooner than one might think, he'll be back on one of those beaches. This time, for good.

"I'm gonna be 58 quite soon, and I've been able to do a lot in our sport that I'm proud of," he said.

"If I wasn't doing this, the chances of me being somewhere on the ocean -- or on a lake fishing -- are strong. I tell my team all the time, 'Ooh, you will never see me again.' I'll send you an email and give you a fist bump, but there's a hermit in me for sure."

WASHINGTON—In their second summit at the White House, President Trump met Egypt’s military dictator, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, on April 9, praising him for being a “great president who has been doing a fantastic job.” Meanwhile, earlier that day, members of the U.S. Congress, human rights organizations, and activists at a hearing condemned el-Sissi’s human rights record.

Egyptian actor and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Khaled Abol Naga joined the group. In his testimony, Abol Naga criticized the miserable human rights situation in Egypt under the military coup led by el-Sissi.

Abol Naga, who was born in Cairo in 1975, received an engineering degree from Ain Shams University in that city. He also studied theater and drama at the American University in Cairo and later pursued studies acting, cinematography, and directing in the United States. Abol Naga, who started his professional acting career in 2000, is recognized for his work across Egypt. He has been appointed to the juries of numerous local and international film festivals since 2008 and has also acted in several English-speaking roles and participated in many European festivals, where he received various awards.

Abol Naga has used his status to promote awareness regarding democracy, religious tolerance, children’s rights, and adolescents’ development, particularly in the Middle East. In 2007, he was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.

In January 2011, Abol Naga supported millions of Egyptians who protested in Tahrir Square demanding bread, freedom, social justice, and human dignity. While former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime was using public figures to undermine and defame that revolution, Abol Naga was one of a few celebrities who joined the protesters. He participated in the mass demonstrations that led to the removal of Mubarak.

Resisting potential religious fascism, Abol Naga participated in the demonstrations of June 30, 2013, that were subsequently used by the military to provide cover for its coup against the first elected president, Mohamed Morsi. Like many other people, Abol Naga saw that a repressive military dictatorship in Egypt was not what opponents of right-wing religious fundamentalism were fighting for on June 30. The military, led by el-Sissi, was just using the protests to give legitimacy to their coup.

Because of the increasingly miserable situation in Egypt since 2013, Abol Naga has been advocating for Egyptians seeking freedom and democracy. He criticizes el-Sissi and his regime for human rights violations and proposed constitution amendments that could potentially keep el-Sissi in office until 2034. It’s “a very long time of dictatorship that is planned,” according to Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was at the hearing in Washington on April 9.

Abol Naga said he was not speaking only on behalf of Egyptians, but of all humanity. “I should be the voice of those who have no voice, and I hope you all agree with that,” he said. He said he was willing to face consequences up to and including the ones faced by Washington Post journalist Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi, who was murdered by the corrupt Saudi regime with the full knowledge of the Trump administration.

“This can risk my life, but it is nothing compared to those who are dying right now, those who are tortured right now, those teenagers having death sentences without proper trials right now, thousands of those kids, youth, and even others. I am here on behalf of all of those who have been forcibly disappeared, incarcerated for a blog or a tweet,” he said. “We have a situation in Egypt that needs your attention. Actually, not only you, the European Union, United Nations, and every peace-loving human being on this planet.”

As a result of his advocacy for human rights in Egypt, Abol Naga has faced defamation campaigns by the Egyptian state-owned media. He was expelled from the actors’ union and accused of betraying the country. Moreover, the government has filed suit to take away his status as a citizen of Egypt.

The campaign for human rights in Egypt has a tough road to travel. The strong support for el-Sissi by the Trump administration and some other Western governments is making the battle that much tougher. Abol Naga and others involved in the fight, however, seem determined to continue until they win.

New numbers out from the U.S. Census Bureau show more than two thirds of Iowa's counties are losing population.

Among the counties in the TV9 viewing area that are losing population is Benton County.

Janice Boudonck, the owner of of the Pearl Street Social Club in Shellsburg says she thinks despite what the new figures show, it is a great time to invest in Benton County. Boundock purchased the local hot spot six years ago.

"Our business has increased," said Boudonck.

The population in 69 Iowa counties has gone down since 2010.

In many larger counties are actually getting larger. In Linn County the population is up almost seven percent and in Johnson their residents are up more than 15.5 percent.

Brian Vogt says it is far too early to write off places like Benton County. Last year Vogt purchased the old Shellsburg Bank, a property that is falling apart It is Vogt's plan to renovate the building and bring customers back in once again but next time as pizza shop.

Vogt thinks there will be others who follow in his and Janice's footsteps.

When that happens he is confident population numbers will tell a different story.

"It's like field of dreams, build it and they will come," said Vogt.
PALO ALTO — Authorities are searching for a woman who caused a national uproar — and received death threats — earlier this month after she publicly lambasted a 74-year-old man for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap at a Palo Alto coffee shop.

Rebecca Parker Mankey was reported missing Friday morning when she didn’t return to her home in Palo Alto after visiting a friend in Lake County, said Sgt. Aaron Clark of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.

Clark said investigators believe Mankey went off the grid to avoid the avalanche of negative attention she has received.

“We have nothing that makes us think she’s at-risk,” Clark said in a phone interview late Friday night. “We’ve determined from the people we’ve talked to that she is voluntarily missing.”

Two separate cellphone pings performed by law enforcement placed Mankey in the Aberdeen area of Washington state on Friday, authorities said.

Sgt. Darrin King of the Aberdeen Police Department said all the department’s officers are aware of what Mankey looks like, and have been asked to keep an eye out for her.

“Sometimes people just don’t want to be found,” King said Sunday. “Not that they’re going to do anything wrong, they just don’t want to be contacted.”

King said if officers locate her, they would use caution, ensure Mankey is safe, and not being taken anywhere against her will.

On April 1, Mankey berated the man at a California Avenue Starbucks for wearing a red MAGA cap made famous by President Donald Trump, then posted about the encounter on her Facebook page.

“He will never forget me and will think seriously about wearing that hat in my town ever again,” she wrote.

The post sparked a social media firestorm and national debate about whether Mankey’s actions reflect the country’s political divide or represent out-of-bounds extremism.

Mankey received death threats and was forced to resign from her job at Gryphon Stringed Instruments, a company that sells, rents and repairs used and vintage musical instruments. She also stepped down as a co-chair, officer and member of the Bayshore Progressive Democrats.

“Parker felt strongly that she wanted to use her privilege as a white woman to stand up for those who are living in fear because of the hateful atmosphere fostered by Trump,” the club wrote on its Facebook page.

“Unfortunately the manner in which she chose to stand up against a slogan that stands for racism led to an even stronger hateful response that has endangered her and her family.”

Anyone with information about her whereabouts can call Sgt. John Gregore of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office at 707-263-2690.

A high-profile NASA temperature data set, which has pronounced the last five years the hottest on record and the globe a full degree Celsius warmer than in the late 1800s, has found new backing from independent satellite records — suggesting the findings are on a sound footing, scientists reported Tuesday.

If anything, the researchers found, the pace of climate change could be somewhat more severe than previously acknowledged, at least in the fastest warming part of the world — its highest latitudes.

“We may actually have been underestimating how much warmer [the Arctic’s] been getting,” said Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which keeps the temperature data, and who was a co-author of the new study released in Environmental Research Letters.

[In blow to climate, coal plants emitted more than ever in 2018]

NASA’s flagship data set, known as GISTEMP, is one of two kept by agencies of the U.S. government, the other being maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Both data sets — along with several others maintained by institutions and academic groups around the world — are based on a merger of the records of thousands of thermometers spread across Earth’s land surfaces, and a growing volume of ocean measurements from buoys and other instruments.

As the data sets have shown not only steady global warming also but a string of new temperature records, they have come under increased scrutiny, with occasional criticism of the high-profile findings and how they are stitched together. However, the research groups have maintained that their methods are valid and that the different records agree considerably more than they disagree, suggesting that the warming trend they are showing is, more or less, correct.

Enter NASA’s Aqua satellite, which has been in orbit since 2002, and carries an infrared device that is able to independently measure temperatures at the surface of Earth and, in fact, do so with a higher degree of resolution than characterizes the NASA climate data set.

The temperature record provided by the satellite, which runs from 2003 through 2018 at present, supports NASA’s finding that 2016 was the hottest year on record and, generally, that the warming trend continues just as the surface thermometers have claimed, finds the study led by NASA’s Joel Susskind.

[Hurricanes are strengthening faster in the Atlantic, and climate change is a big reason why, scientists say]

“What you end up with is a really impressive correspondence between the trends that you’re seeing in this satellite product, which is totally independent of the surface temperatures, and the interpretations of the weather stations,” said Schmidt, one of Susskind’s three co-authors.

Here is a figure from the study showing how closely NASA’s data set from the years 2003 through 2017 matches the findings of the Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder on the Aqua satellite, or AIRS — and how those in turn track three other global temperature data sets:



Global mean anomalies for the AIRS and GISTEMP data sets for January 2003 through December 2017, along with three other selected data sets. (Susskind et al., Environmental Research Letters, 2019)

Notably, AIRS sometimes shows more warming than the NASA data set, and especially does so in the Arctic, a region where measurements are scarce and warming is fastest. Shockingly, it even finds that over the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic, the warming trend is at a rate of 2.5 degrees Celsius — or 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit — per decade.

This suggests that, if anything, Earth as a whole may be warming faster than NASA has until now claimed — not more slowly.

“These findings should help put to rest any lingering concerns that modern warming is somehow due to the location of sensors in urban heat islands or other measurement errors at the surface,” said Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley who works on another of the temperature data sets — called Berkeley Earth — and commented on the new study, with which he was not involved.

“The AIRS satellite data captures the whole surface of the planet and shows that, if anything, our surface measurements are slightly underestimating the rate of modern warming,” he said.

The study also reinforces "that the Arctic is warming much faster than the rest of the world, and that correctly estimating temperatures in the region is important to understanding what is happening to the world as a whole,” Hausfather said.

The new research “confirms (yet again) from an independent source that the surface temperature records over the past couple of decades are robust,” added Ed Hawkins, a climate researcher at the University of Reading in Britain, by email.

The methodologies used to calculate Earth’s temperature are being improved all the time — and the data sets are constantly updated with the most recent information. Lively debates will persist about how to deal with some of the problems involved in this process, such as that cities tend to be warmer than the countryside, and that records are far more numerous and reliable today than they were at the close of the 19th century or a little bit before it, when the data sets begin.

But the new study suggests none of this weakens the major conclusion: Warming is ongoing; and Earth keeps pushing record temperature highs, at least in the context of the past 140 years or so.

“For all the issues that there are, the patterns are not just qualitatively right, they’re pretty much quantitatively right, too,” Schmidt said.
Imagine someone gets caught cheating at a poker game. What’s next? After the accusations and denials, the cheater usually suffers some form of harm – confiscated winnings, ridicule, maybe ostracism. Perhaps justifiably so: most people think that cheaters deserve punishment.

This is a familiar sentiment. Humans are quick to recognise wrongdoing and to mete out penalties in response. Sometimes, we seem to enjoy the act of retribution. Punishment takes diverse and complex forms, ranging from mocking laughter to imprisonment. Sometimes, the affronted party does the punishing; other times it’s a third party.

Yet it’s also costly to give someone their just deserts. When an adult confiscates a child’s toy for bad behaviour, both are in for a rough afternoon. Which raises the question: why do we punish in the first place?

One answer is that punishment evolved to promote the greater good and prevent tragedies of the commons. This is the altruistic approach. Yes, punishment might be costly for the punisher, but (so the theory goes) it generates downstream benefits for others – stabilising cooperation, enforcing just rules, deterring freeriders. Punishment is probably essential for maintaining and enforcing norms, laws and customs. Yet its origins appear to trace back to a time before robust human societies, perhaps even before we had language to articulate the rules. Recent research has identified contexts where dominant chimps seem to punish freeloaders. So perhaps punishment preceded the benefits it generates.

After all, punishment doesn’t always promote the greater good. It’s been used to oppress minorities, foster discrimination, exploit disadvantaged groups, maintain sexist and racist social norms, and keep subjugated populations in line. In experimental setups, ‘antisocial punishment’ has been observed, in which cooperative individuals are punished by others because they contributed to a public good. Punishment can be detrimental, even in the long run.

These observations suggest that altruism is, at best, only a small part of the story. Moreover, even if punishment is crucial for achieving some forms of social cooperation, it might not have originated for that reason. Instead, perhaps it came about for another reason entirely, and only later assumed a socially beneficial role.

So, if not for the greater good, just how did punishment evolve?

One intriguing possibility can be found in early research on the evolution of social behaviour. The British evolutionary biologist William Hamilton, in his seminal theoretical work of the 1960s, categorised different social actions based on their consequences for creatures’ adaptive fitness. Altruism, according to him, is behaviour that imposes a cost on the actor and confers a benefit on a recipient. Punishment just doesn’t fit, in part due to the diffusive nature of the benefit that it’s supposed to generate. It fits more readily into another category Hamilton identified: spite. Spiteful behaviour imposes a cost on the actor and inflicts harm on the recipient.

Could punishment have originated as a kind of spite, rather than as a scaffold for social harmony? Spite evolves in situations where organisms pay an absolute cost to generate a relative advantage; having one fewer offspring can be evolutionarily advantageous if it means that others have even fewer. Spiteful actions appear at many levels of biological organisation, ranging from fish, to macaques and, of course, to humans. From an evolutionary perspective, spite is about levelling the playing field by taking everyone down, in order to get a leg up for oneself.

Once we see the potential connections between spite and punishment, we open a window onto a range of new evolutionary hypotheses about punishment’s origins. Causing harm, based on group membership or some shared trait, might have evolved first, without a clear, tangible benefit. Once established, this sort of behaviour could then be coopted to enforce cooperation – or anything else for that matter, including bad or oppressive norms. Indeed, decoupling penalties from cooperation helps to make sense of such antisocial structures: if punishment evolved as a form of directed harm, there’s no obvious reason to suppose it would necessarily be aimed only at cheaters.

When we survey nonhuman social behaviour, we see peculiar instances of what looks like punishment. Consider Pseudomonas aeruginosa: these fascinating bacteria display a form of spite by producing costly and harmful toxins. Moreover, researchers have shown that spite in populations of P aeruginosa is tied to the prevalence of ‘cheats’ that fail to produce beneficial siderophores (iron-carrying compounds), thereby incentivising cooperation. There are numerous other examples. Honey bees police egg-laying. Imported red fire ants use pheromone markers to find and kill individuals that are genetically distinct. These examples suggest that there could be a wide range of punishment-like behaviours geared towards inflicting harm.

A significant amount of current empirical and theoretical work focuses on the role of punishment in scenarios concerning public, shared goods. While this work is important, especially for thinking about humans, these studies suffer from a kind of myopia.

Consider a different well-studied scenario: the ultimatum game. In this setup, two players must decide how to divide a resource. One gets to propose a split, the other can accept the offer or reject it. If the offer is accepted, each gets his share specified by the proposal. If the offer is rejected, both parties receive nothing. The economically rational solution to this game is to offer as little as possible, and accept any offers that are made. When humans play this game, however, they frequently make offers that are more equitable and often reject those that are unfair. Such rejections are often interpreted as punishment aimed at enforcing fairness.

Yet fair behaviour in the ultimatum game doesn’t generate any net benefits over exploitative strategies. On average, the economically rational and unfair solution does just as well as the fair one. Perhaps fairness (and its enforcement) is not about making everyone better off, but about making sure the other guy doesn’t get more than you. That makes it hard to see rejections as a form of altruism. Rather, they look like costly behaviour that decreases the payoff for everyone involved: spite, in other words. Under evolutionary conditions known to favour spite rather than altruism, more equitable behaviour tends to emerge. Additionally, empirical studies have shown that there’s a wide array of cultural variation in response to the ultimatum game.

Given the complexity of punishment, it’s improbable that the phenomenon has a single evolutionary explanation. Not all punishment serves to promote a greater good – and even when it does, it might not have originally evolved for that purpose anyway. We should take seriously the possibility that even virtuous penalties have vicious origins.

If so, this can help to explain a number of notable tendencies. We tend to punish even when it is ineffective; we punish some groups more than others; and punishment is often disproportionate to the offence. Many of us view this as problematic only after some careful reflection. If we get a better grasp on the origins of punishment, we might understand why so much of our behaviour causes more harm than good.

A North Carolina man was all smiles Thursday after being reunited with his boat in Riviera Beach. "Yeah, there's my boat. I can't believe it," said Jonathan Bryant. "I thought I'd left her out there. I felt guilty, you know?"In late March, Bryant and his 75-year-old uncle decided to take their 18-foot, 1965 Pearson Packet sailboat from Key West to Cuba. On April 9, just 30 miles into their return trip, 15-foot waves and bad weather forced them to make a mayday call. Luckily, a container ship heading to Mexico was nearby and rescued them from their disabled boat. Bryant said he had mixed emotions. He was happy to be alive but sad to see his boat, Bluebelle, which he had spent three years restoring, just float away. He thought he'd never see it again. However, a week later, Bluebelle was found a quarter-mile off the coast of Palm Beach after a 300 plus mile journey across the Caribbean Sea. On Thursday, Bryant says he drove 14 hours from North Carolina to get his baby back. "I was always living in hope, just a little bit. I didn't want to quit, and I was just getting to the point where it was time to move on. It's quite a special relationship, a man and his boat. It happened and I was like woo-yeah!" Tow boat captain Chris Shaffner, who brought the boat in, tracked down Bryant through the Coast Guard after he spotted Bluebelle floating near the coast. Shaffner said: "It's just a good story. The boat continued to float and made its way here, and it all worked out, which doesn't happen that much anymore." Shaffner added the boat was about 30 minutes from being destroyed on some rocks near the shore when he got to it.

En Egypte, le vote pour le référendum d’amendement de la Constitution a commencé, ce samedi 20 avril, et durera trois jours. Quelque 61 millions d’électeurs sont appelés à se prononcer, en Egypte et à l’étranger, sur la prolongation du mandat présidentiel. Abdel Fattah al-Sissi pourra rester au pouvoir jusqu’en 2030 au lieu de 2022. Les amendements confèrent aussi à l’armée des pouvoirs accrus et réservent aux femmes 25 % des sièges du Parlement. Un référendum où le « Oui » est sûr de l’emporter et où la seule incertitude concerne le taux de participation.

avec nos correspondants au Caire, Alexandre Buccianti et Eric de Lavarène

Pour obtenir un taux de participation respectable, le gouvernement a décrété le branlebas de combat. Des bannières colorées, des minibus qui sillonnent les avenues pour appeler au vote, mais aussi des distributions de jus de fruits, de café, de teeshirts et autres cadeaux présidentiels: les rues du Caire ont pris le visage de ce référendum constitutionnel.

Les formations politiques soutenant le Raïs ont mobilisé leurs militants mais ont aussi engagé des extras aussi est-ce la fiesta devant les bureaux de vote, surtout dans les quartiers populaires. A Shoubra, le quartier le plus populeux du Caire, des hauts parleurs diffusent des chansons patriotiques parfois dansantes. Des drapeaux égyptiens sont distribués aux électeurs. Des jeunes aident les vieux et les analphabètes. Beaucoup de femmes au foyer sont souvent accompagnées de leurs enfants et certaines dansent après avoir voté. Plus tôt dans la journée, à l’ouverture des bureaux de vote, c’était plutôt les retraités qui faisaient la queue.

Les opposants se font discrets

Devant les bureaux de vote, de longues files d’attente se sont formées. Kamel nous explique qu'il a voté oui pour un changement de Constitution qui permettra à l’actuel président de rester potentiellement maître du pays jusqu’en 2030. « Je suis content de voter pour que le pays continue d’avancer dans la bonne direction, sans plus de révolution ou de manifestation comme avant. Merci Dieu. Il y a désormais plus de sécurité, on n’a plus peur de sortir ou d’aller travailler ».

Les opposants au oui eux se font tout petits, comme ce jeune étudiant qui préfère s’éloigner des bureaux de vote et des services de sécurité pour exprimer son mécontentement. « Les gens participent, mais on sait que le résultat sera tronqué à la fin : 97 ou 98% juste pour se donner plus de légitimité ».

Il est difficile au stade actuel du scrutin d’estimer le taux de participation d'autant que le référendum s’étend sur trois jours, au milieu d’un battage médiatique permanent. Les résultats seront donnés avant le Ramadan, dont le commencement est prévu pour le 5 ou le 7 mai.
IEM is returning to Sydney for the third edition of IEM Sydney. The fan favorite event will be featuring 16 teams and a prize pool of $250.000, and it’s definitely the highlight of April.

Just like in past years, Sydney will also see major progresses in various teams’ storylines. FaZe certainly want to defend their title. Renegades will be looking to impress the home crowd with their recent form. Liquid is looking for redemption.

So, which teams will viewers be eagerly following in IEM Sydney? Let’s take a look below.

FaZe Clan is going up, can they keep up?

The last two weeks have been really positive for FaZe Clan. The team won BLAST Pro Series Miami and qualified for ESL Pro League Season 9 Finals. Both results came as a surprise, given FaZe state coming into April.

More specifically, FaZe lack of results and disappointments reached the point where fans were questioning the whole team structure. Still, not everything is perfect and FaZe true test will be at Sydney.

After all, FaZe biggest problem hasn’t been fixed yet. NiKo, one of the teams main fraggers is now also the in-game leader. Other than the two aforementioned results, FaZe was really in a dire situation and the leadership was clearly a problem.

Still, there’s also one clear reason behind FaZe tournament win and qualification for EPL S9. ‘Rain’, who was in a slump for a long time finally returned to his old form in the last week.

While their leadership might be lacking, FaZe form is going to remain this good as long as ‘rain’ maintain his performance. Having NiKo, GuardiaN and Rain fragging and playing to the best is going to give headaches to any opponent.

So, going into Sydney, FaZe and Rain himself will be proving if their forms are back. If they can keep up as they did this past two weeks, FaZe has every chance to successfully defend their title.

Liquid fails to impress in Miami but is looking for revenge in Sydney

Team Liquid fans were hopefully that bringing ‘Stewie2K’ would help Liquid to no crumble into grand-finals. After all, the best North American team reached multiple finals last year but always failed when it mattered the most.

Going for Miami, Liquid had a clearly chance to change this once Astralis failed to book a grand final spot. Liquid was set to face NiKo & Co’s FaZe Clan, and they were clearly the favorites. However, history repeated itself and Liquid was dominated.

Heading to Sydney, Liquid doesn’t have to worry about Astralis once again. Yet, the pressure to finally win a premier title is extremely high and they need to defeat that before anything else.

Should Liquid fail, the whole team structure will be questioned once again. After all, they have exchanged coaches already, but maybe the problem lies with their in-game leader, nitr0.

The pressure is on for Liquid. IEM Sydney will either see a team that finally managed to deal with that after one year of missed opportunities, or a crumbling team that will be looking for changes if results can’t come in.

Mousesports’ new roster first premier event

During the post-Major shuffle, Mousesports went through meaningful roster changes. Replacing Oskar, suNny and STYKO enters Woxic, Karrigan and frozen. Mouz’ results have been impressive so far, and it’s time to convert those to a LAN environment.

And that’s why many fans are excited to finally see Mousesports in action live. Frozen is one of the best up and coming European players, and he has ropz to learn from as another young player who achieved success early.

Woxic is also a great addition. After all, he was one of the essential pieces that helped HellRaisers breakthrough last year along ISSAA. Moreover, having Karrigan and ChrisJ as two tactical minds can add a whole new dynamic.

There’s a lot to hype in this Mousesports squad. Even this being their first offline tournament, they should at least get a top 8 finish with such a promising roster. After all, other than Frozen the squad has a lot of experience.

Renegades’ best roster ever is playing in front of their home crowd

There are no doubts that this Renegades is the best iteration of their CSGO squad hands down. They have the right mix of firepower, teamwork and tactics and its working wonders for them.

Going for Sydney, it’s time to showcase all that for the first time in their home territory. Ultimately, IEM Sydney trophy has been lifted by SK and FaZe before, and an Aussie team never had a chance to compete for it like Renegades can do now.

With all that in mind, there should be an extra push for them to play in a peak level. How far their can reach is unknown though, but Renegades is definitely coming to Sydney with their heads up and confident as one of the favorites.

FNATIC battle to the top keeps going on

Last time we saw FNATIC in an offline tournament, the Swedes managed to book a second-place finish in StarSeries Season VII. Yet after that FNATIC was beaten by G2 in EPL and their results were put in doubt. What FNATIC is truly capable of?

Sydney will be the place to see if StarSeries was a bluff or if it was a sign of what the Swedes can achieve. Xizt, who has been criticized a lot by fans, will also be doing a trial by fire as his leadership has been questionable so far.

Yet, FNATIC can also turn this situation in a big triumph. Should they repeat their form from Shanghai and manage to beat the likes of NRG and NiP, they can definitely reach playoffs here. From there on, it will be all up to KRIMZ and Xizt squad.

IEM Sydney will be concluding April and starting May in a high note

IEM Sydney has been an event very hyped by fans and teams alike. After all, the crowd is lively and teams can feel the prestige of a premier IEM tournament.

So, which teams will you be looking forward to watch? Let us know below!
On Monday morning a strange sight appeared, edging its way through the buses, taxis and shoppers on Oxford Street in London.

A bright pink boat, named Berta Cáceres after the murdered Honduran environmental activist, was being pulled carefully through the traffic, eventually coming to a halt in the middle of one of London’s busiest thoroughfares.

Q&A What is Extinction Rebellion? Show Hide Extinction Rebellion is an international protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Demonstration have included blocking bridges to traffic in London and a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who 'have failed us', to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency.

Bemused onlookers watched as activists secured “Berta” to the road, while others glued themselves to its garish hull. And with this act of flamboyant defiance, Extinction Rebellion’s climate protests had begun.

In the five days that followed, thousand of people, from pensioners to young parents with toddlers, scientists to city workers, teenagers to teachers, have occupied four landmarks in the capital, defying repeated police attempts to remove them and causing widespread disruption. Smaller disruptive events have taken place across the UK and in 33 other countries.

By late Friday evening police were saying that 682 people had been arrested in London. Three supporters who glued themselves to a train on Wednesday have been imprisoned. That same day four more attached themselves to the fence outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house, declaring the Labour leader “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the unfolding climate crisis.

And on Friday about 20 young protesters, all born after 1990, unfurled a banner on a road outside Heathrow airport, asking: “Are we the the last generation?”

But perhaps the protesters’ biggest achievement is that millions of people have heard their message that the world is in a spiralling climate emergency that demands transformative change to avoid catastrophe.

Through hundreds of articles, editorials, and radio and TV interviews, including some hostile critiques of its tactics, Extinction Rebellion’s message has gone mainstream.

“It’s been a resounding success,” said one of the group’s organisers, Howard Rees, surveying the scene on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday afternoon. “What are we on? Day four? We are holding all the sites, we are attracting loads of new members, everybody’s having a great time, there’s a party atmosphere everywhere … the police are generally positive and friendly towards us and agree with what we’re doing. And we are getting our message out there. It couldn’t be going better, really.”

The four occupied sites, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, were all blockaded in quick succession on Monday morning, bringing widespread disruption to central London.

And although activists gathering in the sunshine on Waterloo Bridge had no idea how long they would be there – or what the police reaction would be – there was a jubilant atmosphere as they swarmed on to the road.

“I am so worried about what’s happening to the planet,” said Laura Sorensen, a retired teacher from Somerset. “We are on a knife-edge now and I felt strongly that I needed to get out and show myself, rather than just talk about it in the pub.”

A little further along Waterloo Bridge was Josiah Finegan, a 22-year-old who had never been on a protest before.

“I am freaking out about the climate, to be honest,” he said. “There have been so many warnings from scientists about what we are facing, it is quite shocking.”

Before going to join the protest, Finegan added: “I have no idea what to expect or what might happen … I just heard about it and felt I had to come.”

Police mingled with protesters, chatting and watching as flowers, trees in large tubs, a mini skate ramp and even a lorry were dragged into place on the normally traffic-choked bridge.

Looking on, one senior officer said the police response would be proportionate.

“These people are explicitly peaceful, they have liaised closely with us over their plans and have a legitimate cause. We all have a limit on what we think is the right level of action to take but I think everyone is worried about climate change.”

Over the ensuing days, the success, tactics and sheer determination of the demonstrations took many by surprise, even though they had been more than a year in the planning.

The strategy of peaceful mass disruption was tested in a much smaller series of protests over air pollution last year, with activists blocking busy junctions for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. The group hopes such protests act in two ways: they put economic pressure on the government by disrupting the infrastructure, and they force people to confront the reality of the climate emergency by interrupting their daily lives.

Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough put climate in spotlight Read more

Once they had honed the process, organisers spent months holding public meetings around the country. Thousands of people gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the climate emergency and what they could do about it, with hundreds signing up to take part in larger-scale rebellions and be arrested.

Speaking to the Guardian after a meeting last summer, Roger Hallam, one of the key figures behind this week’s protests, said: “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing.”

Ten months later, it seems he was right.

The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why | André Spicer Read more

The group’s success this week has not come without internal tensions, exacerbated by the non-hierarchical structure of the group. The decision to block trains, and potentially tubes, was hotly debated long into the night on Tuesday. A similar discussion took place over the plan to hit Heathrow.

And as the week has gone on, and the attention of the world’s media has slowly turned to the protests, the pressure on the volunteers trying to organise and control it has only increased.

“The phones never stop ringing, we have press inquiries round the clock from media around the world … it wasn’t like this at my old job,” said one of Extinction Rebellion’s young media team, who took a break from her career to volunteer a few months ago. “But this has been one of the most exhausting, exhilarating weeks of my life.”

Extinction Rebellion says thousands of people are signing up every day. The group’s rise to prominence has come amid mounting evidence of climate breakdown, from floods to heatwaves, melting ice sheets to poor harvests.

Its message about the scale of the climate crisis has resonated because it is backed up with science. On Thursday night David Attenborough presented a primetime documentary on the BBC, Climate Change: The Facts, supporting Extinction Rebellion’s central claim that the world is in a climate emergency. Earlier in the week, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform.

As the sun goes down on Waterloo Bridge on Thursday night, Finegan is dancing and laughing with a group of 20 or so people of all ages and backgrounds, accompanied by a collection of drummers and other musicians.

“It’s been insane, amazing,” he says. “I have been worrying about this stuff so much but the last few days, well, I feel like this has changed everything.”
Israel has the full arsenal needed to take on Hezbollah in Lebanon and eliminate the Iranian threat in Syria, the outgoing IDF Northern Command chief boasted, warning Damascus against using S-300s to protect its sovereignty.

“If our freedom of movement is threatened, we will remove the threat. We know how to do that,” General Yoel Strick told Ynet News, adding that Israel will soon introduce “advanced weapons systems” to ensure it can continue to violate neighboring states’ airspace and to strike targets in Syria with impunity.

If the Syrians employ Russian S-300s against our planes, and we take them out, it will be seen as a legitimate move on our part.

While acknowledging that such a drastic move might damage Tel Aviv's relations with Moscow, Strick expressed hope that it wouldn’t come to that. Moscow had supplied the Arab Republic with S-300 air defense systems following the downing of a Russian Il-20 reconnaissance plane with 15 airmen on board in mid-September, during an Israeli raid.

Moscow also warned Israel that it will suppress all satellite navigation, radars and communications systems of combat planes over the Mediterranean Sea if their maneuvers threaten Russian forces. Since then, Israel has been staging its intrusions via Lebanon, where the Jewish State is trying to keep Hezbollah in check.

Hezbollah is inseparable from Lebanon as a country, due to the militant group’s strong political presence, the general argued. Thus, he claimed, “if it were up to me, I would recommend declaring war on Lebanon and Hezbollah” – not out of bloodlust but only to thwart the group’s alleged plot to “invade” Israel.

I have no doubt what the outcome will be… It will be a decisive victory.

A Washington state Republican politician took part in private discussions with rightwing figures about carrying out surveillance, “psyops” and even violent attacks on perceived political enemies, according to chat records obtained by the Guardian.

State representative Matt Shea, who represents Spokane Valley in the Washington state house, participated in the chats with three other men. All of the men used screen aliases – Shea’s was “Verum Bellator”, Latin for true warrior. The Guardian confirmed the identity of those in the chat by cross-checking phone numbers attached to the Signal accounts.

Intelligence report appeared to endorse view leftwing protesters were 'terrorists' Read more

The group included Jack Robertson, who broadcasts a far-right radio show, Radio Free Redoubt, under the alias “John Jacob Schmidt”. The chat also included Anthony Bosworth, whose history includes a public altercation with his own daughter and bringing guns to a court house. Bosworth participated in the 2016 occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge, reportedly at Shea’s request.

The name of another participant, who provided the chat records to the Guardian, has been withheld due to concerns about personal safety.

The chats on the messaging app Signal took place in the days leading up to a supposed “Antifa revolt” on 4 November 2017. Throughout late October, far-right media outlets had been stoking fears of political conflict on the basis of planned peaceful protests by a small leftist group.

The men proposed to confront leftists – whom they repeatedly refer to as “communists” and “Antifa” – with a suite of tactics, including violence.

Other acts of extreme violence were also suggested. When a specific female Spokane resident was nominated for surveillance in the chat group, Robertson suggested:

Apart from violence, the men extensively discussed tactics of surveillance and intimidation.

Shea, the elected Republican legislator, did not demur from any of these suggestions. He also appeared willing to participate directly in surveillance of activists.

In response to a request in the chat for background checks on Spokane residents, Shea volunteered to help, going on to name three individuals – including an organizer for the liberal group Indivisible, and a college professor.

The men talked about the broad outlines of what they appeared to consider to be a looming civil war. They also discussed using symbols from what they understood to be Russian anti-communist groups as a way of spreading paranoia among their adversaries.

The group talked about making stickers and cards using skull and crossbones images from post-revolutionary Russian nationalist groups. After posting an image of a white army soldier holding such a banner, Bosworth remarked:

When the leftist revolt failed to materialize, Shea did not rethink his conspiratorial views and instead blamed the weather.

Shea, a six-term legislator and military veteran, came to international attention in 2018 after a document he authored surfaced laying out a “biblical basis for war”, which appeared to be a plan for an apocalyptic battle with people who practiced “same sex marriage” and “abortion”, and instructed: “If they do not yield, kill all males.”

Shea denied that the document meant what it appeared to say.

At that time, Shea lost donors, and he was stripped of his role as chair of the Republican caucus – though he was serving in this position at the time of the leaked chat.

But Shea has since regrouped, introducing bills to criminalize abortion and roll back gun laws, which other Republicans in Washington have supported. He has also continued pushing a plan for eastern Washington to secede and reconstitute as Liberty State. Robertson has also been a key architect of this campaign, and he and Shea have been regular guests on each other’s broadcasts.

Shea has long promoted conspiratorial views about the cooperation of leftists and Muslims in creating “counter-states” in the US. He has associated with conspiracy-minded far-right groups, and later this month will emcee a dinner for the anti-communist John Birch society in Couer D’Alene, Idaho.

In a telephone conversation with the Guardian, Robertson said: “I remember a discussion in response to Indivisible and Antifa groups that were planning to take to the streets,” but “I don’t recall the details”.

He denied surveilling his political opponents, but added: “If someone is in my community and they are threatening violence, I want to know more about them. That just makes sense.”

He also claimed that the apparent threats of violence were not authentic.

“A lot of people in private conversations say things tongue in cheek about what they would like to see happen to these people, but that is not setting a policy or establishing a protocol for people to carry things out.”

Some of Shea’s most prominent critics have been political conservatives. Spokane county’s Republican sheriff, Ozzie Knezovich, has repeatedly criticized Shea’s far-right ties.

“It’s part and parcel of what this group has been saying for years. I think if a state representative is condoning violence against his constituents then that person needs to be removed from office, and I hope the voters will do that at the next election.

“Matt Shea is a poor representative for the Republican party. Extremism on both sides is tearing this country apart,” Knezovich added.

Asked if the people around Shea were dangerous, Knezovich said: “Yes.”

US hate groups have seen ideas enter mainstream in Trump era, report finds Read more

The Western States Center, a progressive organization, has also previously criticized Shea. Its executive director, Eric Ward, said via email: “The violent extremism that Representative Matt Shea espouses is a clear threat to our democratic institutions and has no place in mainstream political discourse.

“We call on Washington State Republican Party leaders to censure Representative Shea if these allegations are true.”

Shea did not respond to a request for comment.

After the Guardian contacted Robertson and Shea for comment Robertson spoke on Thursday night on the Spokane Christian radio station on which he and Shea broadcast weekly programs.

In a rambling broadcast, Robertson confirmed the existence of the chats, called the Guardian a “propagandist”, read biblical accounts of war and followed with: “If it comes time for war and it’s forced upon you, do you not want a leader who is going to surround himself with warriors? I do.

“There was talk about doing surveillance on some of these Antifa people. Not surveillance but just start copying and pasting their comments, keeping track of who’s who, keep track of where they live, where they work, but that never came to fruition,” he added.
I’d hate it when some old-time police sergeant, usually an old white guy but sometimes black, would stand, hand on hip and sigh.

And in the laconic and bitterly ironic tone of Chicago police, he’d make the big speech of five words:

“Gonna be a bad summer.”

I’d cringe, because, well, who the hell doesn’t know this?

People are outside in summer. Rich people go places. But poor people go outside. And in Chicago, guns go outside with them.

Calling it “gun violence” lets local politicians off the hook, because they want to shift the blame away from the lousy schools they’ve provided and taxes that cripple or drive away businesses so there are no jobs.

The proper name is “gang violence,” and the gangs kill people over drugs, money, over revenge, over nothing, over they just felt like it.

It was always going to be a bad summer. But something happened the other day on the West Side that makes me think that old archetype of a sergeant may be right this time.

Authorities confirmed that two police officers — TAC cops, not rookies — were making a drug arrest shortly after 2 p.m. on Sunday.

A mob appeared, threatening the officers, surrounding them, threatening to reach for their own weapons to shoot them dead, and the cops let the suspect go.

What is learned here? The street is officially no longer afraid of the Chicago police.

Two arrested after group threatened Chicago cop on West Side, helping suspect escape »

If the cops had fired their weapons, news media would have been all over them, metaphorically skinning them alive. Politicians would have demanded their heads. Democratic presidential candidates, and the two campaigning for mayor, would have held repeated news conferences.

But this? Nothing.

I don’t see politicians convening blue ribbon panels of experts. I don’t see media bringing all the light they can bring to this. Tribune reporter William Lee crafted a compelling story, but one story isn’t enough.

The cops know they’re alone. That’s not a good prescription for what may come.

I’ve never heard of that before, of cops so intimidated during an arrest that they’d back off. And I wonder what message that sends, to cops, to the street, and what will come of it.

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, the department’s chief communications officer, sent me this statement:

“Multiple times each day, Chicago police officers encounter dangerous and potentially unstable situations in the name of creating a safer neighborhood for all Chicagoans. The department supports the officer’s measured response to a situation that could have deteriorated and put lives at risk. Our message to the offender — we know who you are, and you will be held accountable for your actions.”

It was a measured response. It could have deteriorated and put lives at risk. People could have died, including the cops, and innocents down the block, and even some of the mob that began shouting.

And then where would we be?

According to authorities, the two tactical officers were making the drug arrest on Sunday afternoon in the West 4700 block of Gladys Avenue in West Garfield Park.

Police who had viewed the body camera footage told me one officer dealt with the suspect and another stood a few feet away, watching a bystander who was making threats.

Then, someone reached into the squad car and took seized drugs. The officer standing a few feet away ran to chase the drug thief, and the mob began pressing and threatening the other officer with the suspect. A shot was fired a block away.

A police radio recording of the incident shared with me lays it out.

“Ten people surrounded me indicating they had firearms, then one person away from me … holding his waist … indicating he’d use the firearm against me.”

That’s difficult to put your mind around, that people on the street have lost their fear of the cops. And what comes next? Who can say? But others will push the envelope, and others will push back, and it ends badly.

I asked rank-and-file police to weigh in, on Facebook and Twitter; unfortunately, regulations prevent them from talking. That’s something the next mayor should address. Preventing people from discussing terrors on the job simply builds resentments.

“I don’t know what was going through that officer’s head, but I guess part of it was he didn’t want to shoot anyone, and wind up charged and in jail like (Jason) Van Dyke,” wrote an officer via email. “Like I said I wasn’t there so I can’t second guess him or read his mind.

“The criminals are emboldened to challenge the police because the politicians and media will not stand up for the police and are only too happy for any excuse to jump on the police to gain political support... Now there is no fear of going to jail.”

Did the officer do the right thing by letting the suspect go? Schools of thought vary. It’s easy to say this or that when you’re calm at a typewriter and there’s no sweat trickling down your back.

But what will happen is that the guys who hang on the corners of 4700 W. Gladys will see more cops, and soon.

Two of them talked to me, as others drove past, slow, to watch.

“Yeah, yeah, I know you,” said a pleasant man who called himself “John” on the corner on Thursday. The other guy looked at my ID, and said his name was “Kass.”

“It wasn’t no ‘mob.’ But this is the hood, man,” said John.

“This (stuff) happens in the hood.”

Not this (stuff), I said.

“It do now,” he said.

Some Microsoft employees are openly questioning whether diversity is important, in a lengthy discussion on an internal online messaging board meant for communicating with CEO Satya Nadella.

Two posts on the board criticizing Microsoft diversity initiatives as “discriminatory hiring” and suggesting that women are less suited for engineering roles have elicited more than 800 comments, both affirming and criticizing the viewpoints, multiple Microsoft employees have told Quartz. The posts were written by a female Microsoft program manager. Quartz reached out to her directly for comment, and isn’t making her name public at this point, pending her response.

“Does Microsoft have any plans to end the current policy that financially incentivizes discriminatory hiring practices? To be clear, I am referring to the fact that senior leadership is awarded more money if they discriminate against Asians and white men,” read the original post by the Microsoft program manager on Yammer, a corporate messaging platform owned by Microsoft. The employee commented consistently throughout the thread, making similar arguments. Quartz reviewed lengthy sections of the internal discussion provided by Microsoft employees.

“I have an ever-increasing file of white male Microsoft employees who have faced outright and overt discrimination because they had the misfortune of being born both white and male. This is unacceptable,” the program manager wrote in a comment later. The Microsoft employees who spoke to Quartz said they weren’t aware of any action by the company in response, despite the comments being reported to Microsoft’s human resources department.

When contacted by Quartz, Microsoft pointed to comments by three company officials in the message-board threads. A member of Microsoft’s employee investigations team responded to the initial post in January, writing that the company does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. Another Microsoft staff member, who leads the team that helps the board of directors determine executive pay, explained the diversity-based compensation initiative. “Our board and executive leadership team believe diverse and inclusive teams are good for business and consistent with our mission and inspire-to culture,” she wrote. “Linking compensation to these aspirations is an important demonstration of executive commitment to something we believe strongly in.

“Many women simply aren’t cut out for the corporate rat race, so to speak, and that’s not because of ‘the patriarchy…’”

The internal debate over the merits of diversity comes as Microsoft is grappling with an uproar over allegations of sexism and sexual harassment that some staff said the company hasn’t adequately responded to over the years. It is also a powerful glimpse into internal dissent against efforts by the world’s biggest tech companies to increase the number of women and people of color on staff, in the face of criticism that those groups are underrepresented, especially in the leadership ranks.

The Microsoft author echoes former Google employee James Damore, who in 2017 wrote a memo that went internally viral at Google, leaning on pseudoscience to argue that women aren’t cut out for the tech industry. Damore was fired for breaching the company’s code of conduct amid enormous public and internal controversy, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a memo that the firing was due to “advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.”

Below is a selection of comments from the Microsoft employee, with the capitalization for emphasis in the original comments by the employee:

“Because women used to be actively prohibited from full-time employment many decades ago, there is now the misguided belief that women SHOULD work, and if women AREN’T working, there’s something wrong…. Many women simply aren’t cut out for the corporate rat race, so to speak, and that’s not because of ‘the patriarchy,’ it’s because men and women aren’t identical, and women are much more inclined to gain fulfillment elsewhere.” “We still lack any empirical evidence that the demographic distribution in tech is rationally and logically detrimental to the success of the business in this industry….We have a plethora of data available that demonstrate women are less likely to be interested in engineering AT ALL than men, and it’s not because of any *ism or *phobia or ‘unconscious bias’- it’s because men and women think very differently from each other, and the specific types of thought process and problem solving required for engineering of all kinds (software or otherwise) are simply less prevalent among women. This is an established fact. However, this established fact makes people very uncomfortable, because it suggests that the gender distribution in engineering might not actually be a problem (and thus women can no longer bleat about being victims of sexism in the workplace), these facts are ignored in favor of meaningless platitudes our SLT [senior leadership team] continues to shove down our throats – e.g. ‘We’re not doing enough’ and ‘we clearly have a long way to go.’” “We MUST immediately cease the practice of attaching financial incentives and performance metrics to ‘diversity hiring’ – as long as we give more money and higher annual reviews explicitly for NOT hiring/promoting white men and Asians, this will continue to be a serious problem at the company.”

Whiskey – Tango – Foxtrot !!

There has been a widespread media claim for two years that Robert Mueller’s special counsel team never leaked. However, today, while entirely obfuscating the lede aspect to their admission/story, Buzzfeed News outlines how FBI agents assigned to Robert Mueller’s team actually leaked documents from their investigation to the media.

This admission is stunning…. I don’t even think Buzzfeed realizes what they are admitting to here. It’s in these paragraphs (emphasis mine):

(Buzzfeed) […] I’d also like to share an accounting of how we came to our characterization, to give our audience and people who reasonably raised questions about our reporting as much information as possible about how the story came to be. Our story was based on detailed information from senior law enforcement sources. That reporting included documents — specifically, pages of notes that were taken during an interview of [Michael] Cohen by the FBI.

In those notes, one law enforcement source wrote that “DJT personally asked Cohen to say negotiations ended in January and White House counsel office knew Cohen would give false testimony to Congress. Sanctioned by DJT. Joint lawyer team reviewed letter Cohen sent to SSCI about his testimony about Trump Tower moscow, et al, knowing it contained lies.” The law enforcement source also wrote: “Cohen told OSC” — the Office of Special Counsel — “he was asked to lie by DJT/DJT Jr., lawyers.” At the time, the sources asked reporters to keep the information confidential, but with the publication of Mueller’s report they have permitted its release. (read more)

Do you realize what Buzzfeed is saying right there?

The FBI gave copies of their FD-302 reports (investigative notes) to Buzfeed news !!

Notice the use of the plural “reporters“; specifically the way “reporters” is used in the paragraph, infers that multiple media outlets were given the same FBI leaked documents.

Tell me again about the honorable “rank and file”… I digress.

The lead investigative member of the FBI for Robert Mueller was FBI Special Agent David Archey. Presumably, according to the narrative, Special Agent Archey took over after it was determined the text-message evidence of Pete Strzok’s political bias was a taint upon the investigative unit.

(outlined in FBI declarations about Comey Memos)

Mr. David W. Archey is currently the head of the FBI Richmond, VA field office.

It would appear Buzzfeed has inadvertently opened up a solid reason for yet another FBI internal investigation. Obviously, it would be a simple process for the FBI to look at who conducted the FBI interviews of Michael Cohen. This is not a complex puzzle.

Right there, staring everyone in the face, is direct and demonstrable evidence of two, yes plural, leakers in the FBI… Apparently the 2018 “bias training” espoused by FBI Director Christopher Wray did not include these two agents.

Do you think anyone else will catch this?… or do anything about this?

Here’s a reference point to help answer that question [From 2018]

Toyota driver Ott Tanak says he is "taking more care" and avoiding "unnecessary risk" in a bid to turn around his fortunes and win a first World Rally Championship title this year.

Tanak's title bid fell apart last year despite winning the most stages and four consecutive rallies in the second half of the season, in what was accepted as the best package of car and driver.

Tanak heads to next week's Rally Argentina five points behind championship leader Thierry Neuville and chasing back-to-back victories in Villa Carlos Paz after winning the same event last year.

He says he is willing to take a more cautious approach for the remainder of the season in a bid to fight for the title.

"I'm taking a bit more care about everything," said Yaris WRC driver Tanak.

"We don't want any more setbacks this season and we really need to think about the places where we are at risk and in those places we don't take the unnecessary risk.

"The approach now is about the championship.

"We saw in Corsica that [Sebastien] Ogier could still make the points on the hard days - he is a clever guy for this.

"I also saw that for myself in Turkey last year, when I was nowhere, with no speed and no chance to compete early in the event and then we managed to win."

"I can still develop in a lot of areas. I know I can do better and I want to go as far as I possibly can. When I am hitting my limit then I will feel it and I will stop. I can get faster and more consistent. I'm not near my limit yet, there's still more to give."

Leading the championship going into the last round in Corsica, Tanak was frustrated by a puncture which took him out of the victory battle.

Toyota team boss Tommi Makinen admitted the issue was the by-product of a rim-suspension set-up which was sending too much stress through the tyre.

The Puppolla-based team suffered the same issues in Monte Carlo, when it ran lightweight rims.

Makinen was quick to stress the fault didn't lie with long-time WRC wheel supplier OZ Racing.

"It's something in the set-up," Makinen told Autosport.

"We need to find a way to give the suspension more space and take away some of the stress from the rim.

"It's not fair to call this a puncture because we are losing the air in a strange way."

Tanak was speaking at the premiere of a film which has been made about him in Estonia, which launched last week.
The number of single female home buyers over the age of 30 has been increasing in China, according to Beike, a Chinese real estate platform.

The report combed data on second-hand housing transactions in 12 major cities, including Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai, and surveyed around 1,000 women aged between 18 and 50.

In 2018, about 47.9 percent of the second-hand home buyers were women, up from 30 percent in 2014, the report said.

Meanwhile, about 47 percent of single women over the age of 30 have bought apartments, the report said.

"The rise in the number of single women homeowners shows the elevated social and economic status of women in China," said Liu Lu, professor of economics at Southwest University of Finance and Economics.

As more women are educated and highly-paid in big cities, the trend is likely to expand, she said.

Zhang Yan, a 31-year-old graduate of the prestigious Tsinghua University, bought a 50-square-meter apartment in Beijing.

"I pay 7,000 yuan (1,040 U.S. dollars) for the monthly mortgage payment, but the loan hardly has any impact on the quality of my life," she said.

Among the number of single female buyers, 45 percent of them need financial help from parents when purchasing a house, and 29 percent said they paid for it on their own, the report said.

"Many Chinese parents chipped in for the down payment as a support and also an investment," said Liu.

Real estate developers are catering to the needs of higher-earning women in apartment design with larger dressing spaces and wardrobes.
Eine Drohmail mit rechtsradikalem Hintergrund sorgte am 28. März 2019 für die Evakuierung der Ida-Ehre-Schule. Während die Polizei schnell Entwarnung gab, nimmt die AfD den Vorfall zum Anlass, eine weitere Senatsanfrage zu dem aus AfD-Sicht nicht neutralen Harvestehuder Gymnasium zu stellen. Diesmal geht es um diverse Twitternachrichten, aus denen die Partei den Verdacht ableitet, die Bombendrohung stamme in Wahrheit von den von der AfD verhassten Antifaschisten.

AfD-Fraktionschef Alexander Wolf deutet in der Anfrage an, dass die Leitung der Ida-Ehre-Schule mit der Linken-Fraktion und der Antifa-Altona-Ost unter einer Decke stecke und sich mit ihnen am Tag der Bombendrohung abgesprochen habe, noch bevor sie die Schulbehörde informiert habe.

Zur Begründung des ungeheuerlichen Verdachts, die rechtsradikale Drohung sei in Wahrheit mit Wissen der Schulleitung von Linken inszeniert worden, werden die Uhrzeiten angegeben, zu denen die Beteiligten sich am Tattag angeblich auf Twitter geäußert hätten.



Stellt viele Anfragen zur antifaschistischen Ida-Ehre-Schule: Alexander Wolf, AfD dpa Foto:

Laut AfD twitterte die Abgeordneten Christiane Schneider in aller Herrgottsfrühe als erste über die Bombendrohung, nämlich am 28. März um 05.41 Uhr, gefolgt von einem Tweet der Schule um 06.05 Uhr und einem Tweet der „Antifa Altona Ost“ um 6.39 Uhr. Um 07.48 Uhr habe sich dann die Bürgerschaftsfraktion der Linken via Twitter zu Wort gemeldet.



Die Bombendrohung, unterzeichnet mit dem Namen eines verstorbenen österreichischen Nazis, ging aber nachweislich erst um 10.17 Uhr bei der Schule ein. Wie kann das sein?



Das sagt der Senat zu der Unterstellung

In der Senatsantwort wird die Verschwörungstheorie entkräftet: Liest jemand einen Tweet, ohne sich bei Twitter anzumelden, wird nicht die Zeitzone angezeigt, in der er sich gerade befindet, sondern die Zeitzone Pacific Standard Time, in der sich der Server des Unternehmens befindet.



Im Fall der fraglichen Tweets bedeutet das einen Zeitunterschied von acht Stunden. „Die Annahme, dass die für Bildung zuständige Behörde erst nach den Meldungen via Twitter Kenntnis von der Bombendrohung erhalten hat, trifft nicht zu", stellt der Senat klar. Und weiter: „Der Beauftragte für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit der Ida Ehre Schule hatte im Auftrag der Schulleitung um 14.05 Uhr via Twitter den Vorfall kommuniziert."



Empört von der Unterstellung, sie habe etwas mit der Drohmail zu tun: Christiane Schneider, Linke dpa Foto:

Christiane Schneider, Vizepräsidentin der Bürgerschaft, reagiert empört auf die Anfrage der Rechtspopulisten: „Diese unsägliche Unterstellung treibt die rechtsextreme Kampagne gegen antifaschistisches Engagement auf die Spitze und macht wieder einmal deutlich, dass Hetze bei der AfD zum Programm gehört und dabei jedes Mittel recht zu sein scheint."

In der rechten Drohmail wurde gegen die „rote Schule" gehetzt und es ging ausdrücklich um die antifaschistischen Aufkleber, die die Schulbehörde nach einer AfD-Anfrage Tage zuvor aus dem Schulgebäude der Ida-Ehre-Schule hatte entfernen lassen.
Legendary mid-laner. Aggressive ADC. Filled support. Team creator. Back-door nexus destroyer. Enrique “xPeke” Cedeño Martínez has been known as many things throughout his League of Legends career, but one thing is certain – if fans have paid any attention to the European scene at any point since its inception, they know xPeke.

Though only long time fans remember it now, xPeke began his professional career in the top lane. After a couple of months with organizations like oSk Gaming and myRevenge, he was picked up by Fnatic. Coming in late due to passport issues, he joined them during the knockout stage of the Riot Season 1 Championship and took over for Bram “wewillfailer” de Winter to help secure first place in the tournament.

Fnatic

After this short stint as a top-laner, he went to the mid lane, swapping roles with Maciej “Shushei” Ratuszniak. This switch lead to the most successful part of xPeke’s career, and the role where he truly became one of the Legends of League. Soon joined by other historic Fnatic players like Paul “sOAZ” Boyer, Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim, and Martin “Rekkles” Larsson, Fnatic furthered their journey to becoming a long term powerhouse in Europe.

Throughout seasons two and three, xPeke made a name for himself as being a highly skilled player with an impressive champion pool. He combined game knowledge, map awareness, and mechanical skill to be one of the top names in the league.

Despite having a long and varied career, what xPeke is possibly still most known for this day is his backdoor play at IEM Katowice in January of 2013. Though the team failed to win the tournament, they created one of the most famous and exciting plays in the history of the game. With nearly no health remaining, he snuck into the enemy base and took down their exposed nexus while evading two enemy champions.

Later that same year, he had another play that was equally impressive, yet less well known than his Kassadin game-winner. Though it didn’t result in winning the game for his team, this escape on Nidalee showcased exceptional knowledge of the champion, map, and enemy team. With a slight assist from sOAZ on Karma at the end, xPeke completed one of the most epic escapes of professional League history.

Origen

After three and a half successful years with Fnatic, xPeke parted ways with the organization to pursue an ambitious goal. He created Origen, a new team made up of experienced veterans and skilled newcomers. Leading from the mid-lane, xPeke and the new team joined the EUCS. They went nearly undefeated throughout the Spring Split, and easily qualified for the EU LCS, partially due to another xPeke backdoor play. This one wasn’t quite as dramatic as the other, but emphasized the level of map awareness and game knowledge that helped him become so successful.

Though Fnatic kept a firm hold on the top spot, Origen made an impressive showing in their first professional season. Battling their way through the split, they ended in second place, even taking two games off of Fnatic in the finals. This top-two finish brought some validation to his decision to leave Fnatic, create his own team and silenced some of his critics.

At the 2015 World Championships, they made their mark, not only making it out of their group, but becoming the first Western team to win a Best of 5 series when they defeated the Flash Wolves. Though they were knocked out by SKT who went on to win the tournament, Origen far exceeded the usual expectations for such a new team. At the head of this success was xPeke, providing a cool head in team fights as well as some impressive plays.

Following this international success, xPeke decided to take a half-step out of the limelight. He decided to take on a more managerial role for the organization and bring Tristan “PowerOfEvil” Schrage in to share Mid Lane duty. He played only a few games during the split, and the team did well overall. However, things went downhill sharply after the break. With some members leaving, they had to swiftly rebuild the roster. By Week 4, xPeke was needed to fill in as the starting ADC, and did as well as could be expected considering the circumstances. The team struggled, and barely managed to avoid relegation.

Struggles continued

At the start of the next season, Origen showed up with a completely new starting roster, with xPeke as a substitute option once again. Somehow, they struggled even more than they had the year before, and halfway through the split, xPeke became their starting support in an effort to salvage their season. Unfortunately, all efforts proved futile, and Origen was relegated from the EU LCS.

Origen and xPeke mostly disappeared from the public eye after this, other than a failed Challenger Series run and a brief All-Star revival at the European Masters 2018, little was heard from them. That is, until it was announced that they would be partnering with Astralis, rejoining the LEC in 2019. The team found success this year, taking their season all the way to the Spring Split Finals, where they lost to G2 Esports.

So who is xPeke?

Though only those close to him really know Enrique Cedeño Martínez, millions of fans have gotten to know xPeke. Though not always successful in every position, he played every role but Jungler during his career showing an unmatched versatility in the game. Most of the big plays he is known for display the same qualities: nerves of steel, incredible game knowledge, and knowing what it takes to win. One thing is for sure, and that is that whether people love him or hate him, he is one of the Legends of League.

IDEAS French is a TIME columnist. A lawyer and senior fellow at the National Review Institute, he is a best-selling author whose next book will be The Great American Divorce

We now know for sure what kind of man Donald Trump is. Beyond the tweets, the rallies, the interviews, the debates, the press conferences, the scandals, the best-selling yet unclearly sourced insider books and the unrelenting braggadocio and aggrandizement, a comprehensive read of the Mueller report brings to life the portrait of the man Donald Trump more than anything before it.

It takes the traits we already knew he exhibited — his mendacity, his propensity to surround himself with crooks and grifters, and his single-minded self-focus — and places them in the context of a sweeping narrative about a presidential campaign and presidency devoid of ethics, honor or even strength. The stories paint a picture of a president who is both petty and small, so very small.

One of the most telling moments occurs on page 102 in the obstruction of justice section of the Special Counsel’s analysis. It tells a short version of a story we largely already knew. When Donald Trump’s son, Donald Junior, learned that the New York Times was about to break the news of his now-infamous June 9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya, his first instinct was to come clean.

He drafted a statement that began, “I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew … with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.” But his father said no. His father demanded that the statement be revised to omit the motivation for the meeting. Donald Jr. complied and misled America.

Think for a moment about that story. With his campaign in the media crosshairs, President Trump threw his son under the bus. He made his son transmit his own deceptions. He exposed his son to the scorn and ridicule he so richly deserved.

There are other important moments in the report. Here’s one we didn’t know before. According to the report, in June 2017, President Trump dictated a message for his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski — who had been fired in June 2016, a few months after a misdemeanor battery charge against him had been brought and then dropped — to dictate to then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump was directing Sessions to essentially reverse his recusal from the Russian investigation to narrow the scope of the Special Counsel’s investigation. Trump wanted Mueller to merely investigate “election meddling for future elections.”

Lewandowski never delivered Trump’s message. He scheduled a meeting with Sessions, but when Sessions canceled, Lewandowski never followed through. A disgraced former campaign manager felt free to disregard a directive from the President of the United States.

It’s difficult to overestimate the extent to which Trump’s appeal to his core supporters is built around the notion that — regardless of his other flaws — he possesses a core strength, a willingness to “fight” and an ability to strike a degree of fear in the hearts of his opponents. I live in the heart of Trump country in Tennessee, and I have consistently heard the same refrain from his most loyal supporters. Trump, as they say, “kicks ass.” He was the ultimate alpha male, a political version of Tony Soprano, a formidable boss who commands an army of loyal consiglieri. Cross him at your peril.

But now, thanks to the Mueller report, his “fights” look more like temper tantrums, and those closest to him — including low men like Lewandowski and far-more-noble men like former White House counsel Donald McGahn — understand that his fury is passing and his directives are unreliable, seemingly transitory and easily forgotten or disregarded.

Moreover, his vaunted personal judgment — an image cultivated through years of careful television production on The Apprentice — has been exposed as well. When one reads Robert Mueller’s account of Trump’s own campaign chair’s extraordinary efforts to maintain an encrypted connection to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, it’s plain that Trump was played. Paul Manafort used Trump’s gullibility as a business opportunity.

But that’s the tip of the iceberg. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, didn’t just lie to the FBI; he lied to members of his own administration. Trump’s informal adviser, Roger Stone, didn’t have the access to Wikileaks that he publicly boasted about. Trump’s son, son-in-law and campaign chair had the terrible judgment to take a meeting with a Russian in the explicit hope of gaining “dirt” on Hillary Clinton to support an admitted Russian plan to help Trump. None of this is admirable. All of it speaks to Trump’s critical flaws.

The Mueller report stands as a monument to reality. It plainly and clearly makes the case that Donald Trump is not the man his supporters think he is. He’s not bold. He’s afraid. They attributed to him a primitive form of loyalty, where he was good to people who were good to him. Instead, he’d harm his own son to win a single news cycle. His foolish hiring decisions have come back to haunt him time and again.

President Trump is weak — too weak even to commit the acts of obstruction he desired. As the Mueller report stated, Trump’s attempts to influence the investigation “were mostly unsuccessful,” but it’s “largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.” He’s not strong. He’s not wise. He’s not honorable. And sometimes, when his subordinates disregard his orders, he’s not even truly the president. Regardless of his potential criminality, there is nothing revealed in the report that is admirable — or alpha — about Donald Trump.

A global transition to 100% renewable energy is possible across the electricity, heat, transport and desalination sectors by 2050, and it can be done for cheaper than the current global energy system, a new study claims.

The study from Energy Watch Group and LUT University of Finland outlines a path to a 1.5°C scenario that is able to achieve “a cost decline without the reliance on high-risk technologies such as nuclear power and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS).” A group of 14 energy transition scientists conducted the study over four and a half years using a “state-of-the-art” modeling simulation.

Solar and wind energy are “the new workhorses of the future” in this new projected global energy system, with solar making up an astonishing 69% of the total energy supply by 2050, requiring a enormous total installed capacity of 63,400 gigawatts. Wind energy would make up 18% of the mix, with bioenergy, hydropower, and geothermal accounting for most of the rest.

The study relies on existing technology and battery storage, with an emphasis on electrification and decentralization. While fossil fuels and nuclear energy phase out completely in this scenario, electricity consumption will account for more than 90% of the primary energy consumption by 2050. Lead researcher Christian Breyer said,

“The study’s results show that all countries can and should accelerate the current Paris Climate Agreement targets. A transition to 100% clean, renewable energies is highly realistic – even today, with the technologies currently available.”

This scenario sees 9 million coal mining jobs phased out by 2050, but “overcompensated” for by more than 15 million new jobs in renewable energy. Researchers also foresee the future system as slightly cheaper, costing 53 €/MWh by 2050, compared to 54 €/MWh by 2015. Getting There Like many other studies, this one places an emphasis on government intervention to “ensure the swift uptake in the development of renewable energy, storage technologies, sector coupling, and smart energy systems.” The researchers make a number of policy recommendations, including: Policies and instruments focused on sector coupling and enabling direct private investment in renewable energy and other zero emission technologies.

Feed-in Tariff laws should be adopted to enable investments (under 40 MW) from decentralised actors, such as small and medium enterprises, cooperatives, communities, farmers and citizens. Tendering procedures for large scale investors should only be applied for utility-scale capacities above 40 MW.

A responsible phase-out of all state subsidies to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation is necessary.

Introduction of carbon, methane and radioactivity taxes.

Incentives created to spur the growth of renewable energy technologies; such as tax exemptions, direct subsidies, and legal privileges.

Policies and frameworks that promote research, education and information sharing on renewable energy and zero emission technologies. President of the Energy Watch Group Hans-Josef Fell said, “The energy transition is not a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but one of political will.”

Electrek’s Take It’s hard to come up with a succinct take on a study that takes up hundreds of pages, but it’s somewhat reassuring that the researchers relied completely on existing technologies here. Though there are plenty of questions one could ask after diving into the study, the reliance on solar energy in this scenario seems like a good place to focus. It’s a massive undertaking to get global solar capacity to the necessary 63,400 GW in this model, as current global estimates place capacity somewhere near 500 GW. Solar capacity grew nearly 100 GW last year — that would have to increase about 20x annually, on average, over the next 30 years. But another way of looking at it is through exponential growth — if solar capacity grows about 17 percent each year, that would also put the world about on track to meet those marks. That rate makes the goal seem more attainable. There’s plenty to debate here, but to quote EWG’s president, meeting any ambitious long-term renewable goals is “a matter of political will.” Costs will go down, and technology will continue to improve. It’s important to aim high.

There has been a recent push to get more people to ride their bikes to work.

To that I say: put the brakes on, honey!

The truth is that influential people are all getting into bed with the Big Bike industry. Despite how uncomfortable that must be, they continue to push for people to get exercise outside by biking to work, but at what cost? Here are 7 reasons breaking down why you shouldn’t feel guilty for leaving your bike to rust in the garage.

1. Riding Your Bike Is Dangerous

People will try to tell you to find a route with less traffic or to be a defensive biker, but forget all of that. There are more distracted drivers every day, texting on their cellphones and weaving in and out of bike lanes. Your brittle human body needs to be encased in 3 tons of metal, hurtling down the road at breakneck speeds, so that you can text and drive with the best of them.

2. You Will Reek

Ew, you are really going to go into work after SWEATING like an ANIMAL?! It’s not like you can carry a change of clothes in your backpack, or splash around in the sink (again, like an animal!) Everyone knows that deodorant is only meant for the mad sprint down the hall when Katie announces that there are extra treats in the breakroom.

3. You Will Look Bad

Since no one else will tell you, I will: in addition to the smell, you will look like a love letter from an angsty teen– crumpled up and thrown on the floor. This is a professional environment, where you should be wearing a suit from the second you step into the building until the moment you get home. Changing in a restroom is not an option– someone might realize that you broke this cardinal rule. My friend Jessie left her office clothes at work to change into. I should say ex-friend. The workplace is not a wardrobe, Jessie!

4. It’s More Work

They call it a “work-out” for a reason. Do you really want to work more hours in a day than you really have to? I don’t see you clocking in the extra hour your commute takes you. Why in the world would you work if you aren’t going to get paid for it? Just wait for the one day a year where they hand out a prize for biking to work. External validation is the only kind you need.

5. The Europeans Do It

There are entire cities in Europe where bicycles are king. “Respectable” business people ride into work in skirts, suits, and all manner of business attire. Frankly, I don’t know how we’re supposed to tell if they are actually respectable if they aren’t driving a Lexus or Audi, but I digress. The important thing here is that if people in Europe do it, then it is probably SOCIALIST, and therefore evil. What next, we follow in their footsteps with affordable healthcare, to pay for all of those people riding bikes perilously in the streets?

6. It’s Boring

Entertainment is the most critical part of your commute. To have a pure podcast or audiobook-listening experience, you need a stereo. Bicyclists have a much harder time hearing over the sounds of nature and wind blowing through their hair.

At least when you are driving you can make funny acronyms out of the license plate that is inching along in front of you in traffic. When you bike, the winding footpaths and bustling urban centers force your mind to wander from what is truly important: all the stuff you need to worry about today.

7. It’s A Cult

Cycopaths are sure to brag how many miles they biked, posting pictures online and high fiving each other. It’s like all those endorphins go straight to their head. But look, if you can’t keep up with them, don’t bother trying. It’s best to be perfect right away, so if you can’t bike a hundred kilometers on your first ride, just give up. Let the gearheads keep their head in the clouds while the rest of us keep our feet planted firmly on the brake.

Conclusion

The result is clear: no amount of smiles per mile is worth the drudgery of biking to work. From risking your life to the impossibilities of dealing with sweat, wrinkled clothing, and rain, there are hundreds of excuses for you to quit.

So next time anyone tries to tell you how ‘awesome’ and ‘freeing’ it is to ride– let them know they have been brainwashed by Big Bike’s socialist agenda. If they don’t believe you, share these 7 inarguable reasons to stop riding to work completely.
The Orville dropped a new episode this week and it was probably the most interesting experience I’ve had watching this show so far. I went from zero enthusiasm for this episode to finding it somewhat thrilling by the time I reached the end. I’ll share my emotional journey with this week’s Orville.

As usual, this review will not be a blow-by-blow recap of the episode, but rather, a breakdown of what made the episode tick. Needless to say, spoilers follow.

Another Time Travel Episode

I knew from the title that this was going to be a time travel episode. As a fan of Star Trek Voyager, I have seen my fair share of time travel stories, perhaps too many. So going to this episode, they needed to execute it really well to please me. I was (and still am) a little “meh” on the science behind this week’s incident, but when I discovered that a version of Kelly from the past was brought about the ship, I was not very interested. The episode quickly felt like Voyager’s finale, “Endgame” without the action. Kelly interacting with herself for 50 minutes was not what I wanted to see.

Kelly interacting with herself for 50 minutes was not what I wanted to see.

Another Character Study

Somewhere along the line watching the episode, my expectation changed, and I became somewhat invested in the story as another character study. The Orville has studied quite a few characters this season, but this one was particularly interesting because having a younger Kelly on the ship allows the writers to study the growth of the character in a way that would otherwise not be possible. I started to watch the younger Kelly’s interactions with the crew with greater interest and greater attention, as I juxtaposed every idiosyncrasy with the version of Kelly we know. It was becoming evident how much of a change occurred in Kelly’s character over the 7 years preceding this episode. Nowhere is this more exemplified than in younger Kelly’s interactions with Ed.

Ed sees this new Kelly as an opportunity to have his cake and eat it too. “Older Kelly”, as the crew have been calling her, doesn’t want a relationship with Ed at this stage, but Younger Kelly is open to it because she has just met him and isn’t clouded by anything that has happened, or will happen, from her perspective. (Don’t you just love talking about time travel?) This becomes one of the more interesting aspects of the episode because ultimately, Ed realizes that he can’t substitute one Kelly for the other because all the experiences of the past 7 years, both the good and the bad, have shaped her into the person he is in love with. The Younger Kelly may be genetically the same person, but in personality, she is not, not anymore. This was made abundantly clear to Ed in the party scene. Yaphit, Bortus and Klyden gave me some of the best laughs I’ve had all season, but the crux of the scene was that Ed just couldn’t keep up with Younger Kelly, and just couldn’t appreciate that life any longer.

Ed realizes that he can’t substitute one Kelly for the other.

This is what makes the episode so powerful. When I started to watch it, not as another time travel episode, but as another character study, it hit me hard because it made my introspect. There’s a moment where Younger Kelly lists the 3 most major accomplishments she wanted to achieve and tells Older Kelly that she is a disappointment. If I be honest, I think Younger me would find older me a disappointment as well, so I could understand what Older Kelly was experiencing in that moment. But ultimately, that was not a fair assessment because if we accept that based on the different experiences, older you is not the same person as younger you, that means that some of the things you deemed as important accomplishments would have to change over time with your personality.

Not Just Another Episode

One of the interesting things about this episode is that it is very unassuming. I quickly realized the episode was intended to be a Character Study, but that didn’t didn’t prevent them from delivering a mini-comedy in there with that party scene.









It also didn’t prevent them from delivering a mini-thriller in there with the Kaylon chase scene.

The Kaylon chase scene was a mini-thriller.

I may have been upset about the science behind the time travel, but it was a definite treat to see The Orville hide among the ice chunks of a planetary ring. I’m into astronomy so I love to see such things visualized so seeing The Orville emulate a ring chunk piqued my sci-fi interest and the science was pretty sound for the most part.

Seeing The Orville emulate a ring chunk piqued my sci-fi interest.

The Turning Point

Throughout the entire episode, I was quarreling about the time travel logic.

I was upset when Ed decided to give her the rundown of everything that happened over the last 7 years… correction, I am STILL upset because that was irresponsible!

I am STILL upset about this scene.

However, my major bone of contention was that if younger Kelly was in the future there is no way no for the future not to be impacted. When the prospect of a memory-wipe surfaced, and the revelation that reason her presence hadn’t thus far affected the future is because the memory wipe will work (or had worked… I don’t even know anymore), that saved the whole episode for me. I needed the logic of the premise to be, well, logical, and up to that point, it wasn’t. When that explanation was presented, my entire opinion of the episode changed. I had enjoyed it up to that point as simply a Character Study episode, but suddenly, I was also enjoying it as a Time Travel episode, so it all came together for me.

The cliffhanger was just the icing on the cake. I knew the season finale was supposed to be dealing with ramifications of a previous episode but up until the point of the cliffhanger, the entire episode played out like a standalone piece. They could literally have ended the episode before the cliffhanger and it would have been perfect, but throwing it in there just gives me more hype for the season finale now, and puts the episode into another category in my mind.

They could literally have ended the episode before the cliffhanger and it would have been perfect.

Conclusion

So, as I said, this an interesting journey for me, because I felt very let down by the scientific premise of the episode but by the end, the writers redeemed that aspect of the story and caused me to feel totally different about that I had just watched. It’s very satisfying when a story “comes together” at the end in that way. I’m still upset about Ed’s recklessness in sharing the future with a past version of his First Officer, but I enjoyed the episode otherwise, thought it was well writing, well executed and I will watch it again for sure.

Side Notes:

It was cool to see Isaac interacting with the crew like normal, and with Claire in the end.

Adrianne Palicki did a pretty good job making the two Kelly’s distinct.

This was the first episode to feature a truncated version of the Title Sequence.

Talla’s relationship with Younger Kelly was really cute to watch.

Ed and Gordon’s video game was a nice touch. Simulators are great but it’s nice to see this type of experience survived in some form.

John has been somewhat neglected this season.

Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world

A candidate for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, is a critic of LGBT+ inclusive education programmes.

Alka Sehgal Cuthbert was selected as a candidate for the single-issue Brexit Party, which was formed by ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage to stand candidates in the May 23 European Parliament election after a delay to Brexit.

Polling suggests the Brexit Party could be set to win dozens of seats in the European Parliament, but the party lists no official policies beyond pursuing Brexit and its candidates’ views have had little scrutiny.

Brexit Party candidate Alka Sehgal Cuthbert criticised inclusive education

In a 2017 column for right-wing website Spiked, Cuthbert, a part-time English teacher and educational consultant, slammed education watchdog Ofsted for “forcing a religious school to include homosexuality in the curriculum.”

Cuthbert also criticised the LGBT+ inclusive No Outsiders programme run at schools in Birmingham, writing: “Educators are behaving like indoctrinators, and pushing an anti-Enlightenment, particularist line.

“Rather than promoting inclusivity, this fetishisation of diversity actually reifies personal difference.

“Teaching kids to be careful about protected characteristics or supposedly vulnerable social groups is anti-universal – it encourages kids to see their peers as different to them on the basis of gender, race or sexuality.”

EU elections candidate questioned prevalence of homophobic bullying in schools

Cuthbert penned another Spiked column on No Outsiders in February 2019, in which she questioned how prevalent homophobic bullying is in schools.

The candidate wrote: “What incidents of homophobic or transgender bullying have occurred that merit such a curricular intervention? What horrors have occurred that would warrant teachers explicitly teaching primary school-aged children about homosexual relationships and transgender identity?

“Do they have evidence that, without programmes like No Outsiders, children would be full of hate, tearing into anyone who was different to themselves?”

Addressing protests against inclusive education at Birmingham’s Parkfield primary school, she wrote: “It seems to me that these parents know very well what the school is trying to do: teach their children to regard homosexual relationships as the moral equivalent of heterosexual relationships.

“The parents just do not agree with the school.”

She wrote: “It seems councillor Idrees [a local councillor who initially supported the protesters] encountered the limits of tolerance set by those who claim to be tolerant.

“I have some sympathy. At the Festival of Education in 2017 I was met with gasping, eyeballing, tut-tutting when, at Andrew Moffat’s presentation on No Outsiders, I argued that children should read books with great literary qualities, rather than books whose sole merit is that they represent gay and transgender people.”

The Brexit Party did not respond to a request for comment from PinkNews.

It is not the first time a party associated with Nigel Farage has faced questions over its candidates’ views on LGBT+ rights.

As leader of the UK Independence Party until 2016, Farage was forced to suspend dozens of candidates for homophobic comments, though in many cases the party was accused of failing to act.
In 2016 the most frequent objection to Bernie Sanders’s candidacy from leading Democrats arguably concerned his electability. Sanders, proclaimed an army of insiders, pundits, and party apparatchiks, simply couldn’t win a general election against Donald Trump or any other would-be Republican nominee — especially compared to the eminently electable Hillary Clinton. Proponents of this narrative tended to dismiss a great deal of evidence to the contrary: from the size, energy, and dynamism of Sanders’s crowds to the deluge of opinion polls suggesting that there was a very real possibility Clinton might lose to several of the GOP’s prospective nominees and that Sanders could win.

However party elites may have felt about Sanders’s chances in 2016, his momentum ahead of 2020 is fast becoming impossible for them to deny. Earlier this week, an Emerson College poll showed him leading all other Democratic candidates, with most trailing far behind. A more important measure, however, is probably his fundraising returns — which not only outstrip his rivals’ but include a huge number of small donations from a much larger pool of contributors. Sanders’s adeptness at taking his message to hostile territory, evidenced by a successful appearance at a Fox News town hall event this week, only adds to the overall impression.

In a different political cosmos, Democratic insiders might be overjoyed to see a popular frontrunner generate so much enthusiasm so early in the race. Recent reporting from the New York Times, however, suggests party elites are already plotting against Sanders, complete with secretive dinners featuring players from throughout the Democratic establishment and the donor class:

The matter of What To Do About Bernie and the larger imperative of party unity has, for example, hovered over a series of previously undisclosed Democratic dinners in New York and Washington organized by the longtime party financier Bernard Schwartz. The gatherings have included scores from the moderate or center-left wing of the party, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader; former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., himself a presidential candidate; and the president of the Center for American Progress, Neera Tanden.

The report, a near-perfect distillation of Democratic insider culture and elitism at their very worst, suggests the party’s corporate-friendly faction fears a repeat of what Republican apparatchiks experienced in 2016:

From canapé-filled fund-raisers on the coasts to the cloakrooms of Washington, mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by Mr. Sanders, in a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016.

Nowhere in the aggrieved musings do any of the figures quoted seem to have asked themselves why Vermont senator’s message is catching on. The fact is, it’s hard to imagine a better illustration of Sanders’s diagnosis of American politics than party elites and donors meeting at secret dinners with the explicit aim of tilting the primaries in their favor before a single vote has been cast.

The report gives the distinct impression party insiders’ main objective has more to do with maintaining control of the Democratic Party and keeping its policy agenda as nonthreatening to business interests as possible than it does with removing Donald Trump from office. The outcome big donors and party elites fear most of all, it seems, is a populist candidate defeating the familiar cavalcade of conventional, corporate-friendly politicians and going on to win the presidency.

From health insurance giants to defense contractors to tech monopolies, the Democratic Party has long embraced corporate America and the rigged policy agenda its oligarchs demand. Bernie Sanders’s momentum represents a threat to their way of doing politics. Powerful actors invested in the status quo are right to be afraid: afraid, that is, that he’ll win.
A Câmara Municipal de Torres Vedras quer integrar as linhas de Torres Vedras na lista de Património Mundial da Organização das Nações Unidas para a Educação, a Ciência e a Cultura (UNESCO). O município, conhecido por ter o “Carnaval mais português de Portugal”, vai considera que este é um dos ativos da região, que deve ser reconhecido a nível mundial por ser “uma das mais impressionantes e eficazes obras defensivas de todos os tempos”.

A decisão foi tomada por unanimidade esta terça-feira na reunião da Câmara de Torres Vedras e surge depois de o Conselho de Ministros ter classificado, em março, as linhas de Torres Vedras como Monumento Nacional. A autarquia de Torres Vedras vai propor agora à Rota Histórica das Linhas de Torres – Associação para o Desenvolvimento Turístico e Patrimonial das Linhas de Torres Vedras a elaboração da candidatura para que o momento possa ser reconhecido a nível mundial.

Este era um dos sonhos do autarca de Torres Vedras, Carlos Bernardes, que, pouco depois de ter visto as linhas de Torres Vedras serem reconhecidas como Monumento Nacional, afirmava que o maior desejo era de que as linhas que foram construídas para defender o país da terceira invasão Napoleónica fossem reconhecidas também a nível mundial.

Segundo a câmara este conjunto fortificado é “um dos grandes empreendimentos da nossa história contemporânea e uma das mais impressionantes e eficazes obras defensivas de todos os tempos”.

Uma cidade além do Carnaval

Ao Jornal Económico, Carlos Bernardes diz que, em Torres Vedras, “a diversidade é imensa”. “Das primeiras medidas que tomei, enquanto presidente da Câmara foi desenvolver um plano estratégico de desenvolvimento sustentável para o turismo. Foi um documento que teve como base um modelo participativo, onde os agentes do setor e os cidadãos tiveram a oportunidade de participar”.

O autarca conta que, face à diversidade da oferta que o território proporciona aos turistas, foram definidos eixos estratégicos: eixo do turismo-natureza, o da gastronomia e vinhos e do património cultural. “A ideia é sermos diferenciadores em cada uma delas”, afirma Carlos Bernardes.

Um dos maiores ativos da cidade é o Carnaval. “O Carnaval é o principal evento de Torres Vedras e também, ao dia de hoje, é um dos principais eventos que se realizam no nosso país. O Carnaval é a época baixa, no conceito de turismo, mas em Torres Vedras é época alta”, refere o presidente.

Um estudo do Instituto Politécnico de Leiria, realizado em 2015, mostra que o Carnaval tem um impacto de cerca de 9 milhões de euros a nível local de Torres Vedras, que vão “desde a venda de um simples botão até à construção do ‘monumento Carnaval’, que é a peça onde há mais investimento”. O autarca diz ainda que o Carnaval tem um forte impacto na área da restauração e alojamento, com praticamente todos os espaços de alojamento a esgotarem durante os dias de comemorações.

Mas Carlos Bernardes que a atração turística da cidade vai além do Carnaval. O ano passado, Torres Vedras, em conjunto com Alenquer, foi nomeada “cidade europeia do vinho”. O autarca diz que a distinção permitiu à cidade promover o seu território além-fronteiras e reforçar a aposta na enoturismo e na gastronomia.

“Tivemos a oportunidade de estar num conjunto significativo de eventos e iniciativas ao longo do ano que revelaram o potencial dos vinhos de Torres Vedras e Alenquer, onde a tradição e a contemporaneidade se fundem. Diria que foi o princípio de tudo. Estão reunidas todas as condições para Torres Vedras e Alenquer, às portas de Lisboa, se poderem afirmar numa área que é importante e que os nossos produtos já estão a sentir isso”, afirma.

Ao Carnaval e aos vinhos, soma-se o surf. “Torres Vedras tem vindo a afirmar um evento que é o Ocean Spirit, que tem como visão e matriz identitária a projeção das várias modalidades dos desportos de onda e que ao longo do tempo tem vindo a reforçar o posicionamento do nosso território, que tem 20 km de costa, 12 bandeiras azuis”, explica Carlos Bernardes, acrescentando que Torres Vedras é também reconhecida pelo galardão Green Destination e Quality Coast, que visam a promoção de destinos turísticos sustentáveis.

“As pessoas procuram cada vez mais a diferenciação, na qual Torres Vedras se destaca”, garante. Recentemente, a cidade foi distinguida como um dos 25 destinos mais atrativos do país.
An Ottawa landscaper who covered his tracks and hid from police after a deadly hit-and-run has been spared jail time by a judge who accepted his explanation that a fear of turning himself in was heightened because he’s a “man of colour” afraid of racist police.

In 2015, Andy Nevin, 39, was cycling along Leitrim Road when Deinsberg St-Hilaire’s pickup truck smashed into him. St-Hilaire was found not guilty of dangerous driving causing death in 2018, but pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.

During his trial, court heard that St-Hilaire went to substantive lengths to hide his involvement in Nevin’s death.

The maximum penalty for obstruction of justice is two years in prison, but Ontario Superior Court Justice Catherine Aitken instead sentenced St-Hilaire to 100 hours of community service. In the conditional sentence, delivered Wednesday, the judge also gave St-Hilaire a curfew of 10 p.m. for one year, unless it’s snowing. (She wanted to accommodate his winter snow plow job.)

The judge noted that St-Hilaire’s fear of racist police was connected to past traffic stops where he said he’d been treated unfairly.

Though the Ottawa police don’t normally comment on rulings, Chief Charles Bordeleau issued a rare statement on Wednesday: “It’s unfortunate that these comments were made putting into question the professionalism of our members during this difficult investigation.”

While the judge said St-Hilaire’s fears didn’t justify his callous actions in covering his tracks, she accepted it was genuine — just like his “deep remorse and shame” for killing Nevin.

But the judge also said St-Hilaire failed to do the right thing after hitting Nevin and showed a blatant lack of respect for Nevin’s grieving family.

“His silence and efforts to conceal (the crime) only added to the hurt” of the family, the judge said.

St-Hilaire never stopped his vehicle after striking Nevin, who was thrown some 60 feet off his bike and into the ditch where he was left to die alone on June 28, 2015. The judge accepted St-Hilaire’s story during trial that he fell asleep at the wheel only to be awoken by a loud bang. He kept on driving when he checked the rear-view mirror and saw nothing amiss.

He was doing 80 kilometres an hour in a 50-kilometre zone. It was 5:55 a.m. and he was returning from a wedding after-party. He testified he’d only had one glass of wine the entire night. It was his brother’s wedding and he was the best man. St-Hilaire got behind the wheel of a F-250 Ford pickup after being awake for 22 hours.

When Justice Aitken delivered her not guilty verdict, she called it a circumstantial case, and said the Crown fell short of proving St-Hilaire’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

And when the judge announced on Wednesday that she would spare St-Hilaire a jail sentence, Kerry Nevin, Andy’s father, walked out of court in disgust. He said his son deserved better.

“There is no justice for Andy. I understand vigilantism these days because the justice system doesn’t work. This whole process has been madness. It’s been insanity from the beginning,” he said.

The days following Nevin’s death were long and horrible for his family. While they were making funeral plans, court heard how St-Hilaire was covering his tracks in a most calculated way.

He tarped the truck that was all over the news, had it repaired and took it to the car wash. He also went into hiding and checked in at a motel out by the airport.

Ottawa police detectives worked the case around the clock and had St-Hilaire under surveillance before arresting him nine days after the hit-and-run.

Those days were hard on the Nevin family, who said they wished St-Hilaire had owned up to what had happened.

At a sentencing hearing earlier this year, they described St-Hilaire as a “heartless monster” and asked how he sleeps at night.

Assistant Crown Attorney Lisa Miles called St-Hilaire’s actions a shameful act. The prosecutor told the judge during the sentencing hearing that St-Hilaire should have taken responsibility and reminded the court that Nevin’s death and the trial has left his family broken. Miles also noted that St-Hilaire’s regret and remorse was plentiful long after the fact. She said everyone has a certain responsibility and that St-Hilaire had failed in his, choosing instead to hide his involvement. “It’s not who we are as a community,” Miles said.

Throughout the trial, court proceedings have been tense — and things were no different Wednesday. As the judge summarized glowing reference letters about the convicted man, saying he was kind-hearted and generous, Nevin’s father, seated in the court gallery, shouted back that he was also a “killer.”

The grieving Nevin family said they felt the judge spent too much time painting a sympathetic portrait of the man who killed their son, instead of talking about him. The judge outlined how St-Hilaire went to church, and had endured racism and bullying in the schoolyard growing up because he was a poor black immigrant.

Karamoko Dembele's meteoric rise hit another landmark on Thursday when he was handed the captain's armband by England U16s.

The Celtic prodigy led the Three Lions out before adding his name to the scoresheet in a 5-0 thumping of the Ivory Coast.

Dembele , who turned 16 earlier this year, has yet to commit his international future having turned out for Scotland and England at youth level.

And Scottish youth coaches will be hoping the honour of leading out the Auld Enemy won't away him when it comes to making a decision.

Ironically, Dembele's parents were born in the Ivory Coast, meaning he is eligible to play for Les Elephants too.

Celtic made sure they got Dembele tied down long term back in December when they handed the Glasgow school kid his first professional contract.

He has since become a regular for the Hoops' reserves and has been tipped to make his first appearance in a top team squad in the near future.

Dembele burst onto the scene as a 13-year-old when he featured for Celtic U20s.

He is is fast becoming Scottish football's hottest young property.
Google this week announced that it is going to block login attempts from embedded browser frameworks to prevent man-in-the-middle (MiTM) phishing attacks.

Phishing attacks carried out by injecting malicious content in legitimate traffic are difficult to detect when attackers use an embedded browser framework or any other automated tool for authentication.

For example, the embedded browser framework Google offers Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) that allows embedding Chromium-based browsers in other applications.

Google announced that starting from June, it will block sign-ins from these frameworks.

“However, one form of phishing, known as “man in the middle” (MITM), is hard to detect when an embedded browser framework (e.g., Chromium Embedded Framework – CEF) or another automation platform is being used for authentication. MITM intercepts the communications between a user and Google in real-time to gather the user’s credentials (including the second factor in some cases) and sign in.” reads a blog post published by Google. “Because we can’t differentiate between a legitimate sign in and a MITM attack on these platforms, we will be blocking sign-ins from embedded browser frameworks starting in June. This is similar to the restriction on webview sign-ins announced in April 2016.”

Google suggests developers currently using CEF for authentication to switch to the browser-based OAuth authentication.

The browser-based OAuth authentication also allows users to see the full URL of the page where they are entering their credentials, this could help them to avoid phishing websites mimicking legit ones.

“The solution for developers currently using CEF for authentication is the same: browser-based OAuth authentication. Aside from being secure, it also enables users to see the full URL of the page where they are entering their credentials, reinforcing good anti-phishing practices,” continues Google.

“If you are a developer with an app that requires access to Google Account data, switch to using browser -based OAuth authentication today.”

Weeknights during prime time on AMC, you can catch Story Notes — real time trivia and facts about your favorite movies! Below is the online version of the Story Notes for Demolition Man.

Automotive Notes

GM loaned $69 million worth of concept cars to the movie. One is a replica of GM’s Ultralite 100-miles-per-gallon concept car.

GM had only one of the Ultralite cars, so Warner Bros. hired a crew to build 11 more.

The 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham was the first car with electronic memory seats. The car could remember the driver’s seat settings and adjust accordingly.

One car is a 1989 Cadillac Solitaire concept car. Instead of rearview mirrors, it has video cameras.

Google is developing a self-driving car that could be on the road by 2017. Some states, including California, have already passed legislation to regulate the vehicles.

The 442 car model is considered one of the sportiest Oldsmobiles in history. The other car they considered for the movie was the Pontiac GTO.

Award Note

Wesley Snipes was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain (1994).

Pancho Villa was a Mexican revolutionary, known for fighting for the poor.

Like John Spartan, the ancient Spartan warriors were known for their indifference to pain.

Location Notes

They shot outdoor scenes in business complexes to make the future seem bland.

Huxley’s apartment building is really the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood.

The Pacific Design Center is nicknamed “The Blue Whale” because of its cobalt-blue glass.

The freezing technique was borrowed from Cat’s Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut. The filmmakers used a lot of futuristic novels as references for the movie.

HAL was the name of the computer in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Simon Phoenix’s blonde hair is the reason NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman started dying his hair. Rodman liked the movie so much, he saw it two nights in a row.

Stallone had duplicates of the frozen John Spartan put on display at Planet Hollywood restaurants. He was one of the original investors in the restaurant chain.

San Angeles was going to be the name of the city in Blade Runner (1982).

Several websites claim to have figured out how to use the three seashells.

Prop Note

The sex simulator was designed to look elegant, like something you stored in a jewelry box.

Quotation Notes

Stallone on the cryogenic freezing scene: “[That] was probably the worst five hours I’ve ever had on movie sets… I was terrified.”

Director Marco Brambilla: “Even though everything seems to be perfect and beautiful and placid… it’s boring as hell.”

Brambilla: “Wesley at first actually didn’t want to do the movie.” Brambilla said producer Silver “won’t take no for an answer.

Brambilla says Wesley Snipes has a “manic energy” and was always moving on set.

Sandra Bullock says she considered Stallone her big brother on set.

Director Marco Brambilla: “I wanted Phoenix to always have the upper hand each time they meet.”

Script Note

Denis Leary’s part was rewritten after he was cast. They wanted to let him rant.

Set Notes

The opening set was inspired by the L.A. riots that happened just six months before filming began.

The Department of Water and Power building in L.A. — which was already scheduled for destruction — was blown up for the movie.

The lifecast of Stallone was created by the effects team from Jumanji (1995).

During rehearsals, Wesley Snipes starting reciting his lines in Spanish and they thought it was funny.

Snipes moved so quickly during fight scenes, they had to ask him to slow down so the audience could follow the action.

They originally planned to have Snipes and Stallone meet face-to-face without a fight… but then decided it would be much better if they tried to kill each other.

The fight scenes in Demolition Man were all choreographed to be somewhat cartoonish. The violence was meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek.

Taco Bell was the only restaurant that agreed to be shown in the R-rated Demolition Man.

The giant fireplace made the set about 105-110 degrees Fahrenheit.

Spartan’s apartment was inspired by contemporary Japanese architecture.

Source Note

Update: A previous version of this study looked only at the 18 hours of regular daily programming from 11:00 a.m EDT on April 18 to the same time the following day, thus excluding any coverage that took place between midnight and 6:00 a.m. EDT Friday morning. The new total includes all 24 hours of coverage.

Although the Mueller report did not recommend any charges against the President, liberal journalists on cable and broadcast networks spent Thursday suggesting to audiences that impeachment was imminent, if not inevitable. Throughout Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, liberal talking heads on cable and broadcast news networks mentioned impeachment an astonishing 309 times during their coverage the of the newly-released Mueller report.

MRC analysts examined a 24-hour span of coverage on liberal cable (CNN, MSNBC) and broadcast (ABC, CBS, NBC) networks, from 11:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday to the same time the following day, for every instance where the term “impeachment” — or some permutation thereof — was used by hosts, analysts, or contributors. In total, the word came up 363 times, with the vast majority (336) coming from cable networks CNN (198) and MSNBC (138).

Those numbers did not include cases in which the term was uttered by politicians or other explicitly partisan actors, such as Trump attorney Jay Sekulow.

Watch the video below for a sample of the media's impeachment obsession:

CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell were particularly keen on discussing the prospect of impeachment. The term appeared a whopping 34 times during the one-hour The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell. Interestingly, journalists also mentioned impeachment 34 times on Blitzer’s The Situation Room, but over the course of two hours, between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. EDT.

By the early afternoon, numerous pundits had begun referring to the Mueller report as “a road map for impeachment.” CNN’s Dana Bash used that catch phrase twice during the 12:00 p.m. EDT hour: “What he did here, as Pamela just laid out, is a road map, a ten-episode road map for really serious consideration for impeachment.” Hours later, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes opened his show with the same terminology.

During MSNBC’s live coverage following Attorney General William Barr’s Thursday press briefing, co-host Nicolle Wallace was hopeful that congressional Democrats would reconsider the possibility of impeaching the President: “This conduct is as sort of impeachable-looking, if you put it in a time capsule, as Nixon’s conduct.” Wallace later repeatedly asked Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell (CA) about the likelihood of the House beginning the impeachment process.

That evening on MSNBC, Hardball host Chris Matthews was similarly eager for proceedings to start:

Congress has got to decide if they think impeachment is the right thing to do, and then think about the politics. If they think of the politics first, they’re probably not going to do it, and Trump’s gonna walk.

For their part, congressional Democrats did not appear keen on discussing impeachment. The closest any member of that party came to actually endorsing the idea on Thursday was when House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler was asked about the option during a press conference: “That’s one possibility. There are others.”

Yet journalists were not discouraged by the Democrats’ reticence to discuss removing the President from office. Given the media’s obsession with impeachment — even after Mueller found no collusion and declined to prosecute on obstruction — one has to wonder whether they’re even reading the same report as the rest of us.
Marijuana legalization is a winning issue in the 2020 presidential election. While Idaho police crack down on hemp, stores continue to sell it. Black market marijuana sellers say their businesses will survive legalization in New Jersey. Also: Facebook considers allowing cannabis sellers to post (but not advertise) on the platform. 🌳

Cannabis in the 2020 race. Former U.S. rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) called for federal marijuana legalization ahead of an expected bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. CNN Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) reiterated his support for marijuana reform, criticizing prohibition for destroying lives. Politico The former governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper is also jumping into the race. Hickenlooper, once opposed to legalization, oversaw the implementation of legal cannabis and eventually came to defend the marijuana program in his state. Reuters “Unless Democrats get a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate or win over Republicans, chances are the next president in 2021 is not going to legalize marijuana nationwide. But the candidates’ support for legalization marks a huge shift from previous presidential bids.” Vox

The strange status of hemp. Idaho police are pursuing a case against a shipment of industrial hemp that they argue is actually marijuana. But prosecutors say that — even if the plant material contains less than 0.3 percent THC — the hemp would still violate state drug laws. At the same time, there are tons of stores in the state that sell hemp products and have never run into trouble with the law. “So it’s OK to buy and eat hemp products in Idaho, but you can’t drive it through the state — even after the 2018 farm bill removed it from the list of controlled substances and legalized commercial production?” The conflict between state and federal laws on hemp plus the lack of enforcement shows how — even after the 2018 Farm Bill — the hemp industry still operates with legal uncertainties. Idaho Statesman

A rift in the GOP over marijuana policy. A rift in New Mexico’s Republican Party mirrors a conflict on the national level, too: The state GOP chairman announced that the party does not support bills that legalize adult-use marijuana. But GOP lawmakers are sponsoring marijuana legalization bills currently in the state legislature. Three Republican senators are working across the aisle on a bill that would tax and regulate recreational cannabis. “I think unless you live under a rock, you know legalized marijuana is coming,” said one. The push for legalization came after a Democrat was elected governor. Albuquerque Journal

The marijuana black market is flourishing in N.J. While lawmakers and lobbyists spar over marijuana legalization, business is booming for black market cannabis. At a pop-up event for cannabis sellers, one entrepreneur talked about her dream to open a cannabis bakery, but the costs of entering a legal market were simply too high. She believes she will always have customers on the black market: “The state has no idea what they’re doing. They have no idea what the people want… The underground will always stay in business.” Asbury Park Press Related: Spending on marijuana lobbying in the state reached $1.3 million last year, a 313 percent increase from the year before. The Associated Press The state Senate’s GOP leader says he’s not whipping votes against marijuana legalization. New Jersey Globe

Fighting over medical marijuana leads to delays for patients. The agriculture department of Louisiana is accusing Louisiana State University and its cannabis growing partner GB Sciences for improperly moving marijuana plants and breaking state law. LSU, for its part, says the state agency is overstepping its authority by proposing conditions for moving the plants. “Ongoing disagreements over the regulatory process have delayed medical marijuana from reaching pharmacy shelves, years after lawmakers legalized it for certain treatments. It is still not clear when the product will reach the pharmacy shelves.” The Advocate

Facebook considers relaxing marijuana rules. During an internal presentation at a moderation policy forum, Facebook considered “whether we can loosen this restriction [on marijuana sales], especially in relation to medical marijuana, legal marijuana and brick and mortar stores.” The proposed changes would only apply to Facebook posts, not advertisements. Cannabis businesses have long been critical of the social network’s approach to enforcing its own policies on cannabis content. “No formal recommendation has been made, but the company has formed an internal working group to determine how the rules could be changed and whether looser rules could realistically be enforced across a patchwork of different laws.” The Telegraph

California and Arizona cannabis businesses head to court over shared name. Two cannabis companies named “Harvest” are heading to court over the name. The California-based company has a state trademark for the name, while the Arizona-based business has the federal trademark for the name. The Arizona company registered the federal trademark before the California company registered its state trademark. While the Arizona company has previously sued the California company over the name, the legal battle is heating up as the Arizona company prepares to enter the California market. “A similar dispute also is unfolding in Northern California, where a hemp clothing maker and cannabis farmer is suing a well-known [marijuana] manufacturer over the name ‘Satori.'” Marijuana Business Daily

Elsewhere in cannabis business news… The legal cannabis industry in the U.S. has created 211,000 full-time jobs so far. Leafly Farmers and ranchers in the U.S. are increasingly accepting of cannabis as a crop. While they tend to be more conservative, the increase in acceptance reflects the nation’s changing attitudes — especially when it comes to CBD and medical marijuana. Marijuana Business Daily Tim Leslie has joined Leafly as its CEO. He was previously the VP of Amazon Prime Video International. GeekWire Maine decided to withdraw its contract with Metrc for its seed-to-sale tracking system. It will release a request for proposals instead. “The state is concerned the deal could draw a challenge that results in a delay of recreational marijuana sales.” Marijuana Business Daily

Cannabis in Canada. The amount of cannabis seized at the Canadian border has increased more than 60 percent year-over-year after the country legalized the drug. “The Canada Border Services Agency is linking the rise to the fact it began asking people last fall whether they were bringing cannabis into the country.” Financial Post Manitoba police raided an alleged unlicensed cannabis dispensary in Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation. CBC News B.C. cannabis producer Ascent was granted creditor protection after its cannabis licenses were suspended by federal regulators. BNN Bloomberg Cannabis producer Cronos sold its 19 percent stake in Whistler Medical Marijuana to Aurora Cannabis. Business Insider
US authorities are warning wannabe vigilantes against taking the law into their own hands after an armed militia group detained over 300 migrants earlier this week at the Mexican border in what they claimed was a citizen’s arrest.

“These individuals should not attempt to exercise authority reserved for law enforcement,” New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas said in response to reports that members of the United Constitutional Patriots militia – which claims to be made up of ex-cops and veterans – had captured a massive group of illegal immigrants after they entered the US through a fence near the town of Sunland, New Mexico earlier this week.

An armed militia is rounding up immigrants in New Mexico and beyond the obvious implications I fear for every visibily latino individual who might encounter a group of this nature. The manhunt for these assholes should be national. pic.twitter.com/ghWZ7WqR93 — nikki mccann ramírez (@NikkiMcR) April 18, 2019

The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to state government denouncing the militia for “undermin[ing] the legitimate efforts of our state’s law enforcement officials to keep New Mexico families safe.”

We cannot allow racist and armed vigilantes to kidnap and detain people seeking asylum.

UCP member Jim Benvie disagrees with this characterization, claiming the members on Monday night’s patrol merely gave a “verbal order of arrest” to the migrants, who sat and kneeled in place until the Border Patrol arrived.

We can’t make them stay if they don’t want to.

He told the New York Times that group members were specifically told not to point their guns at any of the migrants. He says the group has to be heavily armed because their mission interferes with the cartels’ human trafficking operations, and claims militiamen even offered the migrants $20 to rat out the smugglers who helped them across the border – but no one took the offer.

A video of the mass arrest shows hundreds of migrants sitting and kneeling complacently as the camerawoman marvels at how many children and sick people are coming in “right through our backdoor.” “I don’t know what to say about this, other than the fact that it’s gotta stop,” she says. The lengthy clip, which was streamed live over Facebook, shows the Border Patrol arrive and walk the massive group through the desert. The militiamen appear to be on good terms with the Border Patrol officers.

US Customs and Border Protection wouldn’t comment on the group specifically, but admonished would-be heroes to call 911 instead of taking matters into their own hands if they suspected illegal activity.

Interference by civilians in law enforcement matters could have public safety and legal consequences for all parties involved.

Despite the official disapproval, the UCP sees its role as a helpful one. “We’re people that care about our strained Border Patrol,” Benvie said. The group’s leader, who calls himself Johnny Horton Jr., claims they have detained over 3,500 migrants in the last month alone, while Benvie says the Border Patrol has never told them to stand down. They plan to continue the patrols until President Trump builds his long-anticipated border wall.

“Sei bella quando spandi amore e dici al mondo non sono una statua, sono qualcuno”.

La frase è del il cantautore Roberto Vecchioni (presidente onorario di Progetto Scuola) a commento della presentazione della ricerca Beauty Confidence e Autostima, sull’autostima di donne e adolescenti in Italia. Autostima che non è propriamente il nostro forte, se si considera che i risultati hanno evidenziato come 4 donne e ragazze su 10 non si sentono belle, 5 su 10 pensano di non poter sbagliare o mostrare le loro debolezze, 5 su 10 sentono la competizione con i familiari e gli amici. Ben 7 su 10 poi non hanno “un’alta opinione” del proprio corpo, e quindi tendono a saltare i pasti (7 ragazze su 10 e 4 donne su 10), a non partecipare ad eventi sociali. Non solo. Hanno difficoltà a sostenere le proprie opinioni e anche a sottoporsi a controlli medici (8 su 10).

Insomma, un quadro certo non confortante per le donne italiane, che si attestano al penultimo posto per autostima nel panel di 17 Paesi in cui finora la ricerca è stata condotta da Edelman Intelligence per Dove (Unilever). Siamo più fiduciose in noi stesse solo rispetto alle giapponesi, fanalino di coda a livello mondiale. Che tutto questo sia la conseguenza una società giudicante, orientata alla performance, a modelli non realistici e al costante confronto, che ha impatti fortemente negativi sulla relazione che le ragazze e le donne hanno con il proprio corpo? Di certo emerge come un declino importante del livello di soddisfazione e di felicità si registri con l’ingresso nell’adolescenza: dai 14 ai 17 anni c’è un calo di 16 punti percentuali (dal 21% in età compresa tra i 10 e i 13 anni al 9%).

Eppure qui non si tratta solo di immagine. E’ dimostrato, infatti, che quando invece le donne e le ragazze hanno fiducia nel proprio corpo e se ne prendono cura sono più forti e centrate: il 78% tende a vedere il lato positivo di ciò che accade, il 61% non si preoccupa del problema e pensa subito alla soluzione, il 52% sente di poter raggiungere i propri obiettivi o si sente inarrestabile, il 67% sente di poter decidere in autonomia della propria vita.

L’IMMAGINE SOSTENIBILE

Per far sì che questo diventi l’atteggiamento della maggioranza e non della minoranza delle ragazze e delle donne, bisogna quindi coltivare un concetto di immagine sostenibile. Sostenibile nel rapporto con se stesse e con il mondo esterno, sostenibile nel messaggio che le aziende e i media veicolano al pubblico femminile (e non solo), sostenibile nella velocità con cui fruiamo dei social, che al momento non ci motiva ad approfondire e capire chi sono le persone che vediamo, al di là della loro immagine.

Fondamentali per supportare le ragazze e le donne nel modo corretto di porsi le domande in tema di bellezza e di autostima sono quindi consapevolezza ed empowerment. Consapevolezza sulla percezione di sé e del proprio valore (che può arrivare attraverso campagne di sensibilizzazione partendo dalle scuole, per educare all’essere se stessi in modo sano e solido fin dall’adolescenza).

Consapevolezza che la bellezza non è un canone fisso bensì un modo di esprimersi in modo positivo ‘anche’ attraverso il proprio aspetto. La bellezza autentica, che ci rende forti e sicure, è fatta di cura di sé, di sorrisi e spontaneità, di imperfezioni e qualità, di energia che si emana. Valorizzarsi e crederci, per rendersi uniche e non confrontabili.

Empowerment, per mettere in atto ogni giorno l’atteggiamento positivo che abbiamo verso noi se stesse come persone, in modo profondo, e la convinzione che possiamo essere uniche e portare valore a noi stesse ed alla società proprio per ciò che siamo e per ciò che facciamo.

ALLENARE L’AUTOSTIMA

Se per affrontare le nostre sfide quotidiane abbiamo bisogno di una salda percezione di noi stessi come individui (di tipo estetico, valoriale, di competenze), lo psicoanalista Prof. Andrea Bocchiola intervenuto alla presentazione della ricerca ci ricorda che “la considerazione di sé non è una peculiarità fissa, ma un processo che si crea con il carattere nei primi 3-4 anni di vita, e che deve essere costantemente coltivato e mantenuto.”

In questo è fondamentale l’approccio ‘in positivo’ che possono avere prima di tutto le famiglie sin dall’infanzia, gli amici, gli insegnanti, i media, fornendo strumenti di pensiero, specie per le ragazze: spargere semi di consapevolezza che si spera potranno germogliare.

IL PROGETTO PER LE SCUOLE

In attesa della campagna pubblicitaria legata a Dove Progetto Autostima, prevista per settembre 2019 su TV e digital, e parte del progetto di Beauty Confidence e Autostima avviato nel 2004 e che ha sinora raggiunto 35 milioni di giovani in 140 paesi in tutto il mondo, in Italia sono già partiti i primi workshop nelle scuole grazie alla collaborazione con Fondo Scuola, destinati agli insegnanti delle classi 4 e 5 della scuola primaria, e a tutti gli studenti della secondaria di primo grado.

Obiettivo: fornire gli strumenti necessari per affrontare in classe il tema dell’autostima, ricostruire dei valori nei ragazzi e sviluppare un pensiero critico, capire che non si può essere bravi in tutto, aiutare la loro capacità di sentirsi e relazionarsi con gli altri in modo sicuro, non autogiudicante ma più autentico. Per essere esattamente ciò che vogliono essere.

DOBBIAMO ESSERE ROLE MODEL

Tra gli intervenuti alla conferenza stampa anche le ambasciatrici ufficiali, che hanno condiviso le loro esperienze da donne ‘vere’ e dei giudizi subiti per il loro aspetto. L’attrice Katia Follesa ha trovato nell’ironia la chiave per risolvere e superare il giudizio degli altri, cercando di essere il più possibile sé stessa sia davanti al pubblico che in famiglia, anche forte della sua responsabilità come mamma,.

La blogger Camihawke ha ricordato i tempi di scuola quando veniva schernita per via del suo fianco pronunciato e dell’essere troppo alta, facendola sentire ‘non giusta’. Secondo Camihawke, bisogna cercare di “tramutare in circolo virtuoso quello che è circolo vizioso, abituando le persone alla normalità (…). Aver vissuto personalmente un disagio ti permette di aiutare meglio le altre persone a superarlo”.

Come donne ci troviamo davanti ad una doppia responsabilità: riuscire ad investire di più su noi stesse, in modo valorizzante, credibile, riconoscibile e costante (ma senza quegli stravoglimenti che ci snaturano e talvolta ci ridicolizzano), ed essere al tempo stesso dei modelli per quelle bambine e quelle ragazze (nonché figlie e nipoti) che ci guardano e che hanno bisogno di noi per non farsi catturare dal condizionamento di modelli dannosi.

PewDiePie dropped his ballistic diss on T-Series, “Congratulations”, after the Indian music giant surpassed the YouTuber in subscription numbers in late March – and the song has become an instant hit on the video hosting platform.

In the latest episode of LWIAY, Felix Kjellberg, known by his online alias PewDiePie, boasted that his “Congratulations” diss track, released on 31 March, has surpassed the eponymous song by American rapper Post Malone in “heart” count, having gained 6.1 million likes on YouTube.

By contrast, Post Malone’s music video has been liked 5.6 million times since its release on 23 January 2017 – but it’s been viewed over one billion times, while PewDiePie’s version has amassed roughly 87 million views.

Obviously, 6.1 million thumbs-up seem not to be enough for the YouTube celebrity: Pewds has now challenged his viewers to beat the hip hop artist in the views count:

“We absolutely did it. Now, if we could just hit one billion views. No problem. Easy-peasy. One billion. That’s easy!”

It remains to be seen whether Post Malone will respond to Pewds’ bold move and come up with a counterchallenge, or maybe even team up with the vlogger for Meme Review or a collab song.

Pewds’ “Congratulations” – a sarcasm-ridden diss track on his bitter rival T-Series – has been at the epicentre of a controversy in India: the Delhi High Court last week ordered to remove the song from Indian YouTube following a complaint by the music label, suggesting that the track is “abusive”, “defamatory”, and “racist in nature”.

In the scandal-hit song, the Swede is sneering at T-Series after the music and movie giant outperformed him in subscription numbers on YouTube. In a bid to spice up the race, Pewds accused T-Series of selling pirated music to its customers and tax evasion, as well as having links to the Indian mafia. The YouTuber went as far as to allude to sexual harassment allegations against the company’s CEO Bhushan Kumar dating back to October 2018.

As of 20 April, the gap between T-Series and PewDiePie had grown to over 400,000 subscribers and is generally trending in the Indian channel’s favour.

Pewds had had the most subscribed channel since 2013, but has been repeatedly dethroned by T-Series, which entered the race several months ago after seeing a massive surge in its follower base last year due to the country’s recent, expanding Wi-Fi procurement.

The film, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond, became the first major Bond blockbuster film and widely accepted as a major success point for the James Bond series. Released to positive reviews, Goldfinger became the first Bond film to win an Academy Award and has a lasting legacy on the genre.

For Margaret Nolan, her role of Dink, Bond’s masseuse, was a relatively small one somewhat insignificant in the wider plot of the film. Nolan’s impact on the film would come in Robert Brownjohn’s now iconic opening sequence, painted gold and wearing a revealing gold bikini.

Apparently, Nolan only consented to do the title sequence if she was also given a part in the movie.

“On this type of film the only themes to work with are, it seems to me, sex or violence. I chose sex,” opined Brownjohn in Sex and Typography for Herbert Spencer’s Typographica magazine.

“It does celebrate the physical form,” she added. “If I’d been nude it might have been about liberation because up to that point you wouldn’t have seen a nude woman in a publicly visible thing like that. I could have been very pretentious and said this is liberating. But because I was dressed-up anyway I didn’t get that sense.”

Designer of the sequence, Brownjohn, was later recognised for his work and won the prestigious gold pencil at the Design and Art Director Awards in 1965. Such was the racy nature of the imagery, Goldfinger also became the first film sequence to require clearance from British film censors.

The images below, some of which you probably don’t want to view while you’re at work, were taken on the set by Herbert Spencer and were exhibited at the MoMA as a part of the exhibition Goldfinger: The Design of an Iconic Film Title.

Katharine Hepburn: Leading man

How do we know Kate Hepburn was one of the greatest actors ever? Because inside her soul, she was a boy named Jimmy. Biographer Bill Mann explains.

We all know Katharine Hepburn was the woman who wore the pants. But was her iconic embodiment of the independent-spirited American woman really a carefully cultivated image that masked something else?

“I would consider ‘transgender’ a better way to understand Katharine Hepburn than anything else,” says out novelist and Hollywood historian William J. Mann. His latest biography, Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn (Henry Holt and Co., $30), explores with unprecedented frankness the star’s fluid sexuality and gender identification. Mann sheds new light on Hepburn’s complex relationships with gay or closeted bisexual men, including her legendary love, Spencer Tracy—who, Mann reveals, was at least bisexual in terms of his sexual attractions and interactions.

When Kate was excerpted in the October issue of Vanity Fair, revealing that Tracy had enjoyed the paid favors of a male gas station attendant and that Hepburn’s love life included several female lovers, a flurry of headlines screamed that Tracy and Hepburn were bisexual.

That label, according to Mann, isn’t a useful prism through which to understand either star, but it especially short-changes Hepburn. “People ask, ‘Was she bisexual? Was she lesbian?’ ” Mann says. “Those conversations aren’t helpful. The best way to understand her is to look at her relationship with her own gender and the way she never felt comfortable as a woman.”

Hepburn herself said as much during her lifetime. “She told [talk-show host] Dick Cavett, ‘I am a missing link’ between the genders,” Mann says. “She knew somehow that she wasn’t a woman the way a woman ought to be. She had a woman’s body but felt in her heart and soul that she was a man. Everyone says, ‘Oh, we already know that—she was a liberated woman who rebelled against traditional roles for women!’ But I think it went deeper.”

Mann explains: “You need to go back to her childhood and the invention of her alter ego, Jimmy [whom Hepburn created at age 10 when she decided she really was a boy]. Boys are what mattered to Dr. Hepburn,” Mann says of the star’s adored and much mythologized father. This was the standard against which Kate had to compete. “Her own gender issues—which I believe were congenital and didn’t evolve out of her rivalry with her brother—were exacerbated by this. They got stronger. She couldn’t understand why Daddy paid so much attention to Tommy and coached him in boat races and somersaults and tree climbing and not her.”

According to Mann, Why not me? I’m a boy too! was young Kate’s inner refrain. “It was as though she were saying, ‘OK, I can understand if you don’t want to let girls do that, but I’m not a girl.’ That’s why she shaved her head and called herself Jimmy.

“I remember when the light came on in my head,” Mann says of the realization that there was more to Hepburn than anyone had guessed. “Everything fell into place like dominoes. In some ways, after Tommy died, Kate became [her father’s] favorite. She grew up to be her father’s kind of man rather than her mother’s kind of woman.”

During the exhaustive research for Kate, the biographer read a copy of Hepburn’s unproduced autobiographical screenplay, written in 1987, titled Me and Phyllis. The screenplay has never been available to the public, and Mann didn’t quote it because Hepburn’s estate owns the rights.

The 2019 NFL Draft is drawing closer, and that means a few NFL franchises are about to bring in a quarterback with a first-round pick.

A total of 53 quarterbacks have been selected in the first round since 2000, and the results have varied. A team might wind up with a bust like JaMarcus Russell (No. 1 pick) or a two-time MVP like Aaron Rodgers (No. 24 overall). Five quarterbacks joined the list last year. Now, Kyler Murray, Dwayne Haskins and perhaps a few others will be grouped into the first-round QB list.
This was originally designed for a contest in which a nieghborhood association wanted a cute image of an owl made with LEGO. I went a little overboard and while they loved this, it was too much for the poster they were making. So I decided to keep it and build it myself.

This represents a Barn Owl in flight over a tree branch. The branch isn't necessarily part of the design, it's just a way to showcase the owl. The face of the owl really lent to the arch bricks, so that was the way I started. I also wanted to include the Ninjago blades in kind of the same way they're used for dragons. I ideally wanted the dark red of the face to be dark tan, but they don't come in that color.

I also thought this might go well with the bird sets that have already been released.

It's not a terribly complicated build, but it does use some SNOT techniques on the interior to get the round body.

New Delhi [India], Apr 20 (ANI): Failing to meet direct tax collections target, the Income Tax (I-T) Department has started surgical strikes against cash transactions.

The assessing officers have been directed to penalise those using cash while buying properties, luxury items like jewellery and cars or while paying bills at hospitals.

According to a senior official, the I-T Dept missed the tax collection target of Rs 12 lakh crore.

"We have been directed to focus on new areas from the beginning of the new financial year," said the official.

"We have found about 27,000 cases of cash transactions in the purchase of properties where I-T laws were violated. We need to recover about Rs 5,500 crore soon," he said. As per the law of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) effective from June 1, 2015, any transaction in real estate -- including agricultural land -- is required to be made through account payee cheque or the real time gross settlement (RTGS) or electronic funds transfer if the amount is Rs 20,000 or above.

If a transaction is done in cash, then the penalty of an amount equal under Section 271 D of the Income Tax Act is imposed on the seller.More than 1,100 such cases of cash transaction of more than Rs 2 lakh were recorded last financial year.

According to Section 269ST of the Income Tax Act, no person can receive Rs 2 lakh or more from another person in one day.Income tax authorities imposed penalties of about Rs 45 crore in such transactions along with another Rs 45 crore on top hospitals and luxury brand showrooms for violations.

During a face-to-face encounter, she said, prosecutors can refresh a witness’s memory by providing additional details or showing him documents. They can also come to a judgment based on body language.

“I have not dealt with a witness who has claimed not to remember facts as many times as Trump did, but it is impossible to read a witness’s mind to know whether he is telling the truth,” she said. “Trump’s refusal to participate in an interview,” she added, “hampered Mueller’s investigation and contradicts” the assertion by Attorney General William P. Barr that the president had cooperated fully.

But it may have saved him from a worse outcome. Mr. Mueller began asking Mr. Trump for an interview in December 2017 only to be put off for months. The president’s lawyers opposed the idea, worried that Mr. Trump, who has a documented history of making untrue assertions publicly, would testify falsely and walk into what they deemed a perjury trap.

Bowing to the demands of the president’s lawyers, Mr. Mueller agreed to submit written questions, and only about contacts with Russia before Mr. Trump took office, not about potential obstruction of justice once he entered the White House. When the answers came back in November, they were so “incomplete or imprecise,” the report said, that Mr. Mueller complained to the president’s legal team about “the insufficiency of those responses.”

The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president’s usual colorful language. They included phrases like “named entities or individuals” and “tangible support” and “no meaningful relationship.”

It may be hard to imagine Mr. Trump saying or writing this: “In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution and sources of information for the speech I expected to give ‘probably’ on the Monday following my June 7, 2016, comments.”

But if his memory were hazy in many cases, it was crystal clear in at least one instance. Asked about a specific date that June, Mr. Trump noted that he had prevailed in Republican nomination contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and South Dakota that day. “I remember winning those primaries,” he wrote.
The Massachusetts senator is the most senior Democrat to call for the start of impeachment proceedings against Trump

Elizabeth Warren on Friday became the most senior Democrat, and the first 2020 presidential candidate, to call for the start of impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump following the release of the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 US election and the Trump campaign.

The key unanswered questions from the Mueller report Read more

“To ignore a president’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways,” the Democratic senator from Massachusetts said in a statement Friday, one day after the release of a redacted version of a 448-page summary of Robert Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation.

“The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States,” Warren said.

Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.” The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.

Mueller did not make a conclusion about whether the president unlawfully obstructed justice, but did outline nearly a dozen cases in which the president had attempted to stop the inquiry or narrow its scope.

Warren’s remarks make her one of the most prominent Democratic voices to advocate for impeachment, joining congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib. Those progressive House members have pushed a formal impeachment resolution.

Backers of impeachment have argued that the Democrats have a legal and ethical responsibility to launch the proceedings and continue the investigation into Trump and the question of obstruction of justice.

Other Democrats fear that it would be politically unwise to begin the impeachment process close to the 2020 presidential election, raising concerns that a protracted political battle could alienate some voters and arguing that voters ultimately care more about issues like heathcare and the economy. Some have said they are also wary of vice-president Mike Pence replacing the president, given Pence’s conservative political record.

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has repeatedly said she is not in favor of impeachment. In March, Pelosi said the process would be “so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path”. She did not shift her stance after the release of the Mueller report this week.

Mueller's report would have signaled the end for anyone other than Trump Read more

Some Democrats have instead focused on their calls to have Mueller testify before Congress and for the justice department to release an unredacted version of the report.

So far, Warren is the only Democrat running for president in 2020 to formally call for impeachment hearings. Though Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, indicated earlier on Friday that he would support Congress opening impeachment proceedings. “It would be perfectly reasonable for Congress to open up impeachment hearings”, Castro told CNN.

Both senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker argued it was too soon to talk about impeachment. “I think that there is definitely a conversation to be had on that subject, but first I want to hear from Bob Mueller.” Harris said.

Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend mayor, said there was “evidence that this president deserves to be impeached”, but that it was up to Congress to make that decision.

The former representative Beto O’Rourke argued he believed voters cared more about policy discussions, telling reporters, “I don’t know that impeachment and those proceedings in the House and potential trial in the Senate is going to answer those questions for people.”
Group to hold ‘effective alternative healing’ event in Washington state in which they peddle a ‘sacrament’ known to be industrial cleaner

A group calling itself Genesis II Church of Health and Healing plans to convene at a hotel resort in Washington state on Saturday to promote a “miracle cure” that claims to cure 95% of all diseases in the world by making adults and children, including infants, drink industrial bleach.

The group is inviting members of the public through Facebook to attend what they call their “effective alternative healing” at the Icicle Village Resort in Leavenworth on Saturday morning. The organizer of the event, Tom Merry, has publicized the event on his personal Facebook page by telling people that learning how to consume the bleach “could save your life, or the life of a loved one sent home to die”.

The “church” is asking attendants of the meeting to “donate” $450 each, or $800 per couple, in exchange for receiving membership to the organization as well as packages of the bleach, which they call “sacraments”. The chemical is referred to as MMS, or “miracle mineral solution or supplement”, and participants are promised they will acquire “the knowledge to help heal many people of this world’s terrible diseases”.

In fact, MMS consists of chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach that is used both on textiles and in the industrial treatment of water. It has been banned in several countries around the world for use as a medical treatment.

In the US, the chemical cannot be sold for human consumption. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put out a public warning after it was notified of many injuries to consumers from drinking the fluid, with symptoms that included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe dehydration and one person who had a life-threatening reaction.

The FDA issued the blunt advice: “Consumers who have MMS should stop using it immediately and throw it away.”

A spokesman for the FDA told the Guardian that the agency could not comment on possible civil or criminal law enforcement actions, but added: “The FDA continues to advise consumers about the dangers of Miracle Mineral Solution and the agency has issued warnings to consumers over the past decade.”

The headline attraction of Saturday’s event in Leavenworth is Mark Grenon, a self-appointed “bishop” of the Genesis II Church. He is author of a book titled Imagine A World Without Dis-Ease: Is It Possible?

In a video posted on the “church’s” website, Grenon says that the “sacramental protocols” sold by the group can eliminate 95% of the world’s diseases, including malaria, ebola, dengue fever, all types of cancer, diabetes, autism, HIV and multiple sclerosis. It sells 4oz bottles of sodium chlorite as “sacramental cleansing water” for $15, giving instructions on how to mix it with citric acid to make chlorine dioxide.

The Guardian contacted Grenon to ask why he was peddling industrial bleach described by the FDA as potentially dangerous as a miracle cure, but he did not immediately respond.

As promotion for the event, Merry has posted on Facebook a link to a video which claims to show people with malaria being cured in two hours. The video shows a British advocate of MMS travelling to a village in Uganda where he arranges for several villagers to be given the “miracle cure”.

One of the victims shown in the film is an infant lying in his or her mother’s arms who is made to drink a cup of the bleach. The child screams as the fluid is swallowed.

The Guardian tried to contact both Merry and the Icicle Village Resort, but neither responded.

Fiona O’Leary, a campaigner against pseudo science whose work helped to get MMS banned in Ireland in 2016, said she was horrified that the Genesis II Church, which she called a “bleach cult”, was hosting a public event in Washington.

“This event is endangering people’s lives, especially children. We must protect vulnerable people from this dangerous quackery,” she said.

This is not the first time that Washington state has grappled with a group touting MMS. In 2015 Louis Smith from Spokane was convicted in the Eastern District of Washington for selling misbranded drugs and defrauding the US. He had sold MMS through a website called Project GreenLife, having obtained sodium chlorite fraudulently by creating a phony “water purification” business.

He was sentenced to four years in prison.

Ukraine's rival presidential candidates have held a long-awaited head-to-head televised debate at Kiev's giant Olympic stadium.

Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky and incumbent president Petro Poroshenko shook hands before launching scathing attacks on one another.

Mr Zelensky is the clear favourite for Sunday's second-round vote, polls say.

But Mr Poroshenko argues that he is a political novice unfit for such a demanding job.

Mr Zelensky has relied on a slick social media campaign to tap into the frustration of many younger Ukrainians with establishment politicians, cronyism and corruption.

The debate in the capital's 70,000-seat stadium - where Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber Mr Zelensky's - was the first and only direct clash between the two rivals in the campaign.

The stadium had been divided into two halves for the debate, with a stage for each candidate to speak from at each end of the pitch - but Mr Poroshenko and Mr Zelensky ended up speaking on the same stage.

What did they say?

"I am not a politician," said Mr Zelensky, who spoke first. "I am just a simple person who has come to break down this system."

Mr Poroshenko responded by accusing his rival of avoiding active-duty military service and said he would not be able to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"We only have a beautiful and bright sweet wrapper in which everyone can find what he is looking for," he said.

A score draw

By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Kiev

Two days before the final round of the election Mr Zelensky, a comedian, exchanged views with his opponent President Poroshenko for the first time.

Despite having no political experience Mr Zelensky is the favourite to win.

The polls suggest he is on track to get more than twice as many votes on Sunday.

So anything bar a complete humiliation in this debate was really a victory for the comedian.

In the event, this head to head encounter - played out on football pitch - was probably a score draw.

Both men flung insults at the other - with Mr Zelensky saying his own candidacy was the direct result of the president's mistakes and broken promises.

Mr Poroshenko in turn accused the comedian of complete incompetence and said he had often made jokes at Ukraine's expense.

How did we get here?

The debate was agreed more than a week ago, but they disagreed over the date for it.

On 14 April Mr Poroshenko turned up at the stadium and used Mr Zelensky's absence as an opportunity to answer journalists' questions and attack the comedian.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Poroshenko's supporters appeared to outnumber those of his rival

Earlier, Mr Zelensky had set a surprise condition for holding such a debate: they must both undergo blood tests to detect any drugs or alcohol. Both were then photographed separately giving blood samples.

Who are the candidates?

Mr Zelensky is a dollar millionaire, thanks to his popular comedy series and other acting roles, while Mr Poroshenko is a billionaire who got rich through confectionery and TV businesses.

Mr Zelensky's links to billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky - a leading opponent of Mr Poroshenko - have led some to question the comedian's credibility as a true "outsider" candidate.

Mr Poroshenko took power in a 2014 election following an uprising that overthrew the previous pro-Russian government. His supporters credit him with bolstering the army, making Ukraine's Orthodox Church independent of Russia and securing visa-free travel to Europe.

However concerns over corruption remain.
News outlet McClatchy relied on sketchy, anonymous sources – likely from opposition research firm Fusion GPS – to produce two articles last year claiming former Trump attorney Michael Cohen was in Prague in 2016, allegedly to meet with Russians about stealing the election.

Now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report has been released, we know for sure that these two McClatchy articles are false. Cohen was never in Prague, just as he claimed. Cohen, being a proven liar, can’t be taken at just his word, but he also showed his passport to prove he had never been to Prague.

The Mueller report states unequivocally: “Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.”

As I wrote in January, this claim from the dossier created by ex-British Intelligence official Christopher Steele, should have been easy to prove. Yet no major media outlet could. The Washington Post even sent reporters to every hotel in Prague to see if Cohen had stayed there, and came up empty (naturally, they didn’t report this damning revelation).

McClatchy has now added an “editor’s note” to its two Cohen-in-Prague stories. The first article, published on April 13, 2018, still has the original title claiming Mueller had evidence Cohen was in Prague, but now includes the following noted at the top of the article:

EDITOR’S NOTE: Robert Mueller’s report to the attorney general states that Mr. Cohen was not in Prague. It is silent on whether the investigation received evidence that Mr. Cohen’s phone pinged in or near Prague, as McClatchy reported.

The same note is attached to the second story, about Cohen’s cell phone allegedly “pinging” in or near Prague.

Notice how they can’t let that one go. In a separate article, McClatchy continues to hold to their reporting about the cell phone. That piece is titled “Mueller report states Cohen was not in Prague. It is silent on whether a Cohen device pinged there.”

The media outlet is desperately trying to hold onto a shred of credibility. Anonymous sources told them Cohen was in Prague. They were wrong. Anonymous sources told them Cohen’s cell phone pinged in or near Prague. There’s no evidence to suggest these sources are different.

If Cohen wasn’t in Prague, why would Mueller spend time and resources tracking down whether someone else had one of his devices in Prague (or manipulated location-sharing information on one of his devices).

McClatchy’s original report claimed Mueller had this cell phone information. Perhaps that was also a lie from their anonymous sources. Maybe it’s not in the Mueller report because Mueller never actually had such information. McClatchy essentially wants credit for reporting on nonexistent information.

It looks like the Mueller report did use cell-phone data to geo-locate someone else in the investigation, which McClatchy reports:

The report was silent on the issue of a device linked to Cohen pinging from the Czech Republic, and whether the investigation was ever presented with such evidence. The report confirms the investigation used this type of evidence, noting cell-tower records geo-located another person relevant to the investigation. (The investigation geo-located Erik Prince, former head of security firm Blackwater, at Trump Tower, for example.)

So, it’s reasonable to conclude that if Mueller had such information on Cohen, it would have been in the report. Since it’s not in the report, McClatchy can’t cling to this story and pretend they weren’t wrong.
This week, two high-profile Democrats mouthed their party's delusional mantra that President Trump is a threat to the Constitution — a rich allegation from those would dismantle major pillars of our republican system of government.

While the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris was still burning, quixotic impeachment crusader Rep. Steve Cohen said on MSNBC's "Hardball," "What he has done to the Constitution and the rule of law is as bad as that fire did to Notre Dame. He's torching the entire structure of government and the people's respect for it. And the Congress needs to act." Poor form, poor judgment and just plain over-the-top insanity.

The next day on CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, "Everything is at stake in this election: the Constitution of the United States, with the president who's trying to usurp the power of the legislative branch of government; the environment in which we live; a Republican Party that is in denial about the assault on climate and the climate crisis, which is a health issue, a national security issue, an economic and jobs issue, and a moral issue." Misguided, incoherent hyperbole.

I doubt that these dueling attacks were coordinated. When the party sings from the same hymnal — at least on Trump — conspiratorial coordination is unnecessary. But it's noteworthy that they're still beating this drum, even though their collusion gambit has backfired and considering that they are the ones engaging in a full-scale assault on the Constitution. Let us count the ways.

The framers believed our rights are God-given and thus inalienable, and they sought to ensure them by designing a system of limited government. Just providing for the people's democratic participation would be insufficient to secure their liberty, because people can vote themselves into tyranny. They knew men aren't angels and that, left to their own devices, they would eventually subjugate others. So, in addition to establishing the Bill of Rights, they divided power among different levels of government — national, state and local — and within the federal branch — legislative, executive and judicial. They crafted a partially but not purely democratic system. Indeed, they imposed safeguards against pure democracy (including the Electoral College), which they knew could lead to mob rule.

Democrats complain about Trump's supposedly authoritarian disposition — pointing to his bullying nature and combative tweets, as if Stalin, Mao or Hitler would have relied on such anemic methods to amass their power and terrorize their people. Please don't respond that Trump is engaged in Nazi-like propaganda, and that he threatens the freedom of the press by calling the "fake news media" the "enemy of the people." Trump is mostly defending himself against the daily barrage of propaganda leveled against him by a dishonest, monolithic leftist media that is the arm of the Democratic Party. His rhetorical rejoinders seek to showcase the unfairness and dishonesty of his detractors. And unaccompanied by any effort to muzzle them, they are, in the scheme of things, harmless. They are certainly no threat to the Constitution.

Long before their recent barrage of proposals to alter and circumvent the Constitution to make it easier for them to win elections, the Democrats worked to undermine our system of limited government. Their judicial activism resulted in the judiciary usurping powers from the other two political branches, thereby upsetting the constitutional scheme. Their penchant for their presidents to issue unlawful executive orders has also undermined the balance of powers. Their passage of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 resulted in an enormous power shift from Congress to unelected, unaccountable executive branch bureaucrats whose administrative agencies are models of the type of tyranny the framers warned about because they combine legislative, executive and judicial powers under one tent. By the way, the allegedly anti-Constitution ogre, President Trump, has done more to disempower this "fourth branch of government" than any other president, and the constitutional system is stronger, not weaker, as a result.

More recently, Democrats have proposed a rash of disturbing ideas designed to alter our system of government through fundamental changes in our elections. The same Steve Cohen who's now yelling about President Trump's threat to the constitutional order introduced a bill to effectively eliminate the Electoral College and provide for the direct election of the president and vice president. Democrats have advanced proposals to pack the Supreme Court, and a majority of them have voted to reduce the voting age to 16, which is egregious on multiple levels and unwise. In addition, Pelosi introduced the euphemistically dubbed For the People Act, which would overhaul federal election laws to micromanage and centralize the election process now administered by the states, and which would favor the election of Democrats. Other examples of Democrats' mischief that impairs free and fair elections include their opposition to voter ID laws and their objection to a citizenship question on the census form.

And please don't get me started on the Democrats' failed coup to delegitimize and oust President Trump, or their ongoing efforts to baselessly impeach him. Suffice it to say that he represents no threat to the Constitution, but Democrats do. But why shouldn't they? Many of them have openly said that America is not that great, so why trifle over preserving the integrity of the document whose ideas make it unique?

According to the Washington Free Beacon, for some inexplicable reason, the journalistic outlet to rival all other outlets – The New York Times – reported that the "body of Christ" saved from the flaming Notre Dame cathedral earlier this week was a statue, even though no other media outlet reported it as such, and even though the most rudimentary understanding of Catholicism would lead one to conclude the term "body of Christ" does not refer to a statue.

The Times story detailed the heroic work of Paris Fire Department chaplain, Father Jean-Marc Fournier, and his effort to save priceless relics from the Notre Dame fire, including the crown of thorns (believed to have been worn by Christ at his crucifixion) and the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as "the body of Christ." Here's what the article said:

As the chaplain began removing a statue of Jesus, he said, his colleagues were fighting the fire from the cathedral’s towers. The flames had started to threaten the wooden structure around the belfry — putting the whole cathedral at even greater risk. With the statue in hand, Father Fournier, alone in the nave, gave a benediction to the cathedral, he said. 'I thought Jesus could help us a little bit and work, too,' he said. 'I invited him to worry about his own house if he didn’t want to finish the night under a tent by the Canal Saint-Martin.'

Catholic doctrine states that the wafer and wine become the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ when a priest consecrates it while still retaining its original form – a process known as transubstantiation.

As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, what was most odd about Times referring to the "body of Christ" as a statue is that no other outlet made that reference – not even CNN.

"Weirdly, there was no other reporting about Fournier saving a Jesus statue from Notre Dame. For that matter, Notre Dame cathedral doesn't even have a Jesus statue," reports the Free Beacon. "He co-stars in the famous Pieta and a statue of the Virgin and Child (both unharmed), but neither could be lugged around by an elderly priest."

Later, the New York Times added a correction to the article saying, "an earlier version of this article misidentified one of two objects recovered from Notre-Dame by the Rev. Jean-Marc Fournier. It was the Blessed Sacrament, not a statue of Jesus." While some might simply write the mistake off as a poor translation of Father Founier's words, the Free Beacon noted that "the Times reporter in question appears to be fluent in French."

Despite the mishap, Father Fournier did indeed save the Blessed Sacrament from the fire that night along with the crown of thorns. He told reporters that his profound faith in the sacrament motivated him to save it as the cathedral went up in flames.

"I asked Jesus — and I really believe he is present in these hosts — to fight the flames and preserve the building dedicated to his mother," said Fournier, according to the National Catholic Register.

When asked about his thoughts at the moment, Fournier said he remembered the blessing on Ash Wednesday: "Remember you are dust and to dust you will return."
Actress and self-described “climate change activist" Emma Thompson flew from Los Angeles to London — some 5,400 miles — to give an impassioned speech on climate change at an Extinction Rebellion protest. Ironically, the famed actress railed against the “hypocrisy” of her government concerning climate change while at the protest, fresh off her long flight to London. And adding insult to injury, the protest announced plans to block flights out of a major airport on the day Thompson arrived.

The Independent reported Friday that Thompson said in a video promoting the event that she “was unable to be at the first day of the protest because she was ‘away’ with her husband as she turned 60.”

"I absolutely wanted to be arrested on my 60th birthday but I didn't quite manage that. I’m so proud and thrilled to be part of Extinction Rebellion,” the actress said.

“A representative of Dame Emma said she needed to take the 5,400-mile flight home to London after working in LA,” the report said.

Ironically, young people attending the protest announced plans to target the Heathrow Airport because “air travel is so damaging to the environment,” Sky News reported.

In an interview with Sky News, the actress said she has personally seen the “evidence” of climate change, citing “bare glaciers,” and lamented the alleged “hypocrisy” of her government.

“I really do care about my children and my grandchildren enough to want to be here today to stand next to the next generation, who are so inspiring, who so understand the problem. It’s all though we’ve just been going around — well, not me actually, we’ve been banging about it for years, and so have many, many people — but I really do feel like, I can’t even describe the level of hypocrisy of our government,” she told a Sky News reporter.

"We will occupy until you take action because that's the only way we are going to save our planet,” Thompson said, according to The Independent.

“We have to be here, we have to do this. It's inconvenient for people sometimes but its much more inconvenient to leave a planet that's so completely destroyed,” she added.

Thompson, however, is not alone in climate change hypocrisy. As highlighted in a report from Investor’s Business Daily (IBD), Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio and and former Vice President Al Gore are also jet-setting Global Warming alarmists.

“It can be estimated that DiCaprio has potentially emitted up to 418.4 tons of CO2 this year because of his globe-trotting. The average American emits 19 tons a year," a report from The Daily Mail stated last year, IBD noted. The star also "celebrated New Year's Eve on a yacht in the Sydney Harbor, then flew with his pals to Las Vegas to ring in the New Year a second time.”

Mr. Gore is a jet-setter, too, and owns a Tennessee mansion that uses "more than 21.3 times that of the U.S. household average” of electricity in a month, The Daily Signal reported in 2017. In a single month, “Gore's home consumed more electricity than the average family uses in 34 months,” the outlet added.

WATCH:
Spain’s socialist PSOE party has vowed to outlaw prostitution in a series of measures designed to appeal to female voters ahead of the general election on 28 April, according to reports.

With polls suggesting women make up as much as half of the 40% of undecided voters, the party, led by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has published a female-friendly manifesto. It contrasts with claims by some rightwing parties that so-called “feminazis” are discriminating against men.

Although it did not appear in the manifesto published on Monday, PSOE sources told El País that, under pressure from feminist groups, an updated document would assert that “prostitution, which we aim to abolish, is one of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women”.

The party also proposes to clamp down on surrogacy agencies, which it says “undermine the rights of women, in particular the most vulnerable, by treating their bodies and reproductive functions as merchandise”. The issue has on occasion been a source of friction between some feminist and LGBT groups.

The manifesto also promises to introduce equal parental leave, of 16 weeks, for men and women, and to revise the sexual offences law to make the issue of positive consent – yes means yes – the deciding factor.

Meanwhile, Spain’s rightwing parties have tried to appeal to men who they say are being undermined by feminism. In last December’s regional elections in Andalucía, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary general of the far-right Vox party, demanded that gender violence laws be scrapped, claiming they discriminated against men.

Santiago Abascal, Vox’s leader, called for an end to subsidies going to what he called “radical feminist groups” and the scrapping of the gender violence law in favour of a new law against “family violence that protects the elderly, men, women and children equally”.

Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party, provoked an outcry among some Spanish women when he appealed to traditional Catholic voters, declaring: “Women should know that what they carry inside them is another life.”

“Thanks for clearing that up, Pablo,” one woman tweeted. “I thought I was carrying a Kinder egg.”

Justifying his party’s refusal to support the international women’s day march on 8 March, in which hundreds of thousands of women took part, Casado said it was designed “to provoke a confrontation between men and women and to divide them”.

Albert Rivera, the leader of the centre-right Citizens party, advised the Podemos party leader, Pablo Iglesias, who recently became the father of twins, that “sometimes you have to pretend to be asleep to avoid changing nappies”.

Far-right Vox party set for breakthrough in Spanish elections Read more

The PSOE pledge to abolish prostitution would require a change in the law as, while pimping and trafficking are illegal in Spain, prostitution is not.

There are an estimated 100,000 sex workers in Spain, in a trade worth around €3.5bn (£3bn) a year. Police and NGOs estimate around 80% of sex workers have been trafficked.

Surveys suggest around 39% of Spanish men have paid for sex, a far higher proportion than in the majority of European countries.
South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing to conduct a review of consumer regulations for mobile and computer games, with a focus on in-game purchases.

According to According to The Korea Herald , ten companies have been contacted by the FTC so far for their opinions, including Nexon, NCSoft, Blizzard, and Riot Games.

The FTC will be going over a number of clauses related to consumer purchases in games, particularly focusing on issues involving minors making those purchases. Examples of what will be reviewed include unclear or vague clauses with mentions of parental approval being needed for underage players to sign up, limited refunds for in-game items even when the person receiving the in-game item hasn't gotten it yet, and when gifted items have extremely limited periods of use.

A spokesperson for the FTC told The Korea Herald that the FTC sees such clauses as "unfair."

"Some news reports suggest that it may become easier for people to get refunds for in-game purchases if they can prove that their children used credit cards without permission," he continued. "But if an underage user actively deceives parents, that's on the kids. If a minor spends more than the legally allowed amount of 70,000 won ($62) a month, he or she will be held accountable."
(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence has accused Huawei Technologies of being funded by Chinese state security, The Times said on Saturday, adding to the list of allegations faced by the Chinese technology company in the West.

The CIA accused Huawei of receiving funding from China’s National Security Commission, the People’s Liberation Army and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network, the British newspaper reported, citing a source.

Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence shared its claims with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, which includes Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the report bit.ly/2KT7ztd.

Huawei dismissed the allegations in a statement cited by the newspaper.

“Huawei does not comment on unsubstantiated allegations backed up by zero evidence from anonymous sources,” a Huawei representative told The Times.

The company, the CIA and China’s Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The accusation comes at a time of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and amid concerns in the United States that Huawei’s equipment could be used for espionage. The company has said the concerns are unfounded.

Authorities in the United States are probing Huawei for alleged sanctions violations.

Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.

She denies wrongdoing and her father has previously said the arrest was “politically motivated”.

Amid such charges, top educational institutions in the West have recently severed ties with Huawei to avoid losing federal funding.

Another Chinese technology company, ZTE Corp 0763.HK, 000063.SZ, has also been at the center of similar controversies in the United States.

U.S. sanctions forced ZTE to stop most business between April and July last year after Commerce Department officials said it broke a pact and was caught illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea. The sanctions were lifted after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties.

Reuters reported earlier this week that the United States will push its allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks.

People having their sexual orientation or gender identity revealed without their consent has become a deepening problem in Japan, a country known for its culture in which the “nail that sticks out gets hammered down.”

In recent years, there have been a growing number of cases in which a person has been outed by someone they trust, sometimes resulting in the affected person feeling they have to quit school or work to escape the fallout.

In the most tragic cases, outings have affected victims’ well-being, causing some to suffer mental health issues or even take their own lives. Experts argue that such malicious or careless intrusions into someone’s personal life should be considered discriminatory and possible grounds for criminal charges.

In June 2015, a 25-year-old male graduate student at Hitotsubashi University law school was outed as gay by a fellow student. The victim had his secret revealed to a group of nine peers on a messaging app.

“It’s impossible for me to hide the fact that you’re gay anymore,” the classmate wrote to the group, ending the life-changing message with a simple “sorry.”

Just two months earlier, the student had come out to the classmate and expressed romantic feelings toward him.

After he was outed, the student felt the need to visit a clinic specializing in psychosomatic disorders. Then, in August, he sent a message to the group, saying he cannot see himself operating in the same professional circle as the person who outed him and he “can no longer see this as an ideal profession.” He later fell to his death from a building at the university in an apparent suicide.

The parents of the student sued both the classmate and the university for damages, claiming the university failed to respond properly to their son’s ordeal. Although a settlement was reached with the classmate, the Tokyo District Court dismissed the parents’ claim against the university in February. The family is appealing the case.

“Outing someone destroys human relationships,” the parents’ lawyer Kazuyuki Minami said at a news conference following the verdict.

“The court offered no mention at all on the substantive question of whether or not outing is an unlawful act,” he said, clearly frustrated by the court’s decision.

Over the course of six years from March 2012, one private support center said it received 110 calls to its 24-hour hotline service from people aggrieved about being outed.

But because the hotline in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 did not categorize callers as having suffered an outing, and due to the heavy volume of calls that went unanswered, the total is believed to be up to 24 times higher than the 110 documented cases, the Shakaiteki Hosetsu Support Center said.

Indeed, experts point out this is a perfect demonstration of the damage being done to members of the LGBT community.

According to the center, there were 31 calls by people wanting to talk about being outed in fiscal 2012, 42 in fiscal 2015, 19 in fiscal 2016 and 18 in fiscal 2017.

Many of those who called said they were outed after confiding in someone they trusted or were bad-mouthed by friends for making “a sick display of affection.”

Other than outing cases, many people call the hotline seeking advice about coping with their sexual orientation or gender identity, asking whether or not it is wise to reveal their secret.

Shinya Maezono, a lawyer who runs Saitama-based website lgbt.legaladvice.jp and has a long history of providing advice to the LGBT community, said the act of public outing can potentially have legal ramifications.

“There is a big possibility of civil or even criminal charges being brought,” said Maezono, adding that the lawsuits might involve invasion of privacy or defamation of character. He added that in cases of outing a person’s sexual orientation that involve threats, it is possible to have a criminal intimidation or extortion charge filed if money or valuables have been obtained through leverage.

Maezono explained that the root of the problem lies in society’s unwillingness to recognize sexual diversity. “Many sexual minorities are in a situation where they feel they must hide,” he said.

“First of all, people other than those concerned need to understand sexual minorities better and then we can hope that (it will allow LGBT people to) become more open.”

So what should be the proper response when a friend or coworker comes out to you?

Gon Matsunaka, a representative of a nonprofit organization that fights for sexual minority rights, said, “Coming out (to someone) is evidence of their trust in you. It is very important that you understand that this is serious and crucial information that (if discretion is not shown) could possibly have life-threatening ramifications.”

Matsunaka stressed that if such a revelation is made, the person involved should check if the person coming out wants anyone else to know and to what extent.

And “if you are unable to accept the news, you should talk to a person or group with expertise in the area and who will have the utmost discretion.”

To move forward in dealing with the problem of outing, “we need to recognize that each and every person is an individual and that it is crucial that we have mutual respect and understanding,” Matsunaka said.

Yuichi Kamiya, secretary-general of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation, warns “it is still the tip of the iceberg,” adding that most sexual minorities have experienced some form of discrimination.

Moreover, Kamiya says those who take the step to consult with a hotline have been pushed to the brink, the culture of discrimination taking them there.

Kamiya says he is calling on all members of society to be aware of the issue and for the government to create policy solutions before it becomes a full-blown crisis.

It is important for everyone to recognize that there “is a serious problem that is close at hand and touches the daily lives of many,” Kamiya said.
The Mueller report is written as a defense of the FBI and DOJ. It contains obvious bias against Donald Trump and his campaign. Examples of prejudice in the report run throughout and two examples were discussed last night on Fox News.

In one section, the report includes minute details about the Trump Tower meeting. While it details information about Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, it makes no mention whatsoever of her arrangement with Fusion GPS. In another example in the report, former Trump aide Michael Caputo’s communications with a Russian man offering dirt on Hillary were described. But nowhere in the report does Mueller explain the Russian was a 17-year FBI informant.

Wall Street Journal editor Kimberly Strassel reports that “by the fall of 2017, it was clear that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was too conflicted to take a detached look at a Russia-collusion story that had become more about FBI malfeasance than about Donald Trump.”

The report reflects the bias of Robert Mueller and his 19 Democrat investigators, 13 of whom were strong Hillary Clinton supporters.

What is also evident to those who read the report is that the 448-page report is a biased defense of the DOJ and FBI that relentlessly attempts to take Donald Trump out.

Volume I of the Mueller report, which deals with collusion, spends tens of thousands of words describing trivial interactions between Trump officials and various Russians. While it doubtless wasn’t Mueller’s intention, the sheer quantity and banality of details highlight the degree to which these contacts were random, haphazard and peripheral. By the end of Volume I, the notion that the Trump campaign engaged in some grand plot with Russia is a joke.

Yet jump to the section where the Mueller team lists its “prosecution and declination” decisions with regards the Russia question. And try not to picture Mueller “pit bull” prosecutor Andrew Weissmann collapsed under mountains of federal statutes after his two-year hunt to find one that applied.

In Volume II, Mueller, using his extraordinary powers, puts everything out, innuendo, everything, for public consumption, and doesn’t recommend charges himself. He did what Jim Comey got fired for doing.

Where’s the Dossier And Fusion GPS?

Tens of thousands of words were allocated to the Trump Tower meeting and everything was documented except for some extremely pertinent details. The report says nothing about Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya’s ties to Fusion GPS.

Veselnitskaya worked alongside Fusion GPS of dossier fame and met with them the day before and the day after the Trump Tower meeting.

Ms. Strassel explained on ‘Ingraham’ last night.

Where’s the FBI Informant Information?

Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo described the section about him in the “mischievous” Mueller report on Tucker last night.

Russian Henry Greenberg offered Caputo dirt on Hillary Clinton, and that was mentioned in the report, but they left out the fact that he was a 17-year FBI informant.

He was another plant, a spy, in other words.

The President Never Told Corey Lewandowski to Fire Mueller

The Mueller report claims the President asked Corey Lewandowski to help him fire Robert Mueller. Lewandowski denies it and says the President never asked him to fire him nor did he have the authority to fire him.
The Mueller report left some of President Donald Trump’s conduct up for debate, but clearly stated no collusion with Russia took place. Not for one journalist, who launched a Twitter crusade to prove otherwise...with 453 tweets.

Beginning on the evening before Attorney General William Barr’s pre-report press conference, Newsweek columnist and English professor Seth Abramson set out to live-tweet the report’s release. Helpfully, Abramson pointed out that he’s the bestselling author of ‘Proof of Collusion: How Trump Betrayed America.’

Clearly, he found some things to disagree with in the Mueller report – which showed the exact opposite – going on an epic rant in 453 tweets of anger, disbelief, and white-hot liberal rage, (condensed here for easy reading).

Abramson greeted Barr’s press conference as a chance for the Attorney General to “misrepresent” the report’s conclusions, and called on Democrats to “unleash” subpoenas on the Justice Department for the full, unredacted report, before he had even seen it. Democrats have since heeded this call, with Rep. Jerry Nadler firing off a subpoena first thing Friday morning.

27/ Democrats should respond to what Barr and the White House have done by unleashing *all* their subpoenas *tonight*. Scores of them. *Hundreds*, if need be. It's time to stop screwing around. — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 18, 2019

Abramson accused Trump of running a “domestic disinformation” campaign by claiming he did not collude with Russia, and accused Mueller of not going after enough types of collusion.

68/ Did Mueller look at bribery, money laundering, RICO, illegal solicitation of foreign campaign donations, aiding and abetting, conspiracy to defraud the United States (which might well be seen *not* as a conspiracy "with" Russian nationals) or just one strand of "conspiracy"? — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 18, 2019

The enraged columnist went on to draw a distinction between ‘collusion’ and ‘conspiracy,’ the first being a catch-all term for shady behavior and the second a criminal offense. Mueller’s report focused on the criminal definition and found nothing, but that’s because Abramson insists “Trump’s collusion with Russia was part of a *multinational* conspiracy Mueller didn’t investigate.”

91/ And the way Barr has framed the Mueller Report, it's *certain* we won't even get a *complete* answer on whether there was a criminal conspiracy in the collusion we know about—as Trump's collusion with Russia was part of a *multinational* conspiracy Mueller didn't investigate. — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 18, 2019

On and on the tweetstorm went, with Abramson making sure to remind readers that “nearly all of this content is in my book,” and “giving the finger” to critics.

“I’m sorry I had the full story more than you did,” he said. “I was right.”

This continues until he arrives at the main thrust of his insanely long Twitter thread: a plug for another upcoming book, promising to blow the lid on a wider, grander conspiracy to help Trump win the 2016 election. Whether the #Resistance will still be hungry for ‘Proof of Conspiracy’ by the time its August release date rolls around, however, is a different story.

I tweeted a few times yesterday about PROOF OF CONSPIRACY. Here it is, if you're interested in checking out the book description. It comes out in August. https://t.co/YBrqfTtZ4Q — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 19, 2019

Thursday’s Twitter MEGATHREAD broke the record set by the infamous December 2016 “game theory” tweetstorm by the self-described ‘strategic analyst’ Eric Garland, a 120-tweet thread linking supposed ‘Russian election interference’ with 9/11, Bill Clinton and Edward Snowden.

Abramson’s Twitter incontinence was mocked by the Right as another case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and an inability to let the ‘Russiagate’ narrative die. However, the self-appointed chief scribe of the #Resistance has also been slammed by the Left. Hard-liberal news site Slate even published an article in 2017 entitled “Democrats: Please, Please Stop Sharing Seth Abramson’s Very Bad Tweets.”

As Abramson tweeted bombshells and smoking guns, fishing for likes and retweets day in and day out, The Atlantic and New Republic called the professor a “conspiracy theorist,” while Deadspin called him “the king of diarrhea tweeting.” As #Resistance journalism goes, Abramson is closer to the notorious Krassenstein brothers than he is to even the most partisan hacks at CNN.

European intel agencies have given proof of Trump-Russia collusion to the FBI; Congress must now hold PUBLIC hearings. RETWEET if you agree. pic.twitter.com/sL7kGdbKk8 — Seth Abramson (@SethAbramson) April 18, 2017

What’s more, Abramson has been busted for outright lies before. Reporting for the Huffington Post in 2016, he declared that Bernie Sanders was actually winning the path to Democratic nomination, while the opposite was true. Confronted about the claim, Abramson called his reporting “experimental journalism” that embraces “the multi-dimensionality of the metanarrative.”

It’s a winter afternoon in Vancouver, and Mark Tyndall is taking me on a tour of all the places people can go if they want to use drugs and be pretty sure they won't die. Blue tarps and shabby tents with people sleeping in them line our route in the Downtown Eastside, where the wail of an ambulance siren is always around the corner. We see handwritten signs taped up in the back alleys, warning “Danger: Green Heroin. Use ¼ usual dose.” This is Canada’s skid row, a place where almost everyone can tell you about the friends and neighbors they’ve lost to an overdose. This city has seen a sixfold increase in overdose deaths over the last decade, with more than 1,000 of those people dying since 2016 alone. According to the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, more than 300 of those deaths happened in the last two years here in the Downtown Eastside, a roughly seven-block strip that contains one of North America’s densest populations of injection drug users. When we reach the dingy door marked Overdose Prevention Society, Tyndall swings it open and ushers me through. Inside the long, narrow space, there’s a red partition, behind which more than a dozen people sit at sterile metal tables. They come here because it’s a place where they can get a clean needle and inject drugs they buy off the street, with trained staff standing by to save their lives if that heroin turns out to be lethal. It’s one of six so-called overdose prevention sites (alternately known as supervised consumption sites or supervised injection sites) to open up in the city since 2016. That’s the year that the line charting illicit drug overdose deaths in British Columbia ticked sharply upward. Six overdose prevention sites have opened in Vancouver, British Columbia, since 2016. Samantha Cooper Fatal overdoses have spiked in the city, most of them caused by potent, often adulterated opioids. Samantha Cooper Tyndall walks past the partition to a young guy with a septum piercing named Colm, who’s keeping watch over the room. “Hi, I’m Mark Tyndall,” he says, extending a hand. At 59, Tyndall looks lean and youthful in a pair of light wash jeans and a sporty rust-colored jacket. He has big, round eyes that crinkle at the corners when he smiles. “Did you say Mark Tyndall? I definitely recognize that name,” Colm says, admiringly. “I imagine a lot of people do.” Colm is right about that. Tyndall is an unlikely local hero in a neighborhood that’s generally suspicious of bureaucrats. Tyndall has spent much of his career as one, most recently serving as executive director of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, or BCCDC. But if Tyndall is a bureaucrat, he’s a bureaucrat with a rebel’s heart. “The plight of people using drugs didn’t change four years ago,” says Mark Tyndall, a researcher at British Columbia’s CDC. “The drugs they’re using changed.” Samantha Cooper “Mark is a doctor who has contempt for the medical profession, which is a really valuable thing,” says Darwin Fisher, a manager at Insite, North America’s first official supervised consumption site, which is located just down the road. “He actually knows something about the people he’s dealing with.” A Harvard-trained doctor of infectious disease and epidemiology, Tyndall moved to Vancouver in the late 1990s after a stint treating HIV patients in Kenya. At the time, AIDS was decimating this neighborhood, and Tyndall took a job working at a local hospital, tending to patients’ injection-related diseases and helping research needle exchanges in their early days. He spent a night sleeping in one of the neighborhood’s single-room occupancy hotels to better understand his patients’ barely habitable living conditions and pushed the government to give drug users access to lifesaving antiretroviral medications—still an experimental idea at the time. When the overdose spike hit, it was Tyndall, already head of the BCCDC, who called up a local community group and urged them to set up a pop-up overdose prevention site inside a tent and invite the press to watch them work. And he has co-authored dozens of peer-reviewed studies on the various benefits of supervised injection sites, which officials and advocates in cities across the US now use as evidence that they need to take a similar strategy in addressing their own careening crises. But the thing that most likely triggered Colm’s memory—the thing that has landed Tyndall in the news recently, and the thing that, if you ask around, may have cost Tyndall his job at the BCCDC earlier this year—is his latest and most audacious idea for combatting the overdose crisis. It’s not enough to just give people safe spaces to use drugs anymore, he says. He also wants to give them safer drugs to use. And he wants to distribute them in vending machines.

Throughout North America, according to Tyndall, people who use drugs are being poisoned, not by the drugs themselves, but by all the other substances that have made their way into those drugs. Sure, the greedy pharmaceutical companies that made billions encouraging doctors to shower their patients in Oxycontin bear much blame for creating the addiction crisis. But what’s killing most people these days isn’t the pills. It’s not even the heroin people turn to when they get cut off from the pills. It’s the synthetic drugs—mainly fentanyl—that are cheaper, more potent, and easier to traffic. These substances have turned the drug supply toxic. In Vancouver, they’ve swallowed it whole. To be clear, heroin was never safe, but before 2015, at least, there were about 200 to 400 overdose deaths in British Columbia per year. Last year, there were 1,510. Today, the BC coroner reports, fentanyl is detected in four out of five of those deaths. That’s not unique to Canada. The same devastating trend is playing out in America, where synthetic drugs that scarcely registered a few years ago are now killing nearly as many people as heroin and prescription opioids combined. “The plight of people using drugs didn’t change four years ago,” Tyndall says. “The drugs they’re using changed.” Under President Donald Trump, the US has responded to this crisis by doubling down on law enforcement and beefing up border security. Canada, on the other hand, has embraced a philosophy known as harm reduction—which holds that it’s far more important to prevent people from dying of a drug overdose than it is to prevent them from doing drugs in the first place. In addition to getting people on opioid replacement therapies (like methadone and suboxone) and making overdose reversal drugs (like naloxone) widely available, Canada has allowed overdose prevention sites to proliferate. In just the last few years, dozens of them have opened from Vancouver to Toronto. Health authorities have begun placing fentanyl testing strips and spectrometers at supervised injection sites to help people figure out what’s in the drugs they’re about to take. These interventions—free of the kind of moralism that sometimes drives drug policy—have saved countless lives. The problem is, only a small slice of drug users ever step foot in these facilities. And so, the death toll continues to rise. As an infectious disease researcher, Tyndall notes, the trend lines almost defy logic. “Any epidemic by now would be falling, just because the vulnerable population is being culled,” he says. He believes a drastically new approach is in order. Which is why, about two years ago, in his role at the BCCDC, Tyndall began pushing Canadian health regulators to make a safer supply of opioids available to people. The thinking was, when iceberg lettuce starts poisoning people, the government does whatever it can to clear the produce aisle and replace the bad batches with fresh, uncontaminated romaine. But with a product as physically addictive as heroin, somehow, the most common response is to tell people to use smaller amounts or, more often, not to use drugs at all. “We’re acknowledging people will go to any extreme to use this drug,” he adds. “To tell them not to use because it’s unsafe is ridiculous.” Last year, the BCCDC won a $1.4 million grant from the federal health authority, Health Canada, for a pilot program, led by Tyndall, that will study the effects of giving the Downtown Eastside’s most at-risk drug users a regular allotment of hydromorphone pills (the chemical name for Dilaudid) which they can take home and use instead of buying street drugs. That, in and of itself, isn’t such a radical idea. Countries throughout Europe have been using opioids to treat people with opioid use disorder for decades. And in Vancouver, a growing community of researchers have turned the city into a sort of living laboratory for the scientific study of safe supply programs. Patrons at the Molson Overdose Prevention Site use hand mirrors to locate veins in their necks for injection. Samantha Cooper Jonathan Orr, a manager at The Molson Overdose Prevention Site, prepares injectable Naloxone, a drug that blocks opioid receptors and reverses the symptoms of an overdose. Samantha Cooper At Providence Crosstown Clinic in the Downtown Eastside, chronic injection drug users have been receiving injections of medical-grade heroin for years as part of two landmark longitudinal research projects. A few blocks away, at the Molson Overdose Prevention Site, another 104 patients are currently being treated with hydromorphone as part of a separate study. But so far, all of these studies have required patients to visit a clinic every day to get their drugs. Tyndall worries that’s too high a bar for a chaotic and often homeless population, already wary of institutions. With his new project, Tyndall wants to uncouple drug delivery from the doctor’s office. In fact, he wants to remove human beings from the equation almost entirely by distributing the pills in a high-tech, heavy-duty vending machine. The machine, designed in partnership with a Canadian tech company, would allow preapproved drug users who receive a prescription from their doctors to access safer opioids using a biometric scan of the veins in their hands. Such a mechanized approach, Tyndall believes, is the only way that an intervention like this can match the scope of the problem. After a year and a half of development and endless delays, Tyndall expects the first of these machines to arrive in Vancouver before summer. Whether he’ll ever get the government approval or funding to actually test the thing is another question altogether. The vending machine that would dole out safer opioids can identify a person with a prescription by scanning the unique pattern of veins on their hand. Nick Simhoni The concept of a vending machine for drugs is controversial, to say the least. Since he first floated the idea in December 2017, Tyndall has fielded endless knee-jerk reactions accusing him of enabling drug use, as well as legitimate fears about the pills being diverted to school kids and soccer moms. In January, the Provincial Health Services Authority, which oversees the BCCDC, unexpectedly removed Tyndall from his position, as part of a leadership change that the agency said would have forced Tyndall to focus less on research and more on administrative work. Now he’s continuing to lead research on the opioid crisis, albeit in a less prominent position with the CDC. The shift fueled speculation that Tyndall had pissed off one too many government officials with his unyielding activism. “They want someone who’s effective, but politically savvy,” speculates Russ Maynard, a community engagement manager at the local housing nonprofit Portland Hotel Society. “Don’t push too hard.” The Provincial Health Services Authority denies that had anything to do with it. “Mark’s a colorful, well-known guy,” says Laurie Dawkins, the agency’s vice president of communications. “These qualities make him amazing at his research and at advocating for things that are controversial and difficult, and we’re totally happy he’s carrying on with that.” In the midst of the changes, Tyndall also has struggled to get buy-in from regulators, like the College of Pharmacists. A vending machine is neither a pharmacy nor a pharmacist, meaning it doesn’t fit neatly into the existing rules regarding who can distribute drugs and where they can distribute them. “We have had many conversations with Dr. Tyndall, but we’ve yet to find a way for what he’s proposing to meet the requirements,” says Bob Nakagawa, the registrar for the College of Pharmacists. All of this opposition stands to reason. Tyndall’s proposal does sound radical, flying in the face of traditional treatment programs that preach the value of sobriety. If the government just gives people drugs, his critics ask, why would people ever quit using them? Isn’t offering this option tantamount to giving up on them? Tyndall’s heard it all before and he’s a little tired of the questions. Because his answer almost always boils down to the same darkly pragmatic, but profoundly empathetic point: Recovery, he argues, is a great option for people who recover. But lots of people never do. Right now, those people are at a greater risk of dying than ever before. The very least he, as a doctor, and we as a society, can do is find a way to keep them alive. “To me,” he says, “it’s only ethical.”

Tyndall is leading me to another stop on the tour, just past the litter-strewn, triangular spot of concrete generously named Pigeon Park, when he spots a familiar face. “Hey, Dean!” Tyndall calls out. Dean Wilson walks toward us, smiling wide underneath his goatee, a leather jacket zipped up tight, hiding the canvass of tattoos that cover his back. Wilson is 63 now and carries more meat on his bones than he used to, but he still bears some resemblance to the wiry revolutionary, who once marched a black coffin into a Vancouver city council meeting to send a message about HIV and overdose deaths. Wilson has been using heroin since he was 13. If it hadn’t been for people like him, banging on doors to advocate for supervised injection in the early 2000s, Tyndall wouldn’t have much to show me on this tour. But in 2003, Wilson and an army of his fellow drug users succeeded in getting the city to open North America’s first sanctioned supervised consumption site, called Insite. From the outset, Insite was as much a public health intervention as it was a scientific experiment. The Canadian government granted the nonprofit a temporary exemption from the country’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, while researchers studied the program’s effects. Tyndall, who was working at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at the time, was one of the lead investigators on the project. In the earliest days, he and his co-investigators were wary of overwhelming Insite’s participants with lengthy surveys and probing questions. So they started off small, assigning research assistants to simply sit across the street and count the number of people walking in the door. Gradually, though, their research expanded. And the results were profoundly counterintuitive or at least inconsistent with conventional wisdom. In 2005, they published a study showing that Insite visitors shared syringes at substantially lower rates than the rest of the community. In 2006, they published another report which found that while a large number of overdoses had taken place inside Insite, there had been no fatalities. (That finding holds true to this day.) Tyndall’s team produced evidence that, contrary to people’s concerns, Insite did not increase drug use, that it did not lead to more drug-related crime, and that it had ancillary benefits, like increasing condom use among visitors. They also published two separate studies showing that, although recovery isn’t the goal of supervised injection, Insite did increase people’s likelihood to enter detox and other treatment programs. Upstairs from Insite is a detox facility called Onsite, where people can go whenever they feel ready. Over the years, the team produced an invaluable trove of evidence. “There was an agreement that no research would be in the public domain until it was externally peer-reviewed and published,” says Evan Wood, Tyndall’s co-author on these papers and the current director of the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use. Nevertheless, Insite’s critics remained resolute in their opposition. Among the most vocal was Stephen Harper, the man who would become prime minister in 2006, and who was quoted in 2005 saying, "We as a government will not use taxpayers' money to fund drug use." Once Harper was in office, it seemed certain that Insite’s days were numbered, and so in 2007 the Portland Hotel Society filed a lawsuit against the government, arguing that denying drug users access to these health services was a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the plaintiffs named in the case was none other than Dean Wilson. “I’m articulate. I’ve got a big mouth, and I was sick and tired of my friends fucking dying,” Wilson tells me all these years later. “I decided I was the lion who was going to protect the lambs.” The case dragged on for four years, weaving its way through the provincial court system. As Wilson and the other plaintiff, Shelley Tomic, racked up wins, the government kept appealing. Finally, the case landed before the Supreme Court of Canada, which issued a unanimous 9-0 ruling in Insite’s favor in September 2011. The day of the decision, Wilson says, the residents of the Downtown Eastside threw a party. The celebration wouldn’t last long. Because while Wilson and others were fighting for Insite’s survival, efforts to expand these initiatives around town largely stalled. At the same time, fentanyl was just starting to creep into the North American market. “There wasn’t a lot of progress made around harm reduction in the years following that, because of our Conservative government,” says Mark Lysyshyn, a medical health officer with the local regulator, Vancouver Coastal Health. “I think it left us really, in some ways, unprepared for the crisis.” Most people who live or work in the Downtown Eastside can instantly call to mind the first time they realized something new and lethal had hit the drug supply. For Wilson, it was seeing the unusually large number of collapsed bodies in the alleyways the day after welfare checks came out. For Tyndall, it was the coroner's reports. Between 2014 and 2016, his first two years at the helm of the BCCDC, the overdose death rate in British Columbia nearly tripled, and an increasingly large share of those deaths were from fentanyl. In April 2016, the province declared a public health emergency. By December of that year, the situation was so dire that the local health authorities dispatched a military-style mobile medical unit to the Downtown Eastside. It was intended as temporary triage. By March, the unit had intervened in 269 overdose cases. At the time, Insite was still one of just two supervised consumption sites approved by the federal government. But in the face of this surge, British Columbia’s minister of health took the extraordinary step of allowing more sites to open, even without federal approval. Almost overnight, new spaces began popping up in the Downtown Eastside and across the province. At first, the federal government gave its tacit consent by simply looking the other way, but eventually, Health Canada approved the creation of these overdose prevention sites in emergency situations. Different from Insite, which is officially categorized as a “supervised consumption site,” the overdose prevention sites are more informal, less medicalized, and require fewer regulatory approvals to start up. And yet, even with these sites in place, the body count kept rising.

For that, Tyndall saw two obvious explanations. The first: Plenty of people who use drugs would rather not be supervised while doing so, and are never going to supervised injection sites to begin with. (That, or they go to the sites, just not for every injection.) The second: People were still using tainted drugs they bought on the street. More than that, they still needed to shoplift, break into cars, and sell their bodies to make the money to buy those drugs. That locked people into a cycle of poverty and trauma, which often has everything to do with why they’re using drugs in the first place. “Once you get to Insite with a pocket full of dope, most of the problems are over,” Tyndall says. “The biggest stress is how to get that dope.” Giving people a safe supply of prescription opioids, Tyndall believed, would eliminate some of those societal stresses, and he began telling that to anyone who would listen. The timing, as it turned out, was apt. In April 2016, researchers who had been working with the Downtown Eastside’s Crosstown Clinic published a set of breakthrough findings from the so-called Study to Assess Long-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness trial, or SALOME. It was a follow-up to an earlier study, also run out of Crosstown, which found that participants who received daily shots of heroin in a supervised setting were more likely to stick with addiction treatment and less likely to commit crimes and take illicit street drugs than participants who were being treated with methadone. The problem was that heroin is both expensive and hard to come by in Canada, making it a tough sell as a broad medical intervention. So, for the SALOME trial, the researchers wanted to see if hydromorphone, a more readily available alternative, would have the same effect. They divided 202 participants into two groups. One received shots of heroin; the other got shots of hydromorphone. After six months of treatment, not only did the effects hold, but crucially, the participants couldn’t tell the difference between the two drugs. That was all the proof Tyndall needed to assert that a safe supply of hydromorphone pills could be a workable alternative to street drugs. But when he pitched the pilot to a federal grant program at Health Canada, he still hadn’t thought through how, exactly, he would go about distributing them. It wasn’t until much later that he even considered the option of a vending machine, blurting it out in an unscripted moment in December 2017. Tyndall was speaking at an overdose symposium in Victoria, British Columbia, and calling on the crowd to help him figure out a way to securely distribute the pills to a broad population. By way of getting the brainstorm started, he offered up the extreme option of using an opioid dispensing vending machine. “It was kind of off the top, and I didn’t really think about it,” he says. The remarks instantly got picked up—and picked apart—in the press. But the more Tyndall thought about it, and the more he fielded reporters’ questions, “I came to the conclusion this was the greatest idea ever.” All the coverage caught the attention of Corey Yantha, a young tech entrepreneur in Nova Scotia, whose company, Dispension Industries, had been tinkering away on vending machines to distribute cannabis, which is now legal in Canada. A few days after the symposium, Tyndall got a call from Yantha. “I hear you need vending machines for drugs,” Tyndall remembers him saying. “We have vending machines for drugs.” Yantha didn’t know much about harm reduction at the time, but after watching Tyndall’s TED talk and meeting with him in Halifax, he was sold on the idea. “He’s taken a lot of flak for his vision, but I think Mark is maybe one of the most forward-thinking people that I’ve ever heard speak or met,” Yantha says. The machine they’ve spent the last year and a half tweaking looks nothing like the metal-coiled contraption that holds potato chips and Snickers bars. Instead, it’s a more than 750-pound kiosk with a 24-inch shatter-proof video screen on the front that can be programmed to, say, broadcast public health alerts or display information about treatment programs. To the right of the screen is a small, square scanner that uses Fujitsu’s PalmSecure technology to take a biometric reading of the vein patterns in a person’s hand. Before accessing the machine, every user will have to get a prescription from a doctor and create a profile that determines their allotment of pills and how often they can access them. The bar to get into Tyndall’s trial would be set intentionally high so as to include only the most at-risk people in the Downtown Eastside. People will have to prove they are already injection drug users and face frequent urine tests to ensure they’re actually taking the prescription drugs. When people scan their hands, the machine will find their profiles, distribute the pills, then lock their accounts until it’s time to receive another dose. All of that biometric data, according to Yantha, is fully encrypted, and the machines themselves will be equipped with alarms and cameras to keep watch over the supply. Officials at Health Canada will be vetting the technical specifications to determine if Tyndall will receive more funding for this part of the project. So far, the $1.4 million grant that Health Canada gave the BCCDC is set aside for the first phase of the trial, in which human beings will distribute the drugs. “The professionals signing their names to this would want to see specifications that the machine can do what it says it can do, and that there’s a maintenance cycle and a backup plan in case there are errors,” says Kirsten Mattison, director of Health Canada’s Office of Drug Policy, Science and Surveillance. “We wouldn’t want people to get used to having access to a service, and that service gets taken away and they’re at risk again.” Getting the technology right is certainly a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. A far trickier thing for Tyndall is figuring out the best way to allay fears about people selling the pills off in the suburbs, or even worse, facing violence and threats from drug dealers who coerce them into handing them over. An even bigger question is how to accurately study whether any of this is happening at all. “Once a drug gets diverted, it’s outside your control,” says Vancouver Coastal Health’s Lysyshyn, who is supportive of the vending machine project. “What’s to prevent someone from taking the hydromorphone, adulterating it with a bunch of other drugs, then selling them? Then we’re part of the problem we’re trying to prevent.” That’s not a reason to avoid studying it, Lysyshyn hastens to add, but it’s critical to consider. “We need to do due diligence in making sure we’re doing no harm in the process of trying to do good,” says David Patrick, Tyndall’s successor at the BCCDC, who has known Tyndall for decades. “I think Mark’s got a brilliant hypothesis on this, but I don’t confuse a hypothesis with a conclusion.” Tyndall hasn’t quite come up with the most satisfying answers to these questions. He isn’t certain there is a way to do no harm. “There’s nothing in public health that we do that there are no unintended consequences,” he says. What he underscores the most is that buying drugs from dealers is already plenty dangerous. He doubts this will make it any worse. Knowing this vulnerable population the way he does, Tyndall thinks it’s unlikely that people who use drugs will do anything other than use the drugs they’re getting for free. Still, ever the realist, he admits there may not be a foolproof way to ensure that not one of the hydromorphone pills ends up in the wrong hands. He just believes it’s better than the alternative. “There’s a distinct possibility that one of these pills could slip into a high school,” Tyndall says. “But in the whole scheme of things, with 1,500 people dying, it’s a very small price to pay.”

About two blocks away from Pigeon Park, inside the old Molson bank building that’s been converted into a single-room occupancy hotel and an overdose prevention site, Christy Sutherland is leaving less to chance. Sutherland is a family and addiction doctor and medical director for the Portland Hotel Society, and like Tyndall, she also started thinking of ways to give people who use drugs safer access to those drugs around the rise of the fentanyl crisis in 2016, shortly after the SALOME paper published. “It started with a patient,” she says. That patient was Melody Cooper, better known in the Downtown Eastside by her nickname, Rambo. Now 44, Cooper had been using hard drugs since she was 27, often mixing heroin and crystal meth and at times working as a prostitute to make money. As a kid, she says she was raped by family members, and later, by a rotating cast of foster parents. Her husband abused her, her children were taken away from her, and though she’d tried to quit using drugs with methadone, suboxone, and various rounds of detox, nothing ever stuck. As the overdose death rate rose, Sutherland feared her patient would be next. So in September 2016, Sutherland decided to begin prescribing Cooper injectable hydromorphone. Unlike Tyndall’s approach, Sutherland designed it so that Cooper could only receive the injections under a nurse’s supervision. This is known as injectable opioid agonist treatment, which is different from safe supply programs in that it’s more tightly regimented. If the treatments succeeded in keeping Cooper off of street drugs, Sutherland explained, she would seek funding to study the idea with a much larger group. “I felt privileged. I felt special,” Cooper told me the day I visited the Molson. Melody Cooper, 44, started using hard drugs when she was 27. Samantha Cooper With just one patient, Sutherland didn’t need the blessing of any regulators. Hydromorphone is already legal, and in Canada, physicians have considerably more autonomy than they do in the US. In fact, Sutherland started dozens more patients on hydromorphone without seeking any government approvals. But as Cooper began to wean herself off of street drugs, Sutherland decided to turn her small-scale experiment into a broader study. She worked with the regulators in British Columbia that govern physicians and pharmacists to develop a set of guidelines, and now she’s treating about 100 patients at a time as part of a five-year research project, which will track their long-term results. On a typical morning outside the Molson, a handful of Sutherland’s patients will gather by a side door in the alley, buzzing the doorbell until it’s time to be let in. When the doors open, they take their seats at the metal tables inside and wait for one of the nurses to bring them a clean syringe, preloaded with liquid hydromorphone. Patients who opt, instead, for hydromorphone tablets, which are far less expensive than the liquid stuff, get a syringe and a premade slurry of ground-up pills, served in a sterile cooker. The overdose prevention sites are staffed with nurses like Leah Bennett. Samantha Cooper Some patients inject themselves intravenously, while others let the nurse deliver it like a flu shot to the shoulder. This gives patients a longer-lasting, less euphoric effect. Afterward, the patients sit around, sipping coffee and munching on muffins, catching up on each others’ lives as a brown and white dog named Sage sniffs at their feet. After 15 minutes, they’re cleared to leave. A few hours after that, they return for a second shot, and the cycle repeats. The scene inside feels like a hybrid between a chemo floor and a community center. It’s staffed at all times by two nurses and a mental health worker as well as a group of peers who are all either former or current drug users. It’s far narrower and more medicalized than anything Tyndall has suggested, but for roughly 300 people who have cycled through the program, it’s at least safer than the street—making it a sort of middle ground between opioid-dispensing vending machines and the broader black market. “It’s not like going to a drug dealer,” BeeLee, one of the patients who asked to be called by her nickname, tells me, as a nurse plunges a syringe into her arm muscle. “I’m going to a health care facility that’s run by nurses and doctors, and they’re giving me my medication for the day.” An onsite nurse at The Molson Overdose Prevention Site crushes a Dilaudid pill. She then transfers the crushed Dilaudid to a cooker. Water is added to the crushed Dilaudid. The nurse hands the crushed Dilaudid and a syringe to a patient. Patients filter the crushed Dilaudid before transferring the slurry to a syringe. Dennis, a peer supervisor, sits at one of the clinic stations. When patients prepare the Dilaudid, they use a cooker, a syringe, a filter, and water. Once used, the supplies used to inject the Dilaudid are safely disposed. Before she started the program, BeeLee says she was afraid she was about to become a statistic. She had started using Oxycontin when she was 28, after a doctor prescribed it for her fibromyalgia pain. At the time, she was married with two kids and had a thriving career as a lab technician. While she had always used drugs, she describes herself as a “functional” drug user. It wasn’t until she started using Oxycontin that, she says, “something switched in my brain.” When she got cut off from the pills, BeeLee moved on to heroin. She left her family for a man who also used drugs, and together they fell into street life, shoplifting in vast quantities to pay for their addiction. By the time she was 36, BeeLee had a criminal record and had been homeless for a stint. At times, she turned to selling drugs. She too had been in and out of detox and treatment programs more than a dozen times since 2012. She too had tried opioid replacements like methadone and suboxone and had worked the 12 steps through Narcotics Anonymous. But by December 2018, at the age of 44, she was still using fentanyl, and friends and family had repeatedly found her unconscious. “I was like ‘I’m going to die, and you’re not helping me,’” she remembers telling a nurse at her doctor’s office. That nurse soon found BeeLee a spot in Sutherland’s program. The day we met in February, BeeLee told me as a point of pride that she was going on her 18th day without using street drugs. By April, she'd been off them so long, she'd stopped counting. The results of Sutherland’s research won’t be published for some time, but anecdotally, at least, she says she’s seen a change in the people she treats. Cooper has felt the difference too. “I’m not scrounging or worried about where I’m going to get my next shot, or how I’m going to get it, or where I’m going to get the next $10 to get my fix,” she says. For Tyndall, these sorts of stories are encouraging but ultimately overshadowed by the number of people dying. What the country (if not the continent) needs, he says, are options that more than a few dozen people at a time can access without a doctor present. To some extent, Sutherland agrees. Despite her belief that doctors like herself are an important part of the equation, she has also co-authored a paper for the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use, calling for the creation of heroin buyer’s clubs, where people who use drugs can pay for access to a stable supply of clean heroin—sort of like joining a tightly regulated food co-op. Because people would have to buy the heroin at market rates, she says, they’d be less likely to sell it all over again than if they got the drugs for free. Christy Sutherland, a family and addiction doctor and medical director for the Portland Hotel Society, runs an experimental program treating about 100 drug users with hydromorphone. Samantha Cooper Tyndall admits there are some academic turf wars playing out through these proposals, as researchers compete for public and regulatory approval. Sutherland, for her part, politely declined to comment on Tyndall’s vending machine idea, as did Evan Wood, her co-author on the buyer’s club paper, who studied Insite at Tyndall’s side all those years ago. Yet at a time when so many people need help, it’s hard to view these minor skirmishes and efforts to out-innovate each other as anything other than evidence of progress. If Tyndall or Sutherland lived south of the Canadian border, they’d be competing to accomplish a lot less.

On a rainy day nearly 5,000 miles southeast of the Downtown Eastside, Pennsylvania’s former governor Ed Rendell ambled up to a podium inside the Washington, DC, headquarters of the Cato Institute, with a red, white, and blue pin affixed to his lapel. In front of him sat dozens of health care workers, academics, and local officials who had gathered for a daylong discussion on harm reduction, or as the pamphlets being distributed in the hallway put it, “shifting from a war on drugs to a war on drug-related deaths.” Earlier that morning, the crowd had sat rapt as Darwin Fisher, a program manager at Insite, told the story of the supervised consumption site’s struggle for survival, the thousands of lives that had been saved there, and the dozens of scientific studies that helped prove its value to the government and the courts. When it came time for Rendell to speak, the consummate politician started with perhaps the only joke appropriate for a day of talks about overdose deaths. “After hearing the first two speakers, I am compelled to act upon an urge I had after the 2016 election,” Rendell said. “That’s to move to Canada.” As a board member for the Philadelphia nonprofit Safehouse, which is trying to open the country’s first supervised injection site, Rendell now finds himself in much the same position as Insite’s supporters did more than a decade ago. Only now, the stakes in Philadelphia are even higher than they were in Vancouver, back when Dean Wilson and his comrades marched that coffin into City Hall. More than 1,000 people in Philadelphia have died of overdoses every year for the last two years. The vast majority of those deaths involved fentanyl. The crisis has prompted city officials, including the mayor and district attorney, to openly back the idea of supervised injection; some have even made the trip to Vancouver to tour Insite for themselves. They’re not alone: Cities including Boston, Denver, New York, San Francisco, and Seattle are all considering the possibility of opening similar sites, as the US loses more than 70,000 people a year to overdoses. The plans these cities are proposing are far less expansive than what Tyndall is requesting. Safehouse wouldn’t give people drugs or even any paraphernalia—just a clean space and some supervision. Even so, the US Justice Department is working overtime to stop these efforts before they start. In America, the so-called Crack House Statute makes it a felony to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance.” Passed in 1986, it was intended to prevent crack-den proprietors from making a profit on people who use drugs. Now the Trump administration is wielding it as a weapon against activists trying to keep those same people alive. In February, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, stating that “it does not matter that Safehouse claims good intentions,” and asking the court to declare that supervised injection sites are in fact illegal. Safehouse, meanwhile, contends it wouldn’t violate the Crack House Statute, because supervised injection sites are created “for the exclusive purpose of” providing medical care, not unlawful drug use, as the law states. Both sides are awaiting a decision, which could have a ripple effect on harm-reduction efforts across the country. No matter how the judge rules, Rendell said that Safehouse’s board is determined to open. “I think we’re going to win,” he added. “But if we lose, we’re going forward,” even if that means risking jail time. Of course, that wouldn’t be a great look for the feds, Rendell explains; one of Safehouse’s advisors is a Roman Catholic Sister of Mercy. But Vancouver’s example suggests that sometimes it takes a little civil disobedience to prove the effectiveness of these interventions. “You have all these people saying ‘This is bad. This is going to happen,' and you’re like, ‘Actually ... we saved 100 lives this week,’” Lysyshyn says. “The more you have that data, the less they can tell you why you can’t do it.” That was the case in Canada, at least. But the US government’s battle against Safehouse squares with the overarching, tough-on-crime approach the Trump administration has taken regarding the overdose crisis. In promoting draconian immigration policies, the president repeatedly has cited the opioid crisis as one reason for the crackdown. In speeches, Trump has openly expressed admiration for countries that sentence drug dealers to death. Meanwhile, members of his administration have pointed to Vancouver as a symbol of harm reduction’s alleged failures. In an op-ed for The New York Times last year, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein denounced the concept of supervised injection sites, writing that they “destroy the surrounding community” by bringing drug dealers and violence to the area. As proof, he quoted a Redmond, Washington, city council member, who visited the Downtown Eastside and called it “a war zone” with “drug-addled, glassy-eyed people strewn about” and “active drug dealing going on in plain sight.” It’s a revisionist history that ignores much of the evidence Tyndall and others have worked hard to produce over the years. That’s not to say this is an inaccurate description of the Downtown Eastside. It’s just that it was accurate long before supervised injection sites existed there. Insite opened in the neighborhood explicitly because it was in rough shape. The people who pushed for it never promised they would do anything other than save people’s lives, and they’ve held up that end of the bargain. Insite alone has intervened in 6,440 overdoses without a single death. That doesn’t even include the thousands more people who’ve been saved at the other overdose prevention sites that have opened since then. At the same time, it’s hard to blame Rosenstein and the Redmond city council member for connecting the dots between the Downtown Eastside’s squalid condition and the city’s progressive drug policies. Tyndall says he’s taken other American visitors interested in harm reduction on much the same tour that he took me on and struggled to explain how, while all these lives were being saved, things were getting so much worse. “They’re like ‘This is it? You’re telling me this is progress?’” Tyndall recounts. You can blame the fact that there haven’t been enough sites or that the drugs themselves are still illegal. But the inconvenient truth that sometimes gets lost in the conversation about harm reduction is that drugs can do a lot of harm all on their own. Yes, fentanyl may be what kills people, and yes, the criminalization of drugs may be what’s landing many of them in jail. Opioids have devastated Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside neighborhood. Samantha Cooper The seven-block district contains one of North America’s densest populations of injection drug users. Samantha Cooper But even if no one winds up dead or behind bars, using drugs can still torpedo a career, break up a family, and drain a bank account. Harm reduction isn’t synonymous with harm elimination, and activists pushing for supervised injection sites in the US would be wise not to hang too many hopes on what a single clinic can do. These interventions, at the most basic level, are a last resort designed explicitly to keep people who use drugs alive. That means they may continue to live in a cycle of addiction, and it means they may continue to look like “drug-addled, glassy-eyed” masses on the streets of Vancouver or Philadelphia or San Francisco. That’s not pretty to watch, and it’s natural to seek different results. It’s also natural to want to know how many people are getting and staying sober. And if that number isn’t charting up and to the right, it’s natural to wonder, well, what was the point? If any one of those people were someone you loved, the point would be abundantly clear. As an oft-cited motto in harm-reduction circles goes: You can’t get sober if you’re already dead.
Bremen – Politische Nachhilfe für Frank Magnitz (66)!



Fünf Wochen vor der Bürgerschaftswahl hat sich der AfD-Spitzenkandidat einen peinlichen Aussetzer geleistet.



In einem Interview gefragt, welches Bremer Bauwerk er „als Bausünde wegzaubern" würde, antwortete er: „Das Rathaus. Ich finde es nicht schön“.



Wie bitte? Unser Rathaus, gebaut zwischen 1405 und 1409, denkmalgeschützt und Unesco Weltkulturerbe: Eine Bau-Sünde?

Zum Verwechseln ähnlich... Bremens Rathaus (links) und die Bürgerschaft (rechts) Foto: Verena Hornung



Auf die Verwunderung der „Radio Bremen"-Moderatoren ruderte Magnitz zurück. Er habe „nicht das Alte, sondern das, was gegenübersteht" gemeint. Also das Gebäude der Bürgerschaft. Der AfD-Mann: „Das ist für mich wie das zweite Rathaus..."



Ja nee, ist klar!



Immerhin eine Gewinnerin gibt es bei der Sache: Bürgerschaftspräsidentin Antje Grotheer (52, SPD). „Wie heißt nochmal das Haus, in dem das Parlament tagt?" fragte sie cool bei Twitter – und postete den Link das-zweite-rathaus.de.



Das Haus hatte sich blitzschnell die Rechte an der Domain gesichert und leitet nun von da auf die offizielle Seite der Bürgerschaft weiter.






4th Update, Sunday 10:17 AM Writethru: With chart As we were the first to say yesterday very early in the morning, it’s the lowest Easter weekend at the box office in well over a decade – actually, since 2003, per ComScore this morning (when it hit $107.1M), with the last three days totaling $110.8M in US/Canada ticket sales. This despite the fact that New Line’s $9M James Wan horror production, The Curse of La Llorona, over-performed and kicked its $15M-$17M tracking to the tune of $26.5M.

This weekend’s domestic B.O. is also off 12% from the comparative three-day frame a year ago ($125.55M), which was also the pre-period prior to Avengers: Infinity War debuting.

All of this speaks to the power of Avengers: Endgame, or specifically, a hands-down, must-see Marvel movie on the calendar: no major studio wants to program a tentpole and spend a $100M-plus global P&A to launch a movie in the weekend preceding a Marvel movie, even if it’s during a lucrative holiday period at the box office. At least that’s the attitude this year.

True, folks may curb their movie ticket spending at the B.O. in the weekend prior to a Marvel or Star Wars movie, but c’mon — it’s Easter weekend, and three-quarters of the nation’s K-12 schools were on break. Previous Easter weekends, when Furious 7 and Batman v. Superman played, have amassed north of $224M. Not to mention, studios have proven before that two tentpoles, launched next to each other in subsequent weekends, can live in the marketplace at the same time.

Surely among some in the industry and exhibition, there’s a “So what?” attitude about this weekend at the B.O.: Next weekend will probably deliver one of the biggest thee-days of all-time at the domestic box office with Endgame.

Nonetheless, the 2019 domestic box office according to ComScore still lags greatly behind last year at -16% with $2.9 billion through today, a difference of $568M. Endgame isn’t going to fix that gaping hole in just one weekend of its opening; it could take well into June before we make up that difference. Much of this has to do with how pics were dated between last year and this year. Then again, there were some movies like Universal/BVI’s Glass and Fox’s Alita which didn’t work as they were intended to do. Marvel launched Black Panther in mid February last year and amassed $688M by the time when Avengers: Infinity War opened. Compare this towhich just became the 7th Marvel move to crossin its 45th day of release today. The pic saw a 6% spike in business despite shedding 322 screens as fans prep for Endgame next weekend. Captain America: Civil War took 44 days to hit $400M, Iron Man 3 reached that threshold in 47 days.

Warner Bros. hit the demos they were expecting for La Llorona with 49% Hispanic audiences and 30% females under 25, along with 26% men under 25. She played best in the West and South-West, with 17 of the pic’s top 20 runs coming from these regions. The pic is safe counter-programming at a minimal estimated domestic P&A spend around $35M-$40M, which can be the second choice next weekend when Avengers: Endgame potentially sets another opening weekend record, beating Infinity War‘s $257.6M.

Llorona also didn’t ding New Line’s own Shazam! that much. In his third weekend, that film is expected to gross $17.3M, a very sweet -29% hold in second place at 4,183 theaters. CinemaScore audiences gave Llorona a B-, which is less than both Annabelles’ Bs and higher than The Nun‘s C. PostTrak gave the pic a low 2 1/2 stars and a 48% definite recommend. Friday made $11.8M (including $2.75M Thursday night previews), and the Michael Chaves-directed movie was frontloaded with a Saturday that was down 26% with $8.7M. The 13-17 set who were able to get into Llorona liked the movie the most at 79% positive, but they only repped 12% of the crowd. Caucasians came out at 27%, African Americans at 11%, and Asians at 8%.

Says social media analytics corp RelishMix about Llorona, “There are a lot of fans sharing stories of this legend and how it was an integral part of their childhood, with some being told by friends, others by their Grandma — the point is it’s seen as a legend that just might be true. That said, James Wan’s contribution and the scary clips from the film have horror fans convinced this effort is worth seeing in theaters. Another element that fans like is that the movie is rated R, which many horror fans see as a good sign. One of the best things La Llorona has going for it is the simple suggestion or rumor that it might be related to the Conjuring universe.” Llorona is not directly connected to Conjuring, as it doesn’t involve, nor is it connected to, the paranormal investigators, the Warrens.

RelishMix considers Llorona‘s social media universe at over 137M very strong for a horror genre. Broken out, that’s 33.8M Facebook Fans, 14M Facebook video views, 9.2M Twitter Followers, 66.1M YouTube views and 14M Instagram followers. Video materials both organic and bought are at 44:1, well above the typical horror film’s 25:1 viral rate. Similarly, the average daily views for Llorona‘s top YouTube clips are coming in at 50.3K, once again exceeding the benchmark of 27.7K for the genre.

Notable Llorona materials on social, per RelishMix, include a number of YouTube influencer clips sponsored by Warner Bros. The Buzzfeed Unsolved Network posted a clip that was 24 minutes long and earned 3.3M views , which called out the movie in the description to the Channel’s 2.4M subscribers. Similarly, there are fan-posted clips about the Llorona legend, which have clocked well over 1M views . “This campaign has featured a real push and pull from sponsored WB clips and organic videos from fans, which is clearly driving the high YT views heading towards open.”

In addition, there was this clip from Glam & Gore (which counts 3.5M subscribers) that features a makeup tutorial and a look at the film, followed by the host trying not to cry and ruin the makeup.

Disney/Fox’s faith-baseddrewover the 3-day andsince its Wednesday opening at 2,824. While that’s slightly lower than the $14.8M 3-day and $18.3M made by DeVon Franklin’s Miracles From Heaven, it’s not a disaster off the pic’s estimated $14M production cost. These faith-based titles have a home entertainment life for their demos. As typical with faith-based films, they earn great exits based on their demos, and PostTrak shows 49% females over 25 being the dominant quad, and 51% over 35, with an overall 4 1/2 stars and a very notable 69% definite recommend. Overall audience diversity breakdown was 48% Caucasian, 28% Hispanic, 15% African American, & 9% Asian/Other. Breakthrough played strong in the Mid-West and South, with the top 10 theaters in that area. Missouri and Tennessee had seven of the top ten runs. Meanwhile, anti-abortion film Unplanned from PureFlix in its fourth weekend made $650K off 839 theaters for a running $17.2M cume.

RelishMix says that the social media universe for Breakthrough “is exceptional” at 161.5M across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, with positive word of mouth into the weekend from the faith-based crowd. For context, the next largest SMU RelishMix has seen in recent history for a faith-based pic was for 2017’s The Shack at 89.4M. Big social media movers here for the film are This Is Us star Chrissy Metz with 1.7M, who is pushing a 7:30pm free screening at the Burbank, CA AMC 16 today. “The campaign also benefited from Metz’s duet with Carrie Underwood at the Country Music Awards last Sunday of ‘I’m Standing With You’, which has added 11 clips to its social media push. the “earned” bucket of social media. While it’s common to have a film support a live broadcast to build awareness, it’s such a bonus to have one of the movie’s stars actually perform there – and reap the benefits on social.”

Universal’s Little in its second weekend eased -45% with $8.45M and a 10-day take of $29.3M.

Disneynature’s Penguins plopped outside the top 10 in the No. 12 spot with aroundover three days andfor the five days at 1,815. Even though much isn’t expected from these nature docs at the B.O. Penguins is the worst opening for a Disneynature doc ever. 2012 Chimpanzee‘s $10.6M posted the biggest three-day in the nature canon, and the previous low before Penguins was Monkey Kingdom at $4.5M in 2015. The last Disneynature movie to open over 5-days was Penguins co-director Alastair Fothergill’s Earth in April 2009 which posted a $8.8M FSS at 1,804 theaters and a $14.4M five-day opening.

As we mentioned the pic nabbed an A CinemaScore, however PostTrak exits were moderate at 78% positive and a 52% definite recommend from the general audience while kids under 12 gave it a 77% positive and 60% definite recommend. Friday’s gross was around $900K. Not that much is ever expected from these nature docs at the box office; there’s goodwill vibe to these big-screen presentations. Those who showed up to Penguins were 55% female with 52% under 25 and 35% under 17. Diversity demos were comprised of 63% Caucasian, 23% Hispanic, 11% Asian/Other, and 3% African American.

Bleecker Street’s expansion of Teen Spirit from 4 to 696 theaters earned an estimated $250,5K in weekend 2 for a running total of $305,3K.

It Follows director David Robert Mitchell has the comedy crime drama Under the Silver Lake from A24 at two locations and it minted a theater average of $20K or $40K over three days. Starring Andrew Garfield, Riley Keough and Topher Grace, pic follows a guy (Garfield) who meets a mysterious woman in his apartment’s swimming pool. She disappears and he embarks on a quest to find her across Los Angeles. Rotten Tomatoes is 53% Rotten. NY and LA runs were at the Angelika & ArcLight Hollywood. At the latter, the pic was the top grossing film in the complex while at the Angelika we hear ti was soft.

2ND UPDATE, Friday 1:12 PM: Here’s what we know at this point in time and we’ll have further updates: New Line’s The Curse of La Llorona is eyeing a $9.1 million-plus Friday for a $19M-$20M opening at 3,372 theaters The studio’s Shazam! will settle for second for the Easter frame at $15.7M (a 36% dip), at 4,183 theaters, off a third Friday of $6.3M and a running total by Sunday of $119.7M.

Since Llorona is an R-rated horror, expect this movie to play into the late hours, natch. Llorona‘s production cost before P&A was a thrifty $9M net, hence a solid result here. That $9.1M today includes last night’s $2.75M previews.

Llorona‘s Friday bests Escape Room‘s first day plus previews ($7.6M), and it’s just under Pet Sematary‘s $9.9M and right on the money with Lights Out‘s $9.1M.

The last time in recent memory New Line made a genre pic on a shoestring budget was 2014’s Annabelle, made for $6.5M before P&A, which opened to a huge $37.1M and finaled at $84.2M domestic, $257M global.

Meanwhile, Disney-Fox’s Breakthrough is seeing an estimated $3.5M today for a three-day total of $10M, and a five-day cume of $13.5M.

Disney will own spots four and six as well, respectively, for the frame, with Captain Marvel ($7M, -18% and $398M cume) and Dumbo ($5.9M, -37%, and a $100.3M).

Universal’s Little is seeing a second weekend of $6.8M, -56%, for a 10-day total of $27.7M in fifth place.

Disneynature’s Penguins is eyeing $650K today, $1.77M over FSS and $2.7M over five days.

PREVIOUSLY, Friday 7:32 AM: Before Avengers: Endgame snatches away the under-25 demo next weekend, Warner Bros is looking to hook them over the Easter weekend with New Line’s James Wan-produced horror pic The Curse of La Llorona, which made $2.75 million last night from previews that started at 6 PM.

That figure is slightly higher than the $2.3M Paramount’s Pet Sematary posted in previews two weeks ago, as well as Escape Room‘s $2.3M Thursday night back on January 3 and the Wan-produced 2016 horror pic Lights Out ($1.8M). On the Thursday after Labor Day last year, The Nun previews rang up a record Thursday night for The Conjuring universe with $5.4M off 7 PM showtimes.

Llorona is billed as being from The Conjuring producers Wan and The Nun EP and Annabelle scribe Gary Dauberman. It is not a part of that genre series universe, but Warners is hoping those credits on the Llorona one sheet will draw fans of that franchise. Even though Annabelle priest Father Perez (Tony Amendola) makes a cameo, Llorona is not part of The Conjuring series. (Essentially, anything that’s part of that horror universe specifically involves, or is connected to, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren.)

Tracking has Llorona opening between $15M-$17M, making a run at Shazam!‘s two-weekend streak at No. 1. It wouldn’t come as a surprise if Llorona hits $20M-plus given Wan’s name on the pic and the fact that it’s Good Friday, a huge moviegoing day with 74% K-12 schools off and another 29% from colleges. As such, most pics in the top 20 yesterday saw gains over Wednesday.

Among Wan’s producer credits, he has had only one movie open below $20M, and that was Saw VI ($14.1M). In regards to Llorona‘s Thursday night comps, both Pet Sematary and Lights Out continued on to posts three-days that were north of $20M with $24.5M and $21.6M, respectively. Also, Monday boasts 37% K-12 off and 8% colleges on break, so there should be an extra B.O. cushion on Easter Sunday.

Among regular releases yesterday, Shazam! led all titles with $2.55M, +33% from Wednesday for a two-week running total of $104M. The DC superhero is expected to post a third weekend around $15M.

Disney’s Fox faith-based releaseheld quite well in its second day earningat 2,764 in the No. 2 spot, -18%, for a running total since its Wednesday opening of $3.4M. The DeVon Franklin-produced movie is pacing very close to the $3.55M two-day running total of his March 2016 faith-based title Miracles From Heaven, which made $18.3M in its first five days of release, $14.8M over Friday-Sunday. Breakthrough carries an estimated net production cost of $14M before P&A.

Disney’s Captain Marvel was No. 3 yesterday with an estimated $1.3M, +37% from Wednesday, for a running total through six weeks of $390.9M.

Universal’s Little was fourth yesterday with an estimated $1.23M, +19% over Wednesday, for a first-week total of $20.9M.

Disneynature’s Penguins fell outside Thursday’s top 10 in the No. 11 spot with $456,000 in its second day of release, -9% from Wednesday, for a running total of $956K at 1,815 theaters.
Earlier by Ann Coulter: Hail President Javanka!

Even after Trump won the presidency, Jared Kushner was embarrassed by his father-in-law, according to Vicky Ward's terrific new book, Kushner, Inc.: Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

In a speech to hundreds of New York bankers and businessmen on December 16, 2016, Jared admitted that Trump was "easy to hate from afar." But not to worry, he said, Trump wouldn't be keeping his campaign promises—especially on immigration.

One banker who heard the speech was appalled, shocked by Jared's arrogance in thinking he could "control" the president.

Joke's on him. Turns out Jared was right. He does control Trump.

And what a blessing that's been.

It was Jared's idea to fire FBI Director James Comey. If Trump hadn't followed that advice, there would have been no independent counsel.

It was also Jared and Ivanka's idea to hire Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. (Ivanka was adamant, saying Flynn gets "anything he wants.")

If Trump hadn't hired Manafort and Flynn, the independent counsel investigation would have been over in about a week.

Even Trump's opponents warned him about the man Javanka said should have anything he wants. Ward reports:

"President Barack Obama gave Trump two pieces of advice: One was that the biggest problem he would face as president was the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. The second was a warning against hiring Flynn: 'He'll cause you nothing but problems.'"

Trump's supposedly loyal kids give him worse advice than the ex-president whom Trump tormented during his presidency.

Even Trump's plethora of Goldman Sachs aides were horrified by Jared's decision to fire the FBI director just as congressional Democrats were gearing up their Russian collusion nonsense.

When Goldman Sachs alum Dina Powell got wind of Comey's coming dismissal, she told Jared that firing the Director would be "a huge political mistake." A self-assured Jared brushed her off, saying, "No, no, this is what should be done. The guy is not on our team."

At least Jared's string of disastrous decisions hasn't harmed his self-confidence. The hits keep coming!

Jared wanted Chris Christie fired. He was fired. (Jared insists this had absolutely nothing to do with Christie being the U.S. attorney who put Jared's criminal father in prison.) All of Christie's proposed hires were jettisoned along with him. Whoever they were, they couldn't be worse than Trump's actual White House staff.

Jared brought in Goldman Sachs' Gary Cohn to be Trump's National Economic Council director—which would be like Malia Obama demanding that Obama hire me as his White House economic adviser.

Still, I've got mixed feelings on Cohn. On one hand, he is credited with blocking Trump's promise to end the carried interest loophole (and many other items on the MAGA agenda).

But on the other, Cohn is all over Ward's book, trashing both Jared and Ivanka, e.g.:

"Cohn felt Jared was not looking at the practical challenges," Ward writes. He "was more impressed by famous names."

Cohn also sneered that Ivanka "thinks she's going to be president of the United States." To her, "this is like the Kennedys, the Bushes, and now the Trumps."

Trump should have read Jared the snake poem before he hired Cohn. ("You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.")

Early in the administration, Jared demanded that Trump endorse the widely unpopular establishment Republican, Luther Strange, in the 2017 special Senate race in Alabama to replace Jeff Sessions.

Like night follows day, Trump suffered a humiliating defeat. It turned out Alabamians preferred anyone to Strange. First they voted for a nut in the primary, and then for a Democrat in the general.

Always trust Jared.

No one but Jared could have turned over Sessions' U.S. Senate seat in the reddest state in the Union to a Democrat. Oddsmakers would have said it was impossible.

But with Jared's sound counsel, Trump did it. He took Sessions out of the Senate, then delivered the seat to a Democrat. Trump is like a guy who breaks up a marriage—and then dumps the wife.

Jared and Ivanka were also the brain trust behind hiring Anthony Scaramucci.

"Ivanka brought Scaramucci into the White House without telling anyone," Ward says. She went to her father and said, "He'd be a great communications director."

Scaramucci was the White House communications director for a glorious 11 days, before imploding in an obscenity-laced rant to The New Yorker.

In addition to Javanka's personnel decisions on Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Chris Christie, Michael Flynn, Luther Strange, Gary Cohn and Anthony Scaramucci, Javanka wanted John Kelly made chief of staff, believing he would be loyal to them. When that turned out not to be the case, they decided to get rid of Kelly. He was gone.

They wanted Steve Bannon fired. He was fired.

At this rate, it's only a matter of time before Jared gets rid of Trump. No wonder the media like him so much.

Ukraine's new president could regain control over the separatist-controlled east of his country within months and get cheap gas and major investment from Russia if he repairs ties with Moscow, the Kremlin's closest ally in Ukraine said. Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent figure in Ukraine's Russia-leaning opposition, outlined the prospect in an interview before a presidential election runoff in Ukraine on Sunday which polls show political novice Volodymyr Zelenskiy should easily win.

He said the Kremlin was keen to know more about Zelenskiy, a 41-year-old Russian-speaking TV comedian who has no political experience, to understand if he is someone it could do a deal with, something it failed to do with incumbent Petro Poroshenko who polls show will be soundly defeated by Zelenskiy. "They don't have any expectations in Moscow," he said. "They want to see what happens afterward, who will be in his (Zelenskiy's) entourage, and what he will do and with whom." A Ukrainian citizen, Medvedchuk does not represent Russia, but his words carry weight due to his close friendship with President Vladimir Putin and track record as a go-between between the two nations. Medvedchuk said he had known Putin for 19 years, that the Russian leader is godfather to his daughter, and that he had held talks with Putin in Moscow as recently as two weeks ago.

The Kremlin has made clear it will be glad to see the back of Poroshenko but has not commented on Zelenskiy, saying only that it is watching candidates' statements closely and hopes any new president can implement a peace deal on Donbass, eastern Ukraine, which has been under separatist control since 2014. When asked about Medvedchuk's advice for Ukraine's new president on Friday, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, said he greatly respected Medvedchuk, calling him "very active" and "important" when it came to his humanitarian work as an intermediary between Moscow and Kiev. Peskov, who confirmed Medvedchuk's recent meeting with Putin, said Ukraine didn't need to strike a specific deal with Putin or Moscow, but did need take steps to build mutually beneficial relations with Russia. When asked what expectations the Kremlin had of Zelenskiy, Peskov said: "We would always like to hope for the best. Of course we want to hope that the person who is elected Ukraine's president will not be from the party of war. And we want to hope that this person will take a different perspective on relations between Ukraine and Russia.” Testing the waters Medvedchuk, who said he had only met Zelenskiy once "eight or nine years ago" and had no contacts with him, appears to be testing the waters on Moscow's behalf. Medvedchuk has brokered prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine and held talks in Moscow last month with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about gas prices. At that meeting, he said he and an ally secured a pledge of a 25 percent discount for Russian gas if Kiev agreed to resume direct gas purchases from energy giant Gazprom instead of via European countries as it has done since the end of 2015. Russia's main focus is returning separatist-held Donbass to Kiev on its own terms. This could help Moscow win some relief from sanctions imposed by the European Union over its 2014 annexation of Crimea and its backing for the pro-Russian Donbass uprising.

The Trump campaign has been sending out fundraising texts to supporters with the goal of raising $1 million. A text sent out on Friday afternoon put the fundraising haul at more than $1.1 million, just a day after the release of the report.

The Trump campaign raised $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, or as much as the top two Democratic presidential contenders combined.

The president ended the quarter with more than $40 million in the bank.

The Mueller report did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump officials and Russia. The special counsel detailed 10 episodes it examined as part of an obstruction of justice investigation, but decided neither to implicate nor exonerate the president on that front.

Trump has called the report a “complete and total exoneration.”
Two weeks between episodes is an eternity! Why does it take so long?

. . .

We appreciate listeners wanting to hear more episodes more often, but please keep in mind that producing a podcast from inside a prison (without internet or phone access) takes much more time than producing one on the outside. This has been a learning process for all involved, and while our systems are improving, it’s still a ton of work to get each episode publish-ready.



Is Ear Hustle censored by San Quentin State Prison (SQSP) authorities?

. . .

Every Ear Hustle episode is approved by prison administration as a matter of policy concerning outgoing media of any form from San Quentin. The administration has shown great support for Ear Hustle, and we see no indication that they will make it difficult for us to pursue the podcast we’ve outlined from the start, sharing stories about the day to day life in prison. We are not concerned about this need for approval compromising the content or integrity of the show.



Are the inside producers getting paid?

. . .

Ear Hustle was created and is produced as a labor of love. All monies earned through sponsorships and donations are invested directly back into the project to cover the cost of production, including paying Nigel for her role in co-producing, co-hosting and shepherding the show from San Quentin to the public. To date, revenue does not cover the entire cost of producing the show; PRX absorbs the extra expenses.



In following institutional protocol from CDCR, Ear Hustle is not allowed to directly pay the men working on the show. Beyond monetary compensation, the men involved with Ear Hustle production are learning marketable skills that can help them job search once they leave prison.



Additionally, once Ear Hustle is earning steady revenue, we intend to donate a portion of this to the Prison University Project, the program that Nigel first worked with when she began volunteering at San Quentin in 2011.



I heard that Earlonne was released from San Quentin last year. Where can I find out more?

. . .

It's true! The day before Thanksgiving 2018, then-California Governor Jerry Brown commuted Earlonne's sentence, and Earlonne was released from San Quentin on Nov. 30, 2018. You can hear more about it in this bonus episode.



So what is Earlonne's role on the show now?

. . .

Earlonne is now employed by PRX as a full-time producer with Ear Hustle, and is busy reporting on re-entry stories and daily life for formerly incarcerated people, while also documenting his own experiences. He is still co-hosting these portions of the show, with Nigel.



How can I collaborate with Ear Hustle?

. . .

Thank you so much for the interest, but to be honest, most likely, you can’t. It’s not possible to bring collaborators into San Quentin State Prison regularly, nor to connect via internet or phone with the men inside. Besides the logistical challenges of collaborating, while there are many people on the outside pursuing excellent journalism and storytelling about prison culture and reform, with Ear Hustle we are committed to producing stories from and giving voice to the men on the inside. And while we are expanding to include stories of re-entry in season four, we are not, at this time, taking pitches related to this subject.



In general, due to the unique nature of our production, we do not respond to outside requests or pitches for material.



Do you have transcripts of the episodes?

. . .

Yes! You can find transcripts of each episode on our transcripts page.



How can I support Ear Hustle?

. . .

How can I write a letter directly to the guys who tell their stories in Ear Hustle?

. . .

Prison rules prohibit Nigel from passing on any letters, but you can find all the information you'll need — an inmate's CDCR (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation) number and the prison address — yourself.



You can locate any inmate's CDCR number on the CDCR website, and find San Quentin’s address and instructions on their site, as well.



And you'll find the names of the men featured in our stories on each episode page, in the show notes.



Can Ear Hustle pass along my message to one of the guys featured in an episode?

. . .

Sorry, but we’re not able to relay messages, discuss or speculate about any activity within the San Quentin facility.



How can I write a letter to an inmate at another prison?

. . .

It's great that you want to start writing letters to prisoners! Unfortunately, we can’t provide guidance on specific pen pal programs, because we simply don’t know enough about each individual one. We encourage you to do careful research and vet pen pal programs thoroughly before giving them your information.



I love the music featured on Ear Hustle. Is there any way to listen to it outside of the podcast episodes?

. . .

Right now, music featured on Ear Hustle is not available for download outside of podcast episodes. But, you can stream some of the songs from our episodes on the music page of our website.

BANGKOK — The Thai navy on Saturday boarded the floating cabin of a fugitive U.S. bitcoin trader and his Thai girlfriend, both prominent members of the "seasteading" movement who possibly face the death sentence for setting up their offshore home.

Thai authorities have revoked the visa of American citizen Chad Elwartowski and have charged him and his partner, Supranee Thepdet, with violating Thai sovereignty by raising a small cabin on top of a weighted spar 14 nautical miles off the west-coast of the Thai island of Phuket — a popular holiday destination.

The cabin has been promoted as "the world's first seastead" by the group Ocean Builders, part of a movement in tech and libertarian circles to build floating communities beyond the bounds of nations as a way to explore alternative societies and governments.

"I was free for a moment. Probably the freest person in the world," Elwartowski posted on his Facebook on April 13, days before the Thai navy raided his floating home.

Elwartowski, 46, and Supranee, whose Facebook page describes her as a "Bitcoin expert, Trader, Chef, seastead Pioneer," apparently fled after a surveillance plane flew over the cabin the previous day.

The Royal Thai Navy task force had planned on Saturday to seize the structure and tow it back to shore for use as evidence, but by the afternoon it was still studying how to move it without destroying it, the navy said.

In a video posted last month detailing the raising of the floating home, Elwartowski said 20 more similar houses would be up for sale to form a community.

Elwartowski and Ocean Builders say the spar was in international waters and beyond Thailand's jurisdiction. Thai authorities say the structure is in its 200-mile exclusive economic zone and therefore a violation of its sovereignty.

The navy said they have evidence that the floating home was built in a private boatyard in Phuket and said the couple wanted to establish a "permanent settlement at sea beyond the sovereignty of nations by using a legal loophole".

It said the action "reveals the intention of disobeying the laws of Thailand as a littoral state and could lead to a creation of a new state within Thailand's territorial waters... undermining Thailand's national security as well as economic and social interests of maritime nations."

In an email reply to Reuters, Elwartowski referred all questions to the Seasteading Institute and pointed to online statements from the Ocean Builders website.

The group said that the pair, both active bitcoin investors, did not build, invest in or design the floating home themselves but were "volunteers excited about the prospect of living free," documenting their lives as "pioneer seasteaders" off the coast of Phuket.

The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok told Reuters that Elwartowski had engaged a lawyer and was being provided with appropriate assistance.

According to Ocean Builders, the concept of "seasteading" has been discussed for years but the cabin Elwartowski and Supranee lived on was the first attempt at living in what it described as international waters.

Other groups, such as the Seasteading Institute, which was originally backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, have sought to build floating cities with the cooperation of host nations.
Jorgensen wondered if this was a one-off, but the tags recorded similar examples in later years—orcas arrive, and sharks skedaddle. Some orcas also hunt seals, so it’s possible that the sharks are just trying to avoid competition—but that seems improbable, given how quickly they bolt. The more likely explanation is that the most fearsome shark in the world is terrified of orcas.

Read: An unborn baby shark filmed swimming around inside its mother

Killer whales have a friendlier image than great white sharks. (Perhaps because of their respective portrayals in movies: Jaws 2 even begins with the beached carcass of a half-eaten orca.) But orcas are “potentially the more dangerous predator,” says Toby Daly-Engel, a shark expert at the Florida Institute of Technology. “They have a lot of social behaviors that sharks do not, which allows them to hunt effectively in groups, communicate among themselves, and teach their young.”

Combining both brains and brawn, orcas have been known to kill sharks in surprisingly complicated ways. Some will drive their prey to the surface and then karate chop them with overhead tail swipes. Others seem to have worked out that they can hold sharks upside-down to induce a paralytic state called tonic immobility. Orcas can kill the fastest species (makos) and the largest (whale sharks). And when they encounter great whites, a few recorded cases suggest that these encounters end very badly for the sharks.

In October 1997, fishing vessels near Southeast Farallon Island observed a young white shark interrupting a pair of orcas that were eating a sea lion. One of the whales rammed and killed the shark, and the duo proceeded to eat its liver. More recently, after orcas passed by a South African beach, five great-white carcasses washed ashore. All were, suspiciously, missing their liver.

Read: Why whales got so big

A great white’s liver can account for a quarter of its body weight, and is even richer in fats and oils than whale blubber. It’s “one of the densest sources of calories you can find in the ocean,” Jorgensen says. “The orcas know their business, and they know where that organ lies.”

Rather than ripping their prey apart, it seems that orcas can extract livers with surprising finesse, despite lacking arms and hands. No one has observed their technique, but the wounds on otherwise intact carcasses suggest that they bite their victims near their pectoral fins and then squeeze the liver out through the wounds. “It’s like squeezing toothpaste,” Jorgensen says.

An orca, then, is an apex predator’s apex predator. No wonder sharks flee from them. But orcas don’t actually have to kill any great whites to drive them away. Their mere presence—and most likely their scent—is enough. Many predators have similar effects. Their sounds and smells create a “landscape of fear”—a simmering dread that changes the behavior and whereabouts of their prey. The presence of tiger sharks forces dugongs into deeper waters, where food is scarcer but cover is thicker. The mere sound of dogs can keep raccoons off a beach, changing the community of animals that lives in the tide pools.
Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks has shot a special Toy Story video for Irish twins who were born conjoined after learning that they have kept their Woody and Buzz toys with them through 52 operations.

Hassan and Hussein Benhaffaf, who are from Carrigtwohill, Co Cork were born conjoined in December 2009 before being successfully separated the following year.

The pair, who are called the “Little Fighters,” have endured gruelling surgeries and still face ongoing health challenges.

Fantastic Flavours ice cream parlour owner Miceal O'Hurley, who worked in Congress and has links in the film industry, reached out to Tom via his representatives informing him of the boys’ love of Toy Story.

Miceal said he was incredibly touched when the two time Oscar winner shot a short Toy Story video for the youngsters at his home.

He said he wasn't surprised that Hanks went beyond an autographed photo or form letter.

Tom instead matched the Toy Story theme song "You've Got a Friend in Me" to his own actions and choreography.

"We got the video at 3am and my wife Oksana and I sat up in bed in tears. The thoughtfulness. The kindness. The generosity of spirit of his act was extraordinary.

I think what I love about Tom Hanks is that if he wasn't a mega star, and he was the local guy in the hardware store, he would still go out of his way to be a decent person.

"Tom wanted the boys to know that he admires them and wants to be their friend."

Miceal says Hanks put serious thought into the video.

"It's hilarious. The timing of it to the music. The choreography. He has got millions of fans. To think that he recognised two little Irish fans enough to write, direct and produce a little film just for them. They will always have this.

"Next time the boys are feeling low or stuck in a hospital bed they can flip on a video and be reminded that they are special. This is about lifting their spirits."

Tom Hanks collects typewriters and included in the gift for the boys was a hand typed letter with his signature at the end.

In the letter, the Oscar winner joked that he "looks a bit odd" these days. He asked the youngsters not to "be scared" by his appearance in the video.

Miceal says he and his wife are inspired by the resilience of the nine-year-olds and the dedication of their parents, Angie and Azzedine, who have worked extraordinarily hard to give them every opportunity in life.

The twins pictured last year.

The Benhaffaf boys rose to national prominence at birth as their parents fought for their survival via surgery.

However, Miceal stresses in many ways the surgery was just the start of a long journey with the duo having to travel to London on a regular basis for operations.

"It was in all the headlines (when they were born). It was only natural it slipped from our public awareness.

"What people don't realise is the boys' dad, who was an extraordinarily talented chef, had to leave his job to care for the family.

"He and the boys' Mom, Angie, are full-time carers and they also have two other children. They go to London for surgeries. Some things are covered but the out of pocket expenses aren't.

On any given trip it costs them €2,000 to €3,000 out of pocket that they don't get reimbursed. This family face adversity that people don't even realise.

Miceal added that the boys play basketball, climb indoor walls at play centres and are spirited warm kids who light up a room.

"I am proud to know the boys and to call them my friends. They are an extraordinary family. I think we should do something more for these boys."

Hassan and Hussein underwent a 14-hour separation operation at Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital in London in April 2010 under Irish-born surgeon, Dr Edward Kiely.

The twins’ hearts were not joined, but nearly everything else was, including the liver, gut and bladder all of which had to be separated. The boys now each have a prosthetic leg.

The twins' first day of school.

In 2015 they started their first day together at the Educate Together National School in Midleton.

Information in the boy's extensive medical files include details of their cuddly toys, Woody and Buzz, which they bring to every operation.

Mum Angie told The Echo newspaper in Cork last year that the cuddly Woody Toy is getting old now but still attends every surgery.

She joked that "Woody looks how Mummy feels."

It is understood that the team at Great Ormond Street Hospital have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the Benhaffaf boys such is their fondness for them.

Conjoined twins are identical twins whose bodies are joined in utero. A rare phenomenon, the occurrence is estimated to range from 1 in 50,000 births to 1 in 200,000 births.

People are pooping more than ever on the streets of San Francisco

A Community Guide, (declined to give his name) cleans along 6th st. between Mission and Howard streets on Mon. April 23, 2018, in San Francisco, Calif. San Francisco City Hall politicians continue to struggle with a fix for the real public health menace on our sidewalks the dirty needles, tent encampments, feces and foul garbage. less A Community Guide, (declined to give his name) cleans along 6th st. between Mission and Howard streets on Mon.

One of America's wealthiest cities has a huge problem with public poop.

Between 2011 and 2018, San Francisco experienced a massive increase in reported incidents of human feces found on public streets.

In 2011, just over 5,500 reports were logged by the San Francisco Department of Public Works; in 2018, the number increased to more than 28,000.

The government watchdog Open the Books documented the sharp increase over time in a stunning chart, first spotted by the BuzzFeed editor John Paczkowski.

Open the Books/City of San Francisco

Notably, this is a chart of only documented reports — the actual amount of feces on San Francisco's streets is likely even higher than these statistics suggest.

"I will say there is more feces on the sidewalks than I've ever seen growing up here," San Francisco Mayor London Breed told NBC in a 2018 interview. "That is a huge problem, and we are not just talking about from dogs — we're talking about from humans."

San Francisco has struggled with a feces problem for years. The city even employs a "Poop Patrol" that attempts to keep the streets clean and focuses on the Tenderloin neighborhood.

But the problem is bigger than just keeping the streets clean — the issue appears to be related to the city's struggle to accommodate its homeless population amid skyrocketing rent prices and a decreasing supply of affordable housing.

A 2017 survey of San Francisco's homeless population counted nearly 7,500 people living on the street. That population faces limited public resources, and public bathrooms are no exception.

Whether the Poop Patrol is able to reverse the trend on San Francisco's streets remains to be seen, but there's an indication that the crew is a bandage on a problem much bigger than dirty streets.

Frogs, salamanders, and toads across the world are now under attack from a widening range of interacting pathogens that threaten to devastate global amphibian populations.

That is the stark warning of leading zoological experts who will gather this week in London in a bid to establish an emergency plan to save these endangered creatures. “The world’s amphibians are facing a new crisis, one that is caused by attacks by multiple pathogens,” said Professor Trent Garner of the Zoological Society of London, which is hosting the conference. “We desperately need to devise strategies that can protect them.”

Thirty years ago experts noticed that amphibian populations were plunging in different areas of the world as an emerging fungal disease known as chytridiomycosis, or simply chytrid, began taking its toll of frogs and toads. At least 100 species have since been wiped off the face of the planet. These include the golden toad in Costa Rica (Incilius periglenes); the southern gastric-brooding frog of Australia (Rheobatrachus silus); and Arthur’s stubfoot toad (Atelopus arthuri) in Ecuador. Hundreds of other amphibian species have also suffered severe declines – as a result of chytrid infections.

But scientists also know chytrid is not the only cause of the amphibian deaths now occurring around the world. Another pathogen known as the ranavirus, which exists in at least four varieties, has been observed killing amphibians. In addition they found that there are at least two species of chytrid, and within these, many different genetic types.

“The crucial point is that these different pathogens are no longer acting alone,” added Garner. “They are interacting and in combination are killing off more and more amphibians. These interactions are often far worse than the effects of individual pathogens.”

Apart from the straightforward loss of species, reducing amphibian numbers is harmful to the environment because frogs, newts and toads play an important role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. For example, frogs eat mosquitos that spread disease. They also provide food for birds and other animals. In addition, tadpoles chew up algae and so help keep algal blooms at bay. “To date Britain has been pretty lucky,” said Garner. “There have been no recorded mass mortalities as there have been in other countries – at least as far as chytrid infections go.”

However, ranaviruses are a different issue, he added. They have been causing declines in the common frog (Rana temporaria) in the UK but also infect the common toad (Bufo bufo), often with fatal results. As a result, zoologists have asked the public to report sightings of sick or dead amphibians via websites such as Garden Wildlife Health and have also urged people not to move eggs, tadpoles or frogs from pond to pond.

“That way, you avoid spreading infections,” Garner said. “Anything that you can do to reduce pressure on these creatures is important.”

In addition, this week’s conference – Mitigating single pathogen and co-infections that threaten amphibian biodiversity – will try to outline ideas for trying to save amphibians from the multipathogen threats that they now face. “We will be holding a full-day workshop in which we get the very best people in the field – conservationists, zoologists and experts on co-infections together and get them to hammer out the best strategy for dealing with this. Unless we get one, this is going to get a lot worse.”
It is a very upsetting day for BlackBerry users as Emtek Group has told today that the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is going to shut down on 31st May 2019.

For years, BlackBerry was one of the most used services among the list of most popular messaging apps in the world. But sadly, BlackBerry’s fall damaged the BBM audience very badly that it is now going to shut down.

In 2016, Emtek got the licensing right to make BlackBerry Messenger a bigger player in the market but the unwanted ads and games made people lost their interest in the application.

In the latest news, the company has accepted the fact that competing in the messaging industry has become a very tough task. Emtek hadn’t given any statistics of how many people are currently using their services, but as per Telecom data, there were about 63 million users in Indonesia only in January 2018.

As per BBM’s updated FAQ page, User cannot use BBMoji after 31st of May. And Emtek will delete all the user data once and for all within the next 180 days.

Seven days after the 31st of March, BBM users can still download their chats, photos, and videos if they want to keep it. After that, they won’t be any longer available to download as Emtek will remove all the user data from their servers.

Blackberry Messenger will be gone by May 31st. Meanwhile, BlackBerry Enterprise will be publically available on Android store but by the start of 2020, it will be a paid app which will cost you $2.49 for six months.

Max Landis isn’t just a terrible writer and king of the “Rey is a Mary Sue” community. He’s also the subject of several allegations of sexual assault, which should have ended his career back in 2017, and for a while we thought it might, as his Netflix film Bright got a sequel without him attached. However, he’s now back with two new projects that he’s written, including Shadow in the Cloud, starring Chloë Grace Moretz.

Moretz spoke of his involvement in the project as it currently stands by telling the Guardian in an interview, “we’ve completely distanced ourselves from him. We’ve rewritten it several times now. His name is kind of far away from the project. Communication is key and being held accountable is key. It’s a really horrific thing to hear those stories.” She has a similar take on the now-shelved project I Love You, Daddy with known sexual harasser Louis C.K. “I think it should just kind of go away, honestly. I don’t think it’s time for them to have a voice right now.”

I’m glad that the film is now no longer Landis’s brainchild, but given the latest accusations against Landis, it would be even better if this project were shelved, as well. Following the allegations made against him in 2017, the Daily Beast uncovered a Medium post from an anonymous source who alleges that Landis sexually assaulted her while the pair were friends. The author alleges that The Hollywood Reporter was in contact with her and others to run a story on Landis, but shelved it when she and others were hesitant to use their real names. The post has since been deleted.

She told the Daily Beast in an interview that “It was difficult over the last year seeing [Landis’] fans dismiss the allegations as rumor, knowing that at any time I could come forward and provide something concrete. I thought about it all the time, but it gave me so much anxiety. I didn’t want to do something rash that I would regret. Reading those articles this past weekend and realizing that he had ‘won’ despite all that we went through last year, I was done. It needed to come out.”

Look, I know I sound like a broken record, but we’ve got to stop giving these men second chances when there are women who are speaking out against them. First off, this probably means there are other women who just aren’t in a position in which they can speak up, and yet, this woman will still face backlash for coming forward even if her name isn’t attached. Landis’s projects, no matter how rewritten they are, will still be filmed, and therefore, unless there’s some contract tomfoolery, he will still be paid for these projects.

The news of Landis is especially striking on the heels of Bryan Singer’s Bohemian Rhapsody still taking home Oscars, even as the film’s creatives pointedly avoided mentioning him all night. Hollywood can say it stands with #MeToo as much as it wants, but if it continues to allow alleged predators to continue to thrive in the industry, it really does not care about their victims at all.

CLOSE Artwork from Notre Dame, including stained glass windows and Nicolas Coustou's pietà, were safe after firefighters were able to put out the fire. USA TODAY

Notre Dame Cathedral's bees, kept in hives on the historic church's roof, survived the fire earlier this week, the beekeeper says.

"I am so relieved. I saw satellite photos that showed the three hives didn’t burn. I thought they had gone with the cathedral," beekeeper Nicolas Geant told the Associated Press on Friday.

The 180,000 bees live in three hives on Notre Dame's roof as part of an effort since 2013 to help prevent bee die-off.

"I got a call from Andre Finot, the spokesman for Notre Dame, who said there were bees flying in and out of the hives which means they are still alive!" Geant told CNN.

The hives are located on a sacristy roof about 100 feet below the main roof that burned, which allowed them to endure the fire, he told CNN.

'A matter of life': Why Notre Dame didn't completely crumble in the blaze. And why it could take decades to repair.

While the hives are safe, Geant told CNN he still needs to inspect the site.

Bees have no lungs and carbon dioxide in smoke sedates them, according to Geant. European bees don't abandon their hives, and when they sense fire, they "gorge themselves on honey" and protect their queen, he told the AP.

Monday's fire at Notre Dame torched the cathedral's roof, but the structure of the church still stands after firefighters quelled the flames. French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild in five years, though some architecture experts say it may take at least a decade.

Cyber Security Lessons from the U.S. Air Force

Of all the branches in the United States armed services, the Air Force is known to always be at the forefront of information technology, particularly in terms of cybersecurity. Over the next few years, the Air Force will augment its cyber defence systems with advanced cloud protection, real-time alerts and automated responses to security incidents.

The Air Force has realized that the current cybersecurity climate calls for appropriate defence measures, and this is something that American business owners should learn from. The theft and subsequent leak of cyberweapons developed by the National Security Agency is an issue that the Air Force has acknowledged as being dangerous; since these advanced hacking tools are now in the hands of cybercrime groups, all business and non-profit organizations should keep in mind.

Modern cybersecurity strategies involve more than just firewalls and antivirus software. The Air Force is implementing measures such as constant monitoring, real-time automated responses, alerts, and multi-factor authentication; these same measures can be adopted by small business owners at reasonable costs and scale, the idea is to not fall behind the times with regard to information security.

A Deep Dive into the MythX Smart Contract Security Analysis API

Bernhard Mueller Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 20

This week, we launched five challenges as part of the Ethereal Virtual Hackathon with a prize pool of $6k (paid in crypto, obviously). This quick guide explains how to perform an analysis with MythX API.

What is MythX?

MythX is a security analysis platform for Ethereum smart contracts. It performs a comprehensive range of industry-leading analyses on smart contracts, including input fuzzing, static and symbolic analysis.

The goal of MythX is to make security analysis available to all Ethereum developers — even those who are not security-savvy. In the ongoing Hackathon we award prizes in five categories. For more details on the requirements and prizes check out the Gitcoin issues:

How MythX API works

MythX clients submit Solidity code and solc compiler artifacts to the MythX API (https://api.mythx.io) for analysis. The required imput data can be generated by compiling source code with solc or solc-js. Prerequisite for analysis is that the code is free of syntax errors and compiles successfully. On submitting the request, the analysis service returns an UUID which can then be used to query the analysis status and obtain the results.

The MythX OpenAPI specification describes the API request and response format in detail. However, the easiest way to get familiar with the API is by trying it yourself.

Analysis Walkthrough

In the following walkthrough we’ll use PythX, a Python library that also comes with a simple command line interface (if you’re a JavaScript fan and/or Python hater, you can get similar results by running Sabre with the --debug flag). The first step is to install PythX:

$ pip3 install pythx

You can show the available commands by running pythx --help .

$ pythx --help

Usage: pythx [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

PythX is a CLI/library for the MythX smart contract security analysis API.

Options:

--help Show this message and exit.

Commands:

check Submit a new analysis job based on source code, byte code, or...

login Login to your MythX account

logout Log out of your MythX account

openapi Get the OpenAPI spec in HTML or YAML format

ps Get a greppable overview of submitted analyses

refresh Refresh your MythX API token

report Check the detected issues of a finished analysis job

status Get the status of an analysis by its UUID

top Display the most recent analysis jobs and their status

truffle Submit a Truffle project to MythX

version Print version information of PythX and the API

Note that Pythx’s commands closely mirror the API specification: There’s separate commands for login, refresh, submitting an analysis, and so on. Setting the PYTHX_DEBUG environment variable enables verbose debugging output. We’ll use this to get a closer look at the low-level API requests.

$ export PYTHX_DEBUG=1

Authentication

MythX API uses username/password authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users are identified by their Ethereum address and a password chosen when signing up.

To get started as a MythX developer I recommend signing up for a free account on the MythX website. During the beta, which will run at least until the start of June, free accounts are unrestricted, and we’ll provide special accounts to tool devs once paid subscriptions become available.

To accommodate users who want to try out MythX tools prior to signing up, there is also a built-in trial account with limited capabilities. Specifically, the trial user only receives up to three security issues detected per analysis and cannot list or access historical analyses. The credentials for the trial user are:

Username: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Password: trial

To view the login request, type:

$ pythx login

This will prompt you for an Ethereum address and password. PythX will then send a POST request to the /auth/login endpoint:

POST https://api.mythx.io/v1/auth/login HTTP/1.1

Content-Length: 90

Content-Type: application/json

{"ethAddress": "0x[...]", "password": "[password]"}

If the credentials are valid, the server sends a JSON-formatted response containing the JWT access token and refresh token. By submitting the access token in the Bearer header you can use authenticated endpoints. The access token is valid for 10 minutes, after which you can obtain a new one using the refresh token.

Running an Analysis

While MythX can run an analysis on EVM bytecode only, you have to submit both the source code and bytecode to receive a complete result. The following options exist:

Submit bytecode only. In this case, you need to submit both the creation bytecode and runtime bytecode in the bytecode and deployedBytecode fields, respectively. Note that in this case, you will only receive partial results and the false positive rate will be higher. Submit bytecode and Solidity code. Here, you submit the creation and runtime bytecode as well as the source mappings generated by solc. Additionally, you submit a the list of input filenames in the sourceList field and the source code for each file in the sources field. Note that you must include the filenames and code for all imports (and recursively for imports of imports) as well. Finally, when submitting source code, you must add a mainSource field that tells MythX about the primary file being analyzed. Submit bytecode and ASTs. Same as above, but you submit the abstract syntax tree (AST) of each file instead of the source code. Assuming you are using solc, this is easier to implement than option 2 because solc provides the ASTs for all imports automatically — you can simply pass on the output of solc instead of manually adding the source code for each import. Also, the mainSource field can be ommitted when using ASTs.

As an example, let’s look at the first challenge of the MythX workshop. To perform an analysis from Solidity source with PythX, make sure you that solc is installed an in the path, then run:

$ pythx check -sf Token.sol

What PythX does is running the solc command line tool with the following arguments:

solc --combined-json ast,bin,bin-runtime,srcmap,srcmap-runtime <file>

It then formats the API request according to specification and sends a POST request to the analysis endpoint. The submitted JSON object looks as follows (truncated for brevity):

POST https://api.mythx.io/v1/analyses

Note the two additional configuration parameters:

analysisMode: Currently, there are two analysis modes that differ in the execution time available to the fuzzer and symbolic analyzer. The “quick” mode takes 45–90 seconds to complete, while the “full” mode takes 5–10 minutes. Full mode allows for a deeper analysis that can discover more bugs, such as bugs that require multiple transactions to execute. We are currently working on a third mode (codename “lighting”) that returns a result within a few seconds.

We track usage of different MythX tools for the purpose of revenue sharing: After paid subscriptions go live, 25% of revenues will be split between tool devs proportional to the number of active of active paying users of each tool.

In the response to a newly submitted analysis you will receive a job UUID (allowing you to track analysis progress), as well as some useful meta data. This includes our backend tool versions, a timestamp, the user’s ID, as well as the time the job has been queued and is running. With the status field you are able to track whether your analysis has finished.

}

Note that initially, the analysis status is shown as “queued”. Each analysis request goes through three phases:

Queued: The job has been accepted but not yet picked up by a worker. As long as the API is not overloaded, jobs should remain in “queued” state for only a few seconds.

The job has been accepted but not yet picked up by a worker. As long as the API is not overloaded, jobs should remain in “queued” state for only a few seconds. In progress: The analysis is currently running. In “quick” mode, the analysis should take 45–90 seconds to complete.

PythX, just like other tools in the MythX ecosystem, resolves the given source locations and maps them to line numbers in the Solidity input files. The result from a CLI call getting the report will be displayed as a prettier table:

Client Libraries and Tools

The MythX API is just the first step for us. We aim to build an open-source ecosystem that allows developers of varying skill levels to easily build tools specific to their needs. Security is an integral part of building a sustainable ecosystem. We practice what we preach, so we already came up with a nice little set of tools and libraries that you can get inspiration from. :)

Getting Support

Processing build artifacts and source mappings correctly can become tricky for complex Soldity projects. On way to make things easier is to re-use code of the existing projects listed above. You can also get in contact with the team and other tool devs on the Discord server.

A blind Japanese sailor has completed a non-stop Pacific crossing, reportedly making him the first visually impaired person to do so.

Mitsuhiro Iwamoto, 52, sailed the 8,700-mile (14,000 km) crossing with the help of a sighted navigator.

His 12m (40 ft) yacht made port in Fukushima on Saturday morning, ending his two-month trip.

He left California on 24 February with Doug Smith, an American navigator who assisted him.

His first attempt at the journey in 2013 ended in failure after his boat struck a whale and sank. He had to be rescued by the Japanese military.

Speaking at the port of Iwaki, he told Japan's Kyodo News that completing the challenge on his second attempt was a "dream come true".

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Iwamoto made port in Fukushima on Saturday morning

"I'm the happiest person on earth," he said, according to the news agency.

Mr Iwamoto, who lost his sight aged 16, steered the vessel while Mr Smith gave him verbal guidance, advising him on wind directions and potential hazards.

He is the first blind person to successfully sail across the Pacific without stopping, the Japan Blind Sailing Association says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Iwamoto had to be rescued on his first attempt in 2013

Determined to make the crossing second time around, Mr Iwamoto - a Japanese citizen who currently lives in San Diego - took part in triathlons.

"We undertake this voyage not only for personal accomplishment, but to send a message that anything is possible when people come together," Iwamoto wrote on his website.

He and Mr Smith made the voyage to raise money for charity and for efforts to prevent diseases that cause blindness.
This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one, with ghosts, zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending to be human after they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the humanity. It was inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds on the atmosphere of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s.



Send your sextet of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to investigate murder, affair, and horror in the Town.



Each time, the story will be different. Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces and it is your task to unmask the creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing alien from outer space, a mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated and is now haunting them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously alive and lurking in the streets at night.



Or maybe there is a really bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the University?



It is for you to find out and entertain your readers while bravely standing up against ancient evil.

By Joseph Ax

(Reuters) - Vulnerable House Democrats, mindful of President Donald Trump's continued strength among Republican voters, are using caution in how they respond to the special counsel's report, which detailed Trump's efforts to thwart the investigation into Russian efforts to help him win the White House.

More than 30 Democratic representatives, many of whom are in their first term, represent districts that supported Trump in 2016. The party's chances of keeping control of the U.S. House of Representatives likely hinge its ability to defend those seats.

In the report released on Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Trump may have obstructed justice and portrayed a president bent on stopping the probe into Russian meddling. But Mueller stopped short of concluding that a crime was committed, leaving it to Congress to make its own determination.

That is putting pressure on congressional Democrats to decide whether to pursue impeachment charges against Trump, whose continued popularity with his Republican base could weigh heavily on Democratic lawmakers in swing districts.

Those incumbent Democrats may have to strike a delicate balance on the campaign trail next year. Too much bashing of the president could turn off voters more interested in kitchen-table issues and motivate Trump sympathizers to rally around him.

Hours after Mueller's findings were released, Abby Spanberger, a Democratic congresswoman from Virginia, held a town hall that saw virtually no discussion of the report. She knocked off a Republican incumbent last year in a district that favored Trump by more than 6 percentage points in 2016.

The 39-year-old representative told reporters before the event that she was more interested in preventing Russia from attacking the electoral process than in "re-litigating" the 2016 presidential contest.

"Regardless of what actions the president did or didn't take ... understanding in far greater detail the aggression of a foreign adversary nation against our election's infrastructure should ideally help us avoid such circumstances in the future," she said.

Other Democrats facing reelection in swing districts also reacted cautiously, saying they would reserve judgment until after reading the voluminous report, or emphasizing the threat of Russian interference rather than Trump's behavior.

"If the conclusion remains that there is no further criminal wrongdoing, I think we should, as a country, move on and ensure that Russia cannot interfere again," said Ben McAdams, a freshman Utah Democrat in a Republican-leaning district.

INTERNAL DEBATE

The 448-page report's release has sparked an internal debate within the Democratic Party on how to move forward.

Party leaders played down talk of impeachment, even as they said they would pursue a full, unredacted copy of the report and bring Mueller himself to Capitol Hill to testify under oath. At the same time, some liberal members of the caucus, including Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York, expressed support for starting an impeachment inquiry.

U.S. Representative Cheri Bustos, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the party's House campaign arm, set the tone for her most endangered colleagues on Thursday. In a statement, she said she would read the report carefully, then pivoted to other issues.

"As we review this report, I also remain committed to continuing my efforts to bring down the cost of health care, invest in our infrastructure and clean up the mess in Washington," Bustos said.

Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat who won her first term last fall in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, told Reuters many Democrats were elected because "voters want checks and balances and a return to good government and government we can trust."

Still, speaking after a town hall on Thursday evening, the 35-year-old emphasized that most voters going into 2020 are more concerned about issues such as health care, education and infrastructure.

One of her constituents, Joy Marie Zug, said she voted for Trump in 2016 after having supported Democratic President Barack Obama. Zug says she has since soured on Trump due to his "lies."

The 46-year-old adult education administrator said Democrats should consider impeachment, based on the mountain of evidence in the Mueller report. But in a reflection of the difficulty of the strategic choice facing Democrats, she also said they should avoid making it a top campaign issue.
"We are still in the process of evaluating several options for contemporizing our corporate headquarters, including finding a new corporate campus in the vicinity of our current headquarters" in Pawtucket, the company says.

Massachusetts is “working to establish a dialogue” with Hasbro as the Pawtucket-based children’s toymaker and entertainment company makes a decision on its headquarters.

The state’s Office of Business Development is trying to establish talks “as it regularly does with businesses both in and outside the Commonwealth that may benefit from learning more about the many opportunities to grow in Massachusetts,” spokeswoman Colleen Arons said in an email Friday.

The Massachusetts Office of Business Development is part of the Bay State’s government that helps businesses relocating to Massachusetts or trying to expand there.

"We are still in the process of evaluating several options for contemporizing our corporate headquarters, including finding a new corporate campus in the vicinity of our current headquarters," Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy said in an email. "We are committed to delivering a fully-updated, connected and flexible workspace for all of our employees, and want to find the right solution that will ultimately create the best corporate headquarters for Hasbro into the future."

Rhode Island politicians, meanwhile, have said they’re working to keep the toy company in Rhode Island, and Pawtucket "if we could."

Gov. Gina Raimondo in an interview on April 11 downplayed concerns about the lack of Hasbro headquarters news, saying she keeps in regular touch with Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner.

"There's always a risk," she said. "In this global economy there is always a risk. Shareholder pressure is enormous on these guys."

But, she added: "I check in all the time and I am not worried."

Besides staying in Pawtucket, where it has been for almost a century, possible landing spots in Rhode Island for Hasbro include downtown Providence.

The mayor of Pawtucket, Donald Grebien, sounded alarm bells in November about the possibility that Hasbro would decamp from the city and bring its local jobs elsewhere. The Pawtucket Red Sox announced a move to Worcester last year.

—With reports from Journal staff writer Patrick Anderson
BEIRUT/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met senior officials from his strongest ally Russia in Damascus on Friday and Saturday to discuss upcoming peace talks, renting out Tartus port and trade between the two countries, state media in Syria reported.

Russia has helped Assad’s forces to take back most of the country but the eight-year-long war continues. Swathes of the northeast and northwest are out of his control, while sanctions and a fuel shortage are constricting the economy.

Moscow has pushed for a political process involving talks on a new constitution and elections as a way to end the conflict, but Assad has played down the possibility that the Turkey-backed opposition or foreign countries might participate.

Russia’s Foreign Ministry said late on Friday that Assad had met Moscow’s Syria envoy Alexander Lavrentiev, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin and several Russian Defence Ministry officials.

However, while it said they had discussed the formation of a constitutional committee, which Syria’s opposition last year agreed to join under U.N. auspices after a Russian-hosted peace conference, Syrian state media did not mention it.

Syria’s official SANA news agency said meetings had focused on the next round of talks in Kazakhstan involving Syria, its allies Russia and Iran, and the rebels’ backer Turkey.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria’s war and about half the pre-conflict population of 22 million has been displaced.

Russia launched a military intervention to support Assad in 2015, turning the tide of the fighting in his favor.

On Saturday, SANA said Assad had met Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov to discuss trade and economic cooperation, “particularly in the fields of energy, industry and increasing trade”.

CONTRACT “WITHIN A WEEK”

TASS news agency cited Borisov as saying that a contract on renting Tartus port by Russia was expected to be signed soon.

In 2017, the Russian parliament ratified a deal with Damascus to cement Russia’s foothold in the country and pave the way for establishing a permanent military presence at naval and air bases in Syria.

It was also agreed that Russia would expand and modernize the port’s supply of facilities for its fleet.

Borisov said Russia now hoped to sign the deal to rent the port within a week, according to TASS.

“We have advanced quite substantially on this issue and hope that the contract will be signed within a week and the port Tartus will be transferred for the Russian business usage,” he was quoted as saying. The Tartus naval facility is Russia’s only naval foothold in the Mediterranean.

SANA news agency said Assad and Borisov discussed mechanisms to overcome obstacles including those “resulting from the sanctions which countries against the Syrian people imposed on Syria”.

The United States and European Union imposed tough sanctions on Syria early in the conflict over what they described as atrocities carried out by the government, which it denies.

This week, Syrian state media reported that a fuel shortage which has resulted in rationing and long queues at petrol stations came in the context of difficulty in importing fuel and the halting of a credit line from Iran.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said on Saturday that “Syria is always coordinating with Iran”.

What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?

In 2018, about 4,178 billion kilowatthours (kWh) (or 4.18 trillion kWh) of electricity were generated at utility-scale electricity generation facilities in the United States.1 About 63% of this electricity generation was from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases). About 20% was from nuclear energy, and about 17% was from renewable energy sources. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that an additional 30 billion kWh of electricity generation was from small-scale solar photovoltaic systems in 2018.2

2 Small-scale solar photovoltaic systems are electricity generators with less than one megawatt of electricity generating capacity that are usually at or near the location where the electricity is consumed. Most small-scale solar photovoltaic systems are installed on building rooftops.

3 Pumped storage hydroelectricity generation is negative because most pumped storage electricity generation facilities use more electricity than they produce on an annual basis. Most pumped storage systems use fossil fuels or nuclear energy for pumping water to the storage component of the system.

Yesterday was not a good day for the mainstream media. The Robert Mueller report left journalists associated with outlets like CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times reeling for a hook that would redeem them of their cosmically false reporting on whether President Trump colluded with Russia to manipulate the results of the 2016 election.

New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has been at the forefront of speculative “reporting” dating back to before Trump won the White House. In recent reporting, she took the opportunity to use Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitic comments to call Trump a racist, and of course she had her own personal truth about Russian collusion before the release of the Mueller report concluded there was none. Haberman has certainly been known to bend the news to make the president and his supporters look as evil as possible, even in the absence of evidence.

On Thursday, as press gathered at the White House to eventually hear the news that Mueller had not only swung and missed at proving any Russian collusion, but also came up empty on evidence of obstruction, Haberman had an especially interesting take regarding the White House music selection.

Does…anyone at that White House understand the significance of that song? https://t.co/IK9h8fOwNj — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 18, 2019

“Edelweiss” is original to the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, “The Sound of Music,” and dates back to 1959. More recently, a version of “Edelweiss” was used by the Amazon series, “The Man in the High Castle.”

The series, based on a novel by Phillip K. Dick, takes place in an alternate version of the United States in the 1960s. In the show’s version, the Axis powers won World War II and have split up the United States as German states and Japanese states.

So the version of “Edelweiss” used by the series is meant to sound creepy and uncomfortable. Those unfamiliar with the origins of the song might even think it was supposed to sound like a German folk song now being sung in a zombie-like chorus in the fictionally occupied United States.

Based on Haberman’s tweet, I have to assume she watches “The Man in the High Castle.” While the Amazon series created its own version of the song that guts its emotional sentiment and original purpose, “Edelweiss” was written for “The Sound of Music” as a tear-jerking tribute to Captain von Trapp’s homeland of Austria.

In the musical, based on a true story, the von Trapps are forced to flee their homeland following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. The captain was no fascist, and while he loved Austria and its beautiful, pillowy, alpine flowers greeting him every morning, he knew he must escape to preserve his integrity and protect his family.

In “The Sound of Music,” Captain von Trapp singing “Edelweiss” is one of the most emotional musical numbers of the entire film. He attempts to softly strum a guitar and deliver the lyrics to a small crowd but becomes overwhelmed with emotion when he reaches the line “bless my homeland forever.” His family joins him on stage to help him finish. That night, they flee Nazi persecutors who are trying to recruit the captain into the Nazi war effort.

The namesake flower of the song is also associated with anti-Nazi Austrian Resistance groups, like the “Edelweiss Pirates,” which was comprised mainly of children and teens. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, both Jewish and fiercely anti-Nazi, wrote the song at a later point in the musical production because they felt Captain von Trapp’s patriotism needed to be underscored.

While the White House band likely played “Edelweiss” because it is a beloved showtune penned by legendary American songwriters, the love and patriotism that was written into it make it the perfect song for the White House. Perhaps Haberman believes “Edelweiss” in the modern world is a symbol of a fictional television takeover by Nazis. But the reality, however inconvenient to her narrative, is that because of the sacrifice of so many we still live in the land of freedom without threat of Nazi persecution.

Bless my homeland forever.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s resistance to the privatization of the national postal office has been broken, a senior government source told Reuters on Friday asking for anonymity because the matter remains private.

This change of stance has allowed the economic team to consider ways to sell the state-owned company, the source said, referring to Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos.

The rationale is that a private owner would modernize services and more quickly respond to changes in the marketplace such as responding to growing demand from e-commerce firms.

The national postal service did not immediately respond to a comment request.

Economy Minister Paulo Guedes told Globonews TV this week it would be “a very big leap” for the government to privatize oil major Petroleo Brasileiro SA, which was at the center of an epic corruption scandal in Brazil.

Instead, Guedes said, the president would consider the sale of another key state-owned company. That company, according to the source, is the national postal office.

Ostensibly, Guedes has insisted that the federal government should reduce the size of the state to cut public debt, making companies and the economy more efficient. He has also pointed out that excessive state control over businesses opens up the door to corruption.
In the wake of the Mueller report's release, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) has called for starting impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.

In a Friday afternoon Twitter thread, the senator and 2020 presidential contender laid out her case for impeaching Trump, saying that his efforts to obstruct an investigation into Russian election interference necessitate his removal from office.

"To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country," writes Warren. "The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States."

The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 19, 2019

The odds that Warren will get her wish seem slim. Demanding Trump's head is nonetheless a good publicity stunt for the senator's flagging presidential campaign.

The latest New Hampshire polls show support for Warren at 8.7 percent. That puts her behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and "No Opinion." A Monmouth University Poll from last week put Warren at 7 percent among Iowa Democratic voters.

The senator is likely hoping that demanding Trump be removed from office via impeachment might make her attempt to unseat him in a presidential election a little easier.
Corporate Traveller a prominent travel management firm in the European Union, has started accepting Bitcoin(BTC) for payments.

Partnering with BitPay

The move comes with the latest partnership with BitPay a crypto payments company. BitPay will manage the payments in cryptocurrency for Corporate Traveller.

“We identified an increasing demand from our clients for the option to pay in bitcoin for business travel bookings made by our travel consultants. We chose BitPay to manage our merchant processing because they make it easy and handle the entire process of getting the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash from the customer and depositing cash into our account.” Andy Hegley, U.K. General Manager at Corporate Traveller

Bitcoin-Concerns

According to the reports, Corporate Traveller is not concerned with price volatility in crypto markets, as the Bitcoins will be directly converted into British pounds. For the service rendered BitPay charges 1% commission. Corporate Traveller has commented that the commission is cheaper than credit card processing.

Various Others

Earlier, Expedia, Travala.com had enabled people to make payments in cryptocurrencies. Last year the German National Tourist Board announced that it accepts payments in recognised Cryptocurrency tokens. Various other firms in the industry is also making alterations in their payment mode to include the cryptos.

Also the Government of Queensland in Australia granted TravelbyBit to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. The company as the name suggests enables customers to make their payments for the services rendered in cryptocurrencies.

The travel industry based in the west is witnessing a major change with the arrival of Cryptos into the mainstream. In an opinion the industry can enable Crypto to accelerate into mainstream. And this is that one sector that needs to make overseas payments which is also taken care by Cryptocurrency.
Glenn Greenwald talks to Tucker Carlson followed the release of the Mueller report. Greenwald said the media "went so far off the rails" and just flushed down their whole narrative of the past three years and shifted focus to obstruction. Greenwald lamented that the media is conflating collusion and obstruction to claim "they were right along."



"This is one of the problems that I think let the media just to go so far off the rails is that, especially those two cable networks, but also even newspapers, pretty much prohibited dissent from ever being heard so they constantly fed each other these conspiracy theories and told each other they were on the right track they advanced it further. And never really had to confront anybody who questioned or challenged them in any way," Greenwald said on Thursday's broadcast of 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'





"I've spent the last two years debating everyone I can find who had different views than I had on this whole saga because I wanted to make certain that the things I were saying were scrutinized and subjected to critical rigor," the journalist said. "And that's exactly what they avoided and that's exactly the reason why they went so far off the rails."



"If you listen to the media discourse, outside of a few circles, they've just put collusion and conspiracy and all of those conspiracy theories they've spent the last three years endorsing, just flushed it down the toilet like they don't event exist and just seamlessly shifted to obstruction. And then they're conflating them to claim essentially that they were right all along. And that is really the alarming thing," Greenwald said of the lack of contrition from the media.



"I think that in a lot of ways Donald Trump broke the brains of a lot of people, particularly people in the media who believe that telling lies, inventing conspiracy theories, being journalistically reckless, it's all justified to stop this unparalleled menace," he said. "And that's a good thing for an activist to think and a really bad thing for a journalist to think."
The populist National Rally could win the most European Parliament seats of any French party, with their campaign spearheaded by one of the youngest candidates in the race.

The National Rally (Rassemblement National/RN) has been polling strongly for several months, often neck and neck with the Republic on the Move (La République en Marche!/LREM), the party of French President Emmanuel Macron.

According to some recent polls, the party is expected to be in the running to win the most seats, with 23-year-old Jordan Bardella, the leading RN candidate, being dubbed the “crown prince” of the party, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.

Bardella gave an interview to the Financial Times in January saying, “we are going to fight to go to the European Commission to reclaim our four levers of sovereignty that are to us essential — our borders, economic and legislative sovereignty, and budget control.”

The candidate also commented on the French president’s handling of the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vest) movement saying, “He refuses to listen to the people and insults them whenever he can.”

Having joined the party at the age of 16, Bardella became the leading candidate in the European elections earlier this year.

European Parliament’s Own Prediction Sees Populist Surge in May Elections https://t.co/z2XKOd9kX4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 19, 2019

The election of Bardella would mark one of the youngest members of the European Parliament in its history with only German MEP Ilka Schröder, elected at the age of 21 in 1999, having been younger.

Bardella also follows in the footsteps of former French MP, and niece of Marine Le Pen, Marion Maréchal who, at the time she was first elected, was the youngest MP in French modern political history.

The RN has also confirmed that after next month’s European Parliament election they will be joining populist Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini’s new parliamentary group which was unveiled earlier this month.

Salvini’s conservative-populist “supergroup” has also received support from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the True Finns, the Austrian Freedom Party, and the Danish People’s Party.

Michael Gove has told environmental protesters “we’ve got the message” as campaigners vow the disruption in London will continue for weeks.

The Environment Secretary’s comments came after some activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn’s garden fence.

A total of 340 people had been arrested by Wednesday evening during ongoing protests in Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch this week.

Scotland Yard could not confirm whether or not anyone had been charged with any criminal offences.

Campaigners said the cells in the capital were full and “operating on a one-in, one-out capacity”, while some of those being released from custody have rejoined the protests.

The Metropolitan Police said: “Our custody suites are not full and we are continuing to arrest those who are breaking the law.”

The force added that those continuing to demonstrate in areas where a restriction is in place face prosecution.

Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge are all subject to a condition that protesters should only demonstrate at Marble Arch.

Asked about the Extinction Rebellion protests on the BBC’s The One Show, Mr Gove said: “I do worry sometimes about some of the scenes we’ve seen and some of the activity that goes on.

“So I think it’s appropriate for people to make their feelings known but I also think, we’ve got the message, we understand that action needs to be taken.

“And in fact some of the activity that’s been going on on the streets has actually stopped people doing their jobs and also impeded, for example, people getting around London in a way that’s appropriate.”

Two men and two women from the Extinction Rebellion (XR) group used a bike lock to attach themselves to a fence and glued their hands together outside Jeremy Corbyn’s house in north London on Wednesday.

They said they all support Mr Corbyn but want the Labour Party to go further than declaring a “climate emergency”.

As they left, one protester, Tracee Williams, 55, said: “We just really felt we had to bring it to his front door.”

British Transport Police (BTP) arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of obstructing the railway after activists clambered aboard the carriage of a train at Canary Wharf station on Wednesday morning.

A smartly dressed man and woman glued their hands to the roof before being removed and taken away in a police van.

Activists said they plan to continue their roadblocks, which have affected more than half a million people with road closures, traffic gridlock and disruption to transport and businesses since Monday, until at least next Friday.

Spokeswoman Jayne Forbes told the Press Association: “We would obviously look to go on for two weeks and if we can go on longer then even better.

“It depends on the rebels.

“We have got quite a lot of people committed to do it for the whole two weeks.”

Robin Boardman-Pattison, 21, who earlier walked off during an interview with Sky News, said activists were planning to step up action on the rail and London Underground network.

“We will be escalating our disruption throughout the week,” he said.

“The impact to the Tube system will grow.”

XR, who are demanding a meeting with the Government, says direct action is needed to force authorities to act urgently on climate change and wildlife declines and halt a “sixth mass extinction”.

A protester being picked up by police (@ExtinctionR/PA)

TV presenter and naturalist Chris Packham joined protesters at Oxford Circus, saying: “I believe the world’s leaders are not acting urgently enough to avert a climate catastrophe.

“As long as it is peaceful and democratic then they can count on my support.”

A YouGov poll of 3,561 UK adults suggested public opinion has swung against the protests, while some Londoners hit out at the group’s “seriously flawed” methods.

The survey results show 52% either “somewhat oppose” or “strongly oppose” the action, compared with 36% who “strongly support” or “somewhat support” it.

Music student Anouska Stahlmann, 20, said her ill mother and elderly grandparents had to walk part of their journey because of the risk of getting stuck in a tunnel while on the Tube.

“I have no issue with wanting to better the environment and we’re fairly conscious of it as a family,” she said.

“Their methods, however, are seriously flawed and are not inclusive of people who want to support the cause.

“I find it awful they’re disintegrating into a rent-a-mob mentality really.

“I’d expect better.”
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hundreds of people were evacuated from the area near the communications ministry

Seven people were killed in an attack on the Afghan ministry of information in Kabul, officials said.

An explosion was heard at 11:40 local time (07:10 GMT) and sporadic gunfire continued for over six hours before officials declared the incident over.

A ministry source said one of the attackers got inside the building.

The attack comes a day after talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban were suspended, but the Taliban said they were not behind the assault.

Among the dead were four civilians and three police officers, while another eight civilians were wounded.

Although Kabul still sees fighting, this attack follows months of relative calm.

What's happening on the ground?

The attack happened in a busy area of central Kabul, near one of the city's most popular hotels, a couple of other ministries, and the presidential palace.

There were four attackers in total - all of whom were eventually shot dead by police officers.

The Serena Hotel, which is heavily fortified, is one of the few still used by foreign visitors.

At 18 storeys high, the information ministry building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul.

About 2,000 people were feared to have been stranded inside for hours, until they were eventually freed.

Footage broadcast on local TV showed a small cloud of smoke rising near the tower block, while people climbed out of the windows of one of the lower levels, AFP news agency reported.

Hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the building, the ministry said, but eight people were injured and taken to hospital.

Who is responsible?

The Taliban's spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the organisation was not behind Saturday's attack.

The Afghan branch of the Islamic State group has carried out a number of deadly attacks in Kabul but has not so far said it was behind this one.

Where are we with peace talks?

The US and the Taliban have been involved in attempts to negotiate a peace process. The sides have held five rounds of direct talks since October 2018, and are now in the middle of their sixth.

A conference between officials from the militant group and about 250 Afghan politicians had been due to take place in the Qatari capital Doha on 20 and 21 April.

But the meeting was abruptly called off on Thursday after the Taliban complained about the size and status of the Afghan delegation.

In a statement, the Taliban accused the Afghan government of "sabotaging this conference and peace efforts".

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The building is believed to be one of the tallest in Kabul

The goal is to resolve Afghanistan's civil conflict and negotiate the withdrawal of US forces in the country.

The US also wants the Taliban to guarantee that Afghan territory won't be used by foreign militants, and that they won't pose a security threat to the rest of the world.

In 2001 a US-led military coalition overthrew the Taliban for sheltering al-Qaeda, the militant group behind the 9/11 attacks.

US officials say the conflict in Afghanistan now costs them about $45bn (£34bn) a year.

The Taliban currently control and influence more territory than they have at any point in the past 18 years.

Topics covered are as follows :
Formerly known as Russia Today, the channel gives airtime to pundits from left and right – many of them UK politicians. After a week watching its often surreal output, our writer asks himself: is this really the best Moscow can do?

The top story on the 9am news on RT – the Kremlin-backed English-language television channel formerly known as Russia Today – is about the EU’s renewed approval for a weedkiller produced by Monsanto. It includes rather elaborate coverage of a small-looking protest outside the European parliament, and excerpts from a debate on the safety or otherwise of glyphosates. On the strength of this opening five minutes, I might once have been tempted to conclude that it was a slow news day, but on RT every day is a slow news day.

According to its detractors, RT is Vladimir Putin’s global disinformation service, countering one version of the truth with another in a bid to undermine the whole notion of empirical truth. And yet influential people from all walks of public life appear on it, or take its money. You can’t criticise RT’s standards, they say, if you don’t watch it. So I watched it. For a week.

Following the Monsanto report, there is a roundup of anti-terrorist measures being implemented across Europe for the Christmas period – concrete barriers positioned outside Christmas markets, wrapped up like giant presents, that sort of thing – followed by a warning from newsreader Rory Suchet that 100% safety is “impossible to ensure”.

Suchet, the son of former ITV newsreader John Suchet and the nephew of actor David Suchet, has been working for RT since 2009. The offspring of well-known people feature often on RT. Sophie Shevardnadze, who presents Sophie & Co, is the granddaughter of former Georgian president and Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Tyrel Ventura, who presents Watching the Hawks on RT America, is the son of wrestler-turned-politician Jesse Ventura. His co-host is Oliver Stone’s son Sean.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sean Stone is interviewd by Tyrel Ventura and Tabetha Wallace on RT

Russia Today was launched in 2005. Svetlana Mironyuk, the director of state-run RIA-Novosti, the news agency that oversees the channel, said at the time that western perceptions of Russia came down to three words: communism, snow and poverty. “We would like to present a more complete picture of life in our country,” she said.

But Russia barely figures in RT’s coverage; its main stories tend to concern the Middle East, or European infighting or social injustice in the US. Its overarching narrative is a tale of the west’s unrelenting decline. Its regular financial programme is called Boom Bust. On the Keiser Report, former US stockbroker Max Keiser says that “Donald Trump is helping to ease America into being a second-tier country, and I think that’s the most responsible thing he could do”. He suggests that Americans will have to learn to live on $3,000 or $4,000 a year, “or give in to your Chinese overlords”. His guest agrees with him. On RT, everybody agrees with everybody.

When Russia does make the news on RT, the Kremlin has little to worry about. Earlier this week, the main story was about a possible blanket ban on Russian Olympic athletes implicated in the doping scandal. Over the course of the day, reports repeatedly cited a “persistent lack of evidence” for a state-sponsored doping regime and sought to characterise the whole scandal as a western propaganda exercise aimed at undermining the next Russian presidential election. Foreign governments deploying disinformation to influence elections – where do they get this stuff?

That day’s BBC Radio 4 lunchtime news did carry a brief report about the upcoming Winter Olympics, but it was about security concerns in South Korea; it didn’t mention the doping scandal at all. That is probably because the doping scandal wasn’t really news that day. Four Russian athletes had been banned for life the previous week; an announcement on further bans was still a week away. The McLaren report, which offered firm evidence that Russia operated a state-sponsored doping regime, came out last year.

RT’s stated mission is to offer an “alternative perspective on major global events”, but the world according to RT is often downright surreal. Fringe opinion takes centre stage. Reporting is routinely bolstered by testimony from experts you have never heard of, representing institutions you have never heard of. A later update of that Christmas terrorist story gave ample airtime to “political commentator” Graham Moore, who turns out to belong to something called the “White Pendragons” and whose most recent YouTube posting on “civic nationalism” has garnered just 177 views at the time of writing, including mine.

On Crosstalk, RT’s flagship discussion programme hosted by an American in a bow-tie called Peter Lavelle, one regular participant, Victor Olevich, is described as “a leading expert at the Centre for Actual Politics”. A Google search for “the centre for actual politics” produces precisely one hit – from a previous Crosstalk transcript.

That is not to say the channel is peopled entirely by nonentities: lots of present and former UK politicians from the left and the right turn up on RT regularly. Nigel Farage has been on; so has Ann Widdicombe. George Galloway co-hosts a chatshow with his wife. The Commons register of interests shows that, in the past two years, MPs including David Davies, Rosie Duffield, Mike Freer and Nigel Evans have been paid up to £1,000 an hour to appear on RT programmes. Former Scottish leader Alex Salmond recently launched his own programme. And it’s not just politicians: Larry King and Stan Collymore both make programmes for RT. Germaine Greer and Peter Tatchell have appeared on it, along with a number a journalists who write for, among other publications, the Guardian.

Some MPs, notably David Gauke, have refused to speak to RT. David Lammy has resolved not to appear on the channel in future. But David Davies (the Monmouth backbencher, not Brexit minister David Davis) has defended his appearances on the satirical show Sam Delaney’s News Thing. “The News Thing has given me a fair chance to explain my opinions on Brexit, immigration and transgender issues, for which I am grateful,” he told the Observer this month. “Sadly, I have not received the same courtesy from the British Broadcasting Corporation.”

To be fair, much of what one sees on RT is pretty harmless, or at least inconsequential. Over the course of a week, I watched one debate on gender issues that seemed fairly sensible, even mildly enlightening. “The annoying thing about RT is that some of the reporting is very good and genuine,” says Misha Glenny, the author of McMafia. “The trick is trying to differentiate that from the propaganda. The Russians have moved on since the days of Pravda, the Soviet Communist party newspaper, or Radio Moscow International during the cold war – at least then you knew it was all guff, coming out of the Ideological Secretariat. RT is designed to confuse and muddy the waters. That mixture of genuine and guff leaves you baffled and disoriented, which, I guess, is the point.”

In 2010, RT America was launched, followed by RT UK in 2014. Certain programmes are made under these auspices in Washington and London – and some RT America shows turn up on RT UK – but much of the time you are getting RT International programming from Moscow. Many of the British and American reporters on its roster have been with the channel since 2005; some were recruited straight from journalism school. According to a 2010 article in the Columbia Journalism Review, even from the beginning these inexperienced recruits were paid six-figure salaries for five days’ work a fortnight.

While the exact nature of the relationship between RT and the Russian state is never made apparent, critics say it cannot be overplayed: for them, RT is the Russian state. The channel’s defenders – almost exclusively people who work for it and appear on it – say they are free from the Kremlin’s influence and unafraid to speak truth to power. But in the US, RT America has been obliged to register as a foreign agent. RT UK has been reprimanded by Ofcom a dozen times for lack of balance.

Peter Pomerantsev, author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible, about Putin’s Russia, and now a senior visiting fellow in global affairs at the London School of Economics, was in Moscow working in television when Russia Today first started hiring graduates from Britain and the US. “The people were really bright, they were being paid well,” he says. But they soon found they were being ordered to change their copy, or instructed how to cover certain stories to reflect well on the Kremlin. “Everyone had their own moment when they first twigged that this wasn’t like the BBC,” he says. “That, actually, this is being dictated from above.” The coverage of Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008 was a lightbulb moment for many, he says. They quit.

There are clearly varying levels of independence at RT. Larry King’s shows are produced by his own company, Ora TV. Galloway’s programme is preceded by a warning that “the views and opinions expressed in the following programme do not necessarily coincide with those of RT”. But some of the channel’s reporters have complained of interference and bias. In 2014, RT America newsreader Liz Wahl resigned on air over the channel’s coverage of the Crimea crisis. Later that year, correspondent Sara Firth also quit after tweeting: “We do work for Putin. We are asked on a daily basis, if not to totally ignore, then to obscure the truth.”

One open question is: who is watching RT, besides me? The service claims to have access to a worldwide audience of 700 million people – you can get it online, on Sky, Freeview or in almost any hotel – but RT has never released actual UK viewing figures. The most recent figures available from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board gave RT a weekly reach of 413,000 viewers for the week 13-19 November (compared with 4.4 million for Sky News, and 7.3 million for BBC News). That is an audience share of 0.02%. But RT is big on Twitter and YouTube. “Its social media is much more important than the channel, because no one really watches that,” says Pomerantsev.

If you went by its adverts, you might initially think it was viewed exclusively by people who are desperate to buy gold bullion, over-50s travel insurance or funeral protection policies. But if you watch long enough, you will also see ads for Samsung, Maltesers, Whiskas and Extra gum. Evidently these brands think there is someone out there to sell to.

The basic cycle of RT’s schedules is simple: the news comes every hour at the top of the hour, followed by some sort of analysis or documentary at half past. Even for a rolling news channel, it is insanely repetitive. The news reports often barely differ from one hour to the next, and its regular programmes – Going Underground, Crosstalk, On Contact, The Keiser Report – are broadcast with numbing frequency, and updated infrequently. In one 24-hour period, I caught the same documentary – about a mysterious sleeping sickness affecting residents of a former mining town in Kazakhstan – three times. It was made in 2015.

RT is never more surreal than when the topic is RT itself. On a recent edition of Crosstalk, the panellists discussed RT America’s new status as a registered foreign agent. “Civil liberties groups, the mainstream media, they’re all silent on this,” said one. “Where is the ACLU [the American Civil Liberties Union]? This is a blatant infringement of free speech!” Everyone else, as usual, concurs. Even I agree that the ACLU’s lack of interest in the case is telling, but perhaps not in the way they think.

In response to accusations a few weeks ago that the channel is a mere propaganda mouthpiece for Putin, Sam Delaney mounted an odd stunt on his satirical show. He produced what he called “Putin’s Lie Machine” – a vintage computer prop with blinking lights that churned out “fake news” headlines, challenging MP Michael Fabricant to guess whether they were true or not. It wasn’t remotely satirical, or even slightly funny (as you might imagine, Fabricant was no help), but it did treat the accusations against RT as if they were too preposterous to address head-on. And they are not preposterous.

More than outright lies, RT deals in moral equivalency. Its defenders don’t deny bias; they deny the possibility of objectivity. They say western media is equally biased. They liken RT to state broadcasters such as the BBC, France 24 and al Jazeera. They say other news channels have been sanctioned by Ofcom. It’s a triumph of cynicism: we’re all just as bad as each other.
The Massachusetts senator is the most senior Democrat to call for the start of impeachment proceedings against Trump

Elizabeth Warren on Friday became the most senior Democrat, and the first 2020 presidential candidate, to call for the start of impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump following the release of the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 US election and the Trump campaign.

The key unanswered questions from the Mueller report Read more

“To ignore a president’s repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways,” the Democratic senator from Massachusetts said in a statement Friday, one day after the release of a redacted version of a 448-page summary of Robert Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation.

“The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States,” Warren said.

Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.” The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.

Mueller did not make a conclusion about whether the president unlawfully obstructed justice, but did outline nearly a dozen cases in which the president had attempted to stop the inquiry or narrow its scope.

Warren’s remarks make her one of the most prominent Democratic voices to advocate for impeachment, joining congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib. Those progressive House members have pushed a formal impeachment resolution.

Backers of impeachment have argued that the Democrats have a legal and ethical responsibility to launch the proceedings and continue the investigation into Trump and the question of obstruction of justice.

Other Democrats fear that it would be politically unwise to begin the impeachment process close to the 2020 presidential election, raising concerns that a protracted political battle could alienate some voters and arguing that voters ultimately care more about issues like heathcare and the economy. Some have said they are also wary of vice-president Mike Pence replacing the president, given Pence’s conservative political record.

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has repeatedly said she is not in favor of impeachment. In March, Pelosi said the process would be “so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path”. She did not shift her stance after the release of the Mueller report this week.

Mueller's report would have signaled the end for anyone other than Trump Read more

Some Democrats have instead focused on their calls to have Mueller testify before Congress and for the justice department to release an unredacted version of the report.

So far, Warren is the only Democrat running for president in 2020 to formally call for impeachment hearings. Though Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, indicated earlier on Friday that he would support Congress opening impeachment proceedings. “It would be perfectly reasonable for Congress to open up impeachment hearings”, Castro told CNN.

Both senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker argued it was too soon to talk about impeachment. “I think that there is definitely a conversation to be had on that subject, but first I want to hear from Bob Mueller.” Harris said.

Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend mayor, said there was “evidence that this president deserves to be impeached”, but that it was up to Congress to make that decision.

The former representative Beto O’Rourke argued he believed voters cared more about policy discussions, telling reporters, “I don’t know that impeachment and those proceedings in the House and potential trial in the Senate is going to answer those questions for people.”
With gas pushing $1.70 per litre, they're keeping a keen eye on how higher fuel costs will impact their fuel budgets.

British Columbians already feeling the pinch at the pump might see a few extra pennies on their tax bills too, due to the record-smashing gas prices across Metro Vancouver.

With gas pushing $1.70 per litre, governments and publicly funded agencies are keeping a keen eye on how higher fuel costs will impact the fuel budgets for their fleets, with some counting the days until more electric vehicles provide relief.

City fleets typically include cars and trucks used by engineering, sanitation and parks departments, specialty vehicles like Zambonis, utility vehicles, forklifts, and fire trucks and police cars.

The City of Surrey anticipates taxpayers could be on the hook for up to an additional $150,000-$180,000 to fuel its fleet in 2019, compared with 2018.

“The current budget does build in increases for fluctuating fuel costs,” a spokesman said in an email. “However, the recent sharp spike in gas prices will have an impact if they continue for an extended period of time.”

A Metro spokeswoman said that if gas prices stay at $1.68 per litre, taxpayers will contribute about $200,000 more to fuel its fleet in 2019. At the same time, Metro says it’s adding more electric vehicles to compensate for higher gas prices in the future.

But recent increases at private fuel stations don’t impact the City of Vancouver’s fleet because of contracts the city already has for fuel purchases, a spokeswoman said. The city’s ongoing transition to electric vehicles — it boasts one of the largest municipal electric fleets in Canada — has helped too.

“To lessen the impact of fuel-price increases through these contracts the city has pursued different technology options and replaced 115 fleet vehicles with electric models and transitioned to compressed natural gas to power refuse-collection vehicles,” the spokeswoman said.

A TransLink spokeswoman said the agency forecasts the average price of gasoline and diesel for each annual budget and so far this year it has spent less than anticipated due to lower-than-expected prices at the start of 2019.

Some of TransLink’s buses in Vancouver are trolleys that run on electricity, but a portion of its bus fleet and its non-revenue vehicles, such as maintenance vehicles and pool cars, use gas and diesel.
A trio of Belgium-based boffins have created a ward that renders wearers unrecognizable to software trained to detect people.

In a research paper distributed through ArXiv in advance of its presentation at computer vision workshop CV-COPS 2019, Simen Thys, Wiebe Van Ranst and Toon Goedeme from KU Leuven describe how some colorful abstract signage can defend against Darknet, an open source neural network framework that supports You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection.

The paper is titled "Fooling automated surveillance cameras: adversarial patches to attack person detection."

Adversarial images that dupe machine learning systems have been the subject of considerable research in recent years. While there have been many examples of specially crafted objects that trip up computer vision systems, like stickers that can render stop signs unrecognizable, the KU Leuven boffins contend no previous work has explored adversarial images that mask a class of things as diverse as people.

"The idea behind this work is to be able to circumvent security systems that use a person detector to generate an alarm when a person enters the view of a camera," explained Wiebe Van Ranst, a PhD researcher at KU Leuven, in an email to The Register. "Our idea is to generate an occlusion pattern that can be worn by a possible intruder to conceal the intruder from for the detector."

What makes the work challenging, he said, is how varied people are in the way they appear, with different clothing, poses, and so on.

The researchers targeted the popular YOLOv2 convolutional neural network by feeding it their dataset of images to return bounding boxes that outline people identified by the detection algorithm.

"On a fixed position relative to these bounding boxes, we then apply the current version of our patch to the image under different transformations," they explain in their paper.

"The resulting image is then fed (in a batch together with other images) into the detector. We measure the score of the persons that are still detected, which we use to calculate a loss function. Using back propagation over the entire network, the optimiser then changes the pixels in the patch further in order to fool the detector even more."

Van Ranst said having access to footage from a surveillance camera can be used to train a more reliable patch. "However, this is not strictly necessary, we can also use an existing database of images as training data (as we do in the paper)," he said.

"In later experiments we did however notice that our current technique can be quite sensitive to the dataset our detector was trained on. Making it more robust to these cases is something we would like to investigate in the future."

The result of this process, a colorful patch that's 40cm (~15 inch) square, is just a bit larger than the cardboard sleeve of a vinyl record or a glossy magazine. It has been formulated to throw off the YOLOv2 software's ability to identify people.

The researcher's work can be seen in this YouTube video.

"In most cases our patch is able to successfully hide the person from the detector," the researchers explain in their paper. "Where this is not the case, the patch is not aligned to the center of the person."

Looking ahead, the researchers hope to generalize their work to other neural network architectures like Faster R-CNN. They believe that they will be able turn their pattern into a T-shirt print that will make people "virtually invisible" to object-detection algorithms in automatic surveillance cameras.

Presently, however, the pattern needs to be directly visible to the camera being fooled. According to Van Ranst, further work needs to be done to make the pattern functional when viewed at an angle. ®

Whenever her son detects a strange force rippling in the fabric of spacetime, such as a gravitational wave or binary black hole, Sharon Yellowfly begins the delicate work of translating the vocabulary of his work—astrophysics—into Blackfoot, an indigenous language. Blackfoot traditionally has no words for these kinds of observations. Sometimes her act of translation is as simple as mashing two words together. Other times, it rises to the level of poetry. After hearing an astronomer describe the sound black holes make as a “chirp,” Yellowfly translated the term into biixiini_gi, or “bird singing.”

For the past 21 years, as a lead operator at the California Institute of Technology’s Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Yellowfly’s son, Corey Gray, has helped to run machines that detect gravitational waves. These violent ripples travel through spacetime like waves created by a pebble dropped into a pond. They can be caused by the collision of two black holes or the collapse of supernova, and there are even some still rippling around from the birth of the universe—you know, small things.

Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves over a century ago in his general theory of relativity, but scientists only first observed these ripples in 2015, thanks to LIGO detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, where Gray works. (It seems like we’re always going to be catching up to Einstein). When Gray, who is a member of the Siksika Nation of Alberta, Canada, found out about this major scientific milestone, he began to think about the press releases. They would no doubt be translated into widely spoken languages—French, Japanese, Mandarin. “That’s when I thought it would be freaking cool to get my mom involved and translate this news into Blackfoot,” Gray says, adding that he isn’t quite fluent in the language himself. “This way she would be a poet for Einstein and astrophysics. A code-talker for gravitational waves.”

After asking for permission to break the embargo on talking about the discovery—so he could tell his mom—Gray pitched her the idea. With some understandable trepidation, she said yes. Yellowfly had just two weeks to translate astrophysical jargon into words that had never before existed. “When Corey emailed me the press release, I opened it, and was like ‘Oh my goodness,’” she says. “‘What is the word for that! What does this mean?” She called relatives for help and asked Gray to explain meatier topics. Right before the announcement deadline, Yellowfly completed a full translation of the press release into Blackfoot , one of the 17 languages it appeared in. The mother-son duo also released a video of Yellowfly reading the release out loud. Since 2015, she has translated five additional press releases on LIGO discoveries.

Though she now lives in southern California, Yellowfly grew up on a reserve in southern Alberta, Canada. In 1957, she enrolled in the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, as was required by Canadian law. These boarding schools were a long and cruel tradition in Canada, where governments and churches pursued a policy of cultural genocide to stamp out the culture of First Nations people, according to a 2015 report from the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Yellowfly remembers that the first French word her mother learned during her own boarding school experience was “sauvage,” the slur the nuns lobbed at their indigenous pupils.

“The school wanted to get rid of everything that made us native,” Yellowfly says. “The language, the religion, the ideology—everything that was Blackfoot.” If the nuns caught children speaking their native language, the children weren’t allowed to return home over the weekend, and could be physically punished. Yellowfly remembers how she and her classmates developed an underground whisper network in which they spoke to each other in Blackfoot whenever the nuns were out of sight. These small acts of rebellion helped Yellowfly cling to her identity and language.

Blackfoot is an agglutinative language, meaning its words are sculpted out of morphemes (linguistics’ smallest building blocks) that can stand on their own, even if removed from the word, according to Eldon Yellowhorn, a professor of First Nations studies at Simon Fraser University. Instead of sentences, Blackfoot relies on long phrases all built around a root word swathed in prefixes and suffixes. For example, the word for “goodbye” in kitakitamatsinopoao, which is comprised of the morphemes that individually translate to “you and I will see each other again.”

Yellowfly deconstructed the press release’s intimidating jargon into four categories. First, she identified traditional words that already exist in Blackfoot, such as naduusi (Sun), gagaduusi (star), and spuu?ts (universe). Second, she noted words that could be directly translated by combining traditional words. For example, “black holes” becomes sigooxgiya—a merger of the Blackfoot words for “black” and “holes.” Similarly, “binary black holes” becomes nadugisstsii sigooxgiya. This approach is similar to how Blackfoot linguists have coined other new words, Yellowhorn says, such as miiksskimmapi, the word for “robot,” which translates to “iron man.”

(In order to indicate sounds and inflections unique to Blackfoot, Yellowfly peppers her translation with symbols and capitalization defined by a key in the press release. For example, “?” indicates a glottal stop, or a consonant produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract. In English, we pronounce the word “button” with a glottal stop, skipping over the “o.” Yellowfly also capitalizes “A” to indicate when the vowel should be pronounced like it sounds in “acorn.”)

The other two categories required more careful consideration. Yellowfly grouped together conceptual words that require a deeper understanding of physics for proper translation. Take the interferometer, an instrument that splits a beam of light in two to create a measurable interference pattern, and is how observatories such as LIGO detect gravitational waves. There is nothing in Blackfoot remotely close to this, so Yellowfly created a new word inspired by what the instrument actually does. She landed on Anatsiwayagidutsim gii idumuya issxgwibiists, which translates to “light-splitter and marry/union measurements.”

In a way, Yellowfly’s conceptual translation makes it easier for someone unfamiliar with an interferometer to grasp what it does. She translated “gamma rays”—radiation emitted from the decay of atomic nuclei—into igaguu esstuumsKuutsp aanatsiists AsAxgaasimya, or “many provisions of self-strengthened lights exploding.” “Gravitational waves,” on the other hand, became Abuduuxbiisii o?bigimskAAsts, or “they stick together waves.”

The final and most challenging category in Yellowfly’s system concerns words or phrases that require an additional layer of certain poetic license. “There were words that would take four or five pages to explain,” she says. The most prominent challenge, of course, was how to translate “Einstein’s theory of relativity.” Yellowfly knew she only had to translate the phrase, not the theory itself. She chose bisaatsinsiimaan, or “beautiful plantings.” Bisaatsinsiimaan does not translate in any direct way to the theory itself, but rather acts as a metaphor for Einstein’s legacy. “This was a brilliant man who had this theory that hadn’t been proven,” Yellowfly explains. “The plantings of his ideas would be harvested by people later on, on so many different levels.”

Precontact Blackfoot territory ranged over a wide swath of Western prairie in what is now Canada and the United States, according to a report from the Blackfoot Language Resources and Digital Dictionary. But according to a 2011 census, just 3,250 people speak Blackfoot as their mother tongue. Over the past century, Blackfoot-speaking tribes began to recognize the need to preserve their language before it disappeared entirely. In 1989, Donald Frantz, a linguist at the University of Lethbridge, and Norma Jean Russell, a native expert on the Blackfoot language, compiled the first Blackfoot dictionary of stems, roots, and affixes. It’s now gone through several updates, most recently in 2017.

Yellowfly did not consult the dictionary’s official writing system for her project, and decided instead to work phonetically to preserve the local inflections of what she calls her own “accent” of Blackfoot. “You kind of lose the beauty and flow of the language when you’re not speaking it or hearing it, and the inflections mean a lot,” she says. Like most languages, Blackfoot branches out into a web of local dialects with distinct phonetics, lexicon, grammar, and slang—almost none of which lands in the official dictionary. In her eyes, Yellowfly’s own translation incorporates the distinct way she learned to speak Blackfoot.

This customization does make it more difficult to read. Frantz had to conduct some guesswork to understand Yellowfly’s translation, he writes in an email. The official dictionary, as its name suggests, is perfect for linguists but somewhat inaccessible to actual members of the Blackfoot community, according to the Blackfoot Language Resources and Digital Dictionary project. Yellowfly’s translation includes a key to help people understand how she defines her own phonetics.

At the age of 23, while speaking with her mother in the kitchen, Yellowfly came up with the idea to create her own Blackfoot dictionary. Her mother referenced a piece of toast, a word that does not exist in Blackfoot, by coining a new term that roughly translates to “bread that is burnt.” Yellowfly began compiling words as her parents spoke them to her, a project she tabled after they passed. But her recent translation work for LIGO inspired her to pick up the project again.

Yellowfly sees her dictionary less as an academic project and more as a way to impart the language to her two sons and two daughters, who all speak varying degrees of Blackfoot. “There were so many things I wished I had asked my parents, but they’re gone now and all that knowledge and experience and words are gone with them,” she says. “I know that when I’m gone, my kids will have some questions. This will be a little bit of me that will be with them.” Ever the organizer, Yellowfly divides her dictionary into three sections: a traditional dictionary, one that includes commonly used words for real-life situations, and a third that contains personal dialogues between people in her life.

Since the first astrophysics translation, Gray and Yellowfly have worked together to spread awareness of gravitational wave astronomy to Blackfoot speakers, and introduce members of the scientific community to them. Gray helped organize a traditional Blackfoot grass dance competition at the tribe’s annual pow wow before rushing home to monitor the first “triple” detection of a binary neutron star. A few years back, the two co-presented their results at an indigenous language symposium at the University of Lethbridge, which is located in Blackfoot territory. Relatives from their tribe came out to hear them speak. Last summer, Yellowfly visited Gray for a tour of LIGO’s observatory, where she got to see the 2.5-mile-long arm of the interferometer that first detected a gravitational wave.

Though Gray has always considered himself a mama’s boy, this project has brought the two even closer together. They text often, about Gray’s work and random vocabulary questions that pop up as he tries to improve his grasp of the language. “As I’m getting older, I don’t have to be as much of a disciplinarian,” Yellowfly says. “So Corey now feels like a child who is also my friend.”

“My mom is a superstar,” Gray says, meaning every sense of the word.

Una sera di maggio del 2016 un giovane consigliere di Donald Trump, all’epoca candidato alla presidenza degli Stati Uniti, si sedette a tavolo con un diplomatico australiano in una lussuosa enoteca di Kensington, uno dei più eleganti quartieri di Londra. Dopo diverse bottiglie di vino, in un’atmosfera di alticcio cameratismo, il consigliere di Trump, George Papadopoulos, disse di aver saputo che il governo russo era entrato in possesso di migliaia di mail in qualche modo compromettenti per Hillary Clinton, la candidata del Partito Democratico statunitense data in quel momento per grande favorita in vista delle elezioni presidenziali.

Due mesi dopo quella sera, il sito Wikileaks iniziò a pubblicare migliaia di mail rubate dalle caselle di posta dei dirigenti del Partito Democratico e del comitato Clinton. Il diplomatico australiano capì che quelle che aveva sentito non erano soltanto chiacchiere da ubriachi, e avvertì l’FBI. La sua denuncia fu uno degli elementi più importanti tra quelli che portarono l’agenzia a iniziare le indagini su una possibile collaborazione tra il governo russo e il comitato elettorale di Donald Trump. L’indagine è durata oltre due anni: si è conclusa soltanto questa settimana con la pubblicazione del “rapporto Mueller”, che descrive e dettaglia i tantissimi contatti tra le persone del comitato Trump e i russi, molti dei quali erano stati smentiti in questi mesi, e mostra come fossero tutti ben felici e consapevoli di quello che stava succedendo ma non “complici”, secondo gli inquirenti. Quell’incontro al bar di Kensington, ha scritto il New York Times, è diventato così «l’improbabile fiammifero che ha consumato i primi anni dell’amministrazione Trump».

Ma come faceva un giovane consigliere di Trump, praticamente privo di esperienza, a sapere del furto di mail subito dal Partito Democratico due mesi prima che la notizia divenisse di dominio pubblico? La risposta a questa domanda è una storia oscura e a volte grottesca, che comincia in Italia e che è stata definita da chi l’ha seguita nel nostro paese «a metà tra un romanzo di Le Carrè e una commedia dei fratelli Vanzina». Passa per misteriosi professori scomparsi, finte “nipoti di Putin”, spie e truffatori che si incontrano in un bizzarro crocevia: una sfuggente università privata italiana, frequentata da diplomatici e persone che lavorano nel settore dell’intelligence, e che ha fornito al Movimento 5 Stelle una buona parte dei suoi ministri e sottosegretari.

La storia, su cui hanno indagato moltissimi giornalisti italiani e stranieri, e che è stata in buona parte confermata dal rapporto Mueller, comincia in realtà qualche mese prima, nel marzo del 2016, quando il giovane George Papadopoulos, un consulente di 28 anni che si occupava di energia, venne assunto dal comitato elettorale di Donald Trump che in quei giorni era alla disperata ricerca di esperti con cui mettere insieme un team di politica estera. Per una curiosa coincidenza, Papadopoulos quasi contemporaneamente fu assunto da un’organizzazione piuttosto ambigua, il London Centre of International Law and Practice Limited (LCILP), che secondo il suo sito è una via di mezzo tra un centro studi e una scuola di giurisprudenza altamente specializzata, anche se in realtà appare una scatola vuota dalla funzione molto oscura.

A marzo del 2016, pochi giorni dopo aver iniziato la sua collaborazione con il comitato Trump e con la misteriosa LCILP, Papadopoulos venne mandato a Roma per partecipare a un evento non meglio specificato con uno dei partner della LCILP: la Link Campus University, un’università privata italiana fondata e presieduta dall’ex ministro Vincenzo Scotti e nota, tra le altre cose, per i numerosi corsi e master in sicurezza spesso frequentati da diplomatici, membri delle forze dell’ordine e dell’intelligence. La Link Campus University oggi è considerata da chi la conosce molto vicina ai dirigenti del Movimento 5 Stelle, che dal corpo docenti dell’università ha tratto ministri e sottosegretari, per esempio la ministra della Difesa Elisabetta Trenta.

Nel corso della sua visita del 2016 alla Link University, Papadopoulos conobbe l’altro protagonista di questa storia: Joseph Mifsud, un misterioso professore maltese, collaboratore della Link University, ma anche della LCILP e pieno di legami e conoscenze in tutto il mondo, dalla Fondazione Clinton al ministero degli Esteri russo, passando per amicizie e frequentazioni con persone collegate ai servizi di sicurezza e all’esercito russo (secondo quanto scoperto dall’FBI e pubblicato nel rapporto Mueller).

All’epoca del loro primo incontro Mifsud non fu colpito da Papadopoulos, ma cambiò idea quando venne a sapere che il giovane consulente faceva parte del comitato elettorale di Trump (l’annuncio ufficiale fu fatto dallo stesso Trump il 17 marzo 2016). Da quel momento i due cominciarono a scriversi e incontrarsi, soprattutto a Londra, in una relazione che proseguì per mesi. Il loro comune obiettivo – dicono le informazioni raccolte dagli investigatori statunitensi – era aprire un canale di comunicazione tra la campagna di Trump e il governo russo, allo scopo di arrivare, nella migliore delle ipotesi, a organizzare un incontro tra lo stesso Donald Trump e il presidente russo Vladimir Putin. Mifsud assicurava Papadopoulos di potergli procurare contatti di altissimo livello con il governo russo, contatti a cui il giovane consigliere era molto interessato perché gli avrebbero permesso di aumentare la sua importanza nel team di Trump.

Durante uno dei loro incontri a Londra, Mifsud si presentò accompagnato da una ragazza russa, Olga Polonskaya, che presentò come “nipote di Putin” e amica personale dell’ambasciatore russo a Londra. La sera stessa Papadopoulos scrisse una email ai capi del comitato elettorale di Trump, dicendo che la sua ricerca di contatti aveva ottenuto ottimi risultati grazie a un incontro con la “nipote di Putin” e con “l’ambasciatore russo a Londra”. In realtà Putin non ha nipoti: Polonskaya è un’ex manager di una società russa che si occupa di importazioni di vino. Era anche una studentessa della Link Campus. Mifsud, nella sua unica intervista data a Repubblica, ha smentito la versione dell’incontro data da Papadopoulos, ha sostenuto che non si parlò affatto di nipoti di Putin e che l’interesse di Papadopoulos per Polonskaya non avesse nulla a che fare con la politica, ma era «di tutt’altra natura».

Oggi sembra abbastanza sicuro che Mifsud abbia mentito a Repubblica. Nelle settimane successive all’incontro, Mifsud, Polonskaya e Papadopoulos continuarono a scambiarsi messaggi e email in cui parlavano della possibilità di aprire un canale di comunicazione tra il comitato di Trump e il governo russo con lo scopo di migliorare le relazioni tra i due paesi (gli investigatori statunitensi hanno scoperto che le bozze delle mail inviate da Polonskaya venivano prima riviste e corrette da Mifsud).

Ad aprile Mifsud mise in contatto Papadopoulos con un altro cittadino russo, questa volta con un ruolo più chiaro e noto all’interno dell’establishment governativo del paese: Ivan Timofeev, direttore dei corsi al RIAC, un centro studi fondato dal ministero degli Esteri russo. Timofeev e Papadopoulos si sentirono per mail e via Skype diverse volte e per parlare sempre sullo stesso argomento: l’intenzione da parte dei russi di stabilire legami con il comitato di Trump. Papadopoulos informava sistematicamente via email i capi dello staff di Trump riguardo i suoi incontri e la disponibilità e l’interesse dei russi a organizzare un incontro (in un paio di occasioni ci furono anche riunioni di persona, ma i capi del comitato rimasero sempre prudenti sul tema).

Anche se un canale di comunicazione diretto non venne mai aperto, Mifsud rivelò comunque a Papadopoulos delle informazioni che si sarebbero rivelate preziosissime. Il 25 aprile, durante un incontro all’Hotel Andaz di Londra, appena tornato da un viaggio in Russia, Mifsud raccontò a Papadopoulos di aver avuto una serie di colloqui con funzionari russi di alto livello. Durante uno di questi colloqui gli era stato rivelato che il governo russo era entrato in possesso di migliaia di mail compromettenti su Hillary Clinton, e che intendeva usarle.

Non è chiaro se Papadopoulos abbia riferito di questa rivelazione ai capi del comitato elettorale di Donald Trump. La maggior parte delle comunicazioni che aveva con loro avvenivano via mail, e tra le mail sequestrate dall’FBI non ce n’è nessuna in cui si parla delle mail rubate. È impossibile sapere se lo abbia fatto a voce; alcune parti del rapporto Mueller in cui viene affrontato l’argomento sono censurate; in ogni caso il rapporto dice che alcune persone coinvolte nell’indagine hanno cancellato messaggi e prove.

Quello che è sicuro è che meno di due mesi dopo l’incontro all’Hotel Andaz, i siti DC Leaks e Wikileaks iniziarono a pubblicare le quasi 20 mila mail che gli hacker russi avevano rubato al Comitato nazionale del Partito Democratico e al comitato Clinton. È certo che Papadopoulos parlò delle mail rubate con due diplomatici stranieri in due diverse occasioni: con un diplomatico greco e poi con quello australiano che con la sua denuncia contribuì a far partire il “Russiagate”.

Che fine ha fatto Mifsud?

In seguito alla denuncia del funzionario australiano, l’FBI interrogò Papadopoulos una prima volta. Il consigliere di Trump fece il nome di Mifsud, ma minimizzò il loro rapporto e il ruolo del professore. Quando cominciarono a emergere altri dettagli, alla fine del 2017, Papadopoulos venne accusato di aver mentito all’FBI e si dichiarò colpevole, subendo una lieve condanna. Mifsud nel frattempo è stato sentito una volta soltanto dall’FBI, nel febbraio del 2017, dopo il primo interrogatorio di Papadopoulos (oggi l’FBI dice che se Papadopoulos avesse chiarito maggiormente il ruolo di Mifsud, il professore sarebbe stato probabilmente arrestato).

Quando nell’ottobre del 2017 tutte queste informazioni cominciarono a diventare di dominio pubblico, Mifsud scomparve. Smise di rispondere al telefono e alle mail, fece perdere le sue tracce persino ai sui cari, come la compagna ucraina all’epoca incinta. La donna, che nel frattempo aveva partorito, è stata rintracciata nel febbraio del 2018 dal giornalista di BuzzFeed Alberto Nardelli. Sostiene che l’ultimo messaggio ricevuto da Mifsud risalga al 31 ottobre 2017, quando lui le chiese di non parlare con i giornalisti. Nardelli ha anche scoperto che Mifsud è ricercato anche dalla Corte dei Conti italiana per aver ricevuto un “ingiustificato compenso” per il breve periodo in cui venne nominato presidente del Consorzio universitario di Agrigento.

Da allora, nessuno è più riuscito a trovarlo: né l’FBI, che vorrebbe fargli molte più domande di quelle che riuscì a fargli nel febbraio del 2017, né la giustizia italiana né le decine di giornalisti che si sono occupati di questa storia per mesi. Sul Foglio di giovedì il giornalista Luciano Capone ha però raccontato che più o meno fino a maggio del 2018, cioè circa 7 mesi dopo la sua sparizione, Mifsud ha vissuto in un appartamento a Roma di proprietà di una diplomatica greca, ma affittato da una società collegata alla Link Campus University, la Link International. Per una curiosa bizzarria, lo stesso Mifsud è socio al 35 per cento di questa società.

L’università e il suo presidente, l’ex ministro Vincenzo Scotti, hanno sempre smentito di sapere dove si trovasse Mifsud dopo la sua sparizione e hanno cercato di minimizzare i suoi rapporti con l’università (nei giorni successivi alla sua sparizione, per esempio, hanno cancellato tutti i riferimenti al professore dal loro sito internet). Capone scrive però che le relazioni tra Link University e Mifsud erano invece particolarmente strette. Oltre a essere un importante socio di una società controllata dall’università, come abbiamo visto, Mifsud aveva anche procurato alla Link University una partnership con l’Università Lomonosov di Mosca, considerata la più prestigiosa università dell’ex Unione Sovietica.

Infine, come ha confermato la stessa Link, Mifsud aveva a disposizione un appartamento affittato dall’università fino al giugno-luglio 2018, e stando alle persone che vivevano nell’edificio ha continuato a frequentarlo almeno fino al maggio di quell’anno, sette mesi dopo la sua sparizione. Il fatto che la Link University appaia così reticente sul caso Mifsud ha contribuito a produrre ogni sorta di teoria.

Il fatto che l’università abbia rapporti con le forze di sicurezza e di intelligence italiane ha spinto molti sostenitori di Trump, tra cui lo stesso Papadopoulos e la sua compagna (che seguono e commentano frequentemente su Twitter le vicende dell’inchiesta), a sostenere che Mifsud sia stato nascosto dai servizi segreti italiani. Il professore maltese, secondo questa teoria, sarebbe stato utilizzato dai servizi segreti occidentali per cercare di incastrare Trump facendolo apparire un alleato o un burattino in mano alla Russia. Una volta esploso il caso, l’intelligence italiana avrebbe provveduto a nascondere Mifsud per evitare che la cospirazione venisse alla luce.

Tra i pochi che potrebbero smentire definitivamente queste ricostruzioni ci sono i colleghi, i collaboratori e gli amici di Mifsud alla Link Campus University. Sono loro che potrebbero spiegare, per esempio, se e nel caso perché l’università abbia continuato a ospitare Mifsud per sette mesi, pur negando di conoscere dove si trovasse. E possono probabilmente fornire preziose indicazioni per capire dove si trova oggi il professore, se è ancora vivo, quali erano davvero i suoi rapporti con il governo russo, se era una spia, un truffatore o se invece era un po’ di tutti e due. Nella storia del Russigate ci sono ancora parecchie domande aperte, spiega Capone: «Alcune risposte forse, più che negli Stati Uniti, conviene cercarle qui da noi. Nel governo italiano siedono due ex docenti della Link Campus, il ministro della Difesa Elisabetta Trenta e la viceminstra degli Esteri Manuela Del Re: a loro per prime spetterebbe il compito di fare ulteriore luce su questa vicenda».
During the years 1918 and 1919 Irish Republicans including Éamon de Valera were imprisoned in Lincoln Jail in England. In an extract from his book Peter’s Key – which details three Irish rebels’ daring escape – author Declan Dunne describes how de Valera and his associates turned the prison regime to their own ends.

They also lent a helping hand to their fellow-prisoners – including English pacifist Fenner Brockway, jailed for his anti-war stance:

FENNER BROCKWAY was an Englishman of high honour and principle. A dedicated pacifist, he opposed conscription and consequently was the recipient of white feathers from women whose boyfriends or relatives had enlisted to fight in the First World War. He was not moved by this – remarking, after a while, that he had accumulated enough white feathers to construct a fan.

He was imprisoned for his beliefs and for eight months up to April 1919, was placed in solitary confinement for twenty-three hours a day. No other prisoner was allowed into the exercise yard while he was taking his one hour of fresh air. He was subjected to one month of ‘bread and water treatment’ until a doctor would not allow any more. He made friends with a robin which, as he recalled, flew into his cell one ‘wonderful day!’ to feed from crumbs from his punishment rations.

It was during this time at Lincoln prison that he first made contact with the Irish internees. A prisoner who worked as a handyman and therefore could wander about the complex doing odd jobs appeared at his window one day. His name was ‘Trusty’. He was a remarkable-looking man: tall, broad and straight, with a leonine head of waving grey hair and a flowing beard.

‘We are Irishmen’

The following day Trusty delivered a little brown packet in which Brockway found a note, a pencil and a sheet of paper on which to reply. The note read: ‘Dear Brockway – Just heard you are here. What can we do for you? De Valera, Milroy and sixteen other Irish rebels are interned. We are Irishmen and can do anything you want – except get you out. Have your reply ready for “Trusty” when he calls tomorrow. Cheerio! Alasdair McCabe.’

When a number of Irish prisoners were released, one of them delivered a letter from Brockway to his wife, Lilla, who was looking after their two young daughters and living in hardship in a caravan. It was the only communication she received from her husband during his imprisonment.

Brockway also made out a list of newspapers he wanted; the Manchester Guardian, Labour Leader, New Statesman, Economist and Observer. Three days later, the deliveries began. Brockway lowered twine from his cell window, waited and hauled up the papers. Following a bout of illness, he was moved to a first floor cell where he worried that the paper round would end. When he went to the toilet the following day, he found a note projecting from a crevice between two bricks which instructed him to lift the cover from a drain-pipe.

There he found an edition of the Manchester Guardian. Cleaning the lavatories was one of Trusty’s duties and he always timed this task to ensure he could leave a newspaper for Brockway. This continued until Brockway’s term in prison ended.

Another Irish prisoner, Michael J Lennon, described Brockway as ‘a goodly man’ and dared not say how they had communicated with him. However, communicate with him they did. Lennon wrote a letter to Brockway when their prison ordeal was over saying, ‘Probably, you don’t remember me but I was in C14 [Cell 14] in Lincoln with you and read your weekly notes to A McCabe’. Indeed, Brockway did remember, recounting thirty-five years later, ‘It is true to say that [the Irish prisoners] saved my mind.’

Regime barbarity

This episode illustrates the gulf that existed, not between Brockway and the Irish prisoners, but between all of them and the barbarity of the prison regime that was honed and kept inhumane by the British government.

The Irish prisoners advanced their skill at subverting the prison system, identified its weaknesses and exploited them. James J. Dobbyn said that the warders treated the Irish internees as ‘arch enemies’ when they first arrived, believing that they were in league with Germany.

Dobbyn recalled that, as time went by and the prisoners were refused a public trial, the prison guards came to the conclusion that there was no German Plot and ‘turned the other way’.

The warders on patrol through the corridors of Lincoln prison at the time would have witnessed Seán Milroy puffing a cigarette and sketching in his cell; the flamboyant Paul Dawson Cusack, who on occasion cooked for the prisoners, complaining about the quality of vegetables; Samuel O’Flaherty explaining the synthetic inflectional forms of Greek verbs; Michael J Lennon calling ‘students’ to their Irish or Spanish classes; preparations for a musical evening with the performers rehearsing their recitations; Seán Etchingham elaborating on the finer points of horse-racing or yachting; Alasdair McCabe deep in thought while attempting to finish a chapter of his book on the economy

of Ireland; de Valera standing beside his gramophone and typewriter showing his profound knowledge of mathematics by studying quaternions – a number system that extends to complex numbers; and Laurence Lardner arguing with Thomas Ruane about a controversial point in Irish history in between games of handball.

John O’Mahony was inclined to invite the warders into his cell to give them a quick ‘snifter’ of one of the many bottles of whiskey he had squirrelled into the prison, while recounting a humorous yarn about his work as a travelling salesman and hotelier. The warders now had six MPs and a mayor under their charge. They could have been forgiven for thinking that planning a premature exit was not one of the prisoners’ preoccupations. They were wrong.

Most of us have a budget when we are thinking of buying a car. Some look for the cheapest unit in the desired segment. But, if budget allows, we suggest taking a value for money (VFM) approach. So, what is the value for money (VFM) approach? It simply means to look deeper into the unit, its options, its mileage, its internal and external condition, its engine status, etc. and put this information in the calculation, while deciding which Mitsubishi Starion price that you want to go for.

When you want to buy a Used Mitsubishi Starion for sale , it is good to know the catalogue price of the model. Especially for mid to high range cars, the package or grade of the car changes the price. On average, a car depreciates around 10% per year. This means, if you are buying a Price of Mitsubishi Starion, the price should be 50% of a new one. Note that, this is a very general calculation and after 6-7 years, this model does not work (10-year-old cars are not free).
Federal bill would ban ships that transport crude oil or persistent oil to or from ports on B.C.'s north coast.

VICTORIA — After waiting for months, the B.C. New Democrats this week finally got around to endorsing federal legislation that would enshrine a moratorium on oil tankers on the northern coast.

“Our government has been very clear we are committed to protecting our environment, the economy and our coast from the devastating impact a heavy oil spill would have,” said the statement Tuesday from Environment Minister George Heyman.

“We oppose the expansion of the movement of heavy oil through our coastal waters and we have been consistent in this position.”

Consistent, but not in any rush to formally declare that position on Bill C-48.

Short title: The Oil Tanker Moratorium Act. Long title (which pretty much says it all): “An Act respecting the regulation of vessels that transport crude oil or persistent oil to or from ports or marine installations located along British Columbia’s north coast.”

A de facto moratorium was proclaimed by parliament almost 50 years ago after initial controversy over the shipment of oil out of Alaska.

Legislation “formalizing” the ban was introduced two years ago by the federal Liberals, following up their opposition to the Northern Gateway Pipeline.

The bill has passed the House of Commons and is before the Senate, where the committee on transport and communications has been holding hearings on possible changes.

Those hearings, which were in Terrace on Wednesday, provided the pretext for the statement from Heyman.

But there was no overlooking the juxtaposition with political events on the other side of the Rockies.

For Bill C-48 is the same piece of federal legislation that was denounced earlier this month by Alberta’s NDP Premier Rachel Notley.

“There is a glaring double standard when it comes to this law,” she told the Senate committee. “This is not a tanker ban, it is an Alberta ban.”

She grounded her concern in the way the bill was deliberately crafted to block the shipment of Alberta oil and other petroleum products from the northeast coast of B.C.

Ottawa has contemplated no such ban on tanker shipments of oil through the St. Lawrence Seaway or to and from the east coast.

“No country produces its energy resources as safely and with the kind of attention to the climate as we do in Alberta,” she told the senate committee. “Bill C-48 is a disincentive to the very kind of investment we need to attract to Alberta.

“Toss C-48 in the garbage,” she advised. “It’s where it belongs.”

The premier delivered her remarks by video conferencing from Calgary on April 9, with one week to go in her bid for re-election.

As it happened, the B.C. government statement was issued on Alberta election day, a few hours before the polls closed.

Too late to have any influence on the outcome or even be noticed in Alberta amid all of the other distractions on that momentous election day.

Besides, Jason Kenney, now premier designate of Alberta, had already denounced the Notley pronouncement against C-48 as too little, too late.

Still, one had to wonder about the clumsy timing. Having waited for the better part of two years to declare a position on C-48, could the John Horgan government not have waited another 24 hours?

In terms of the optics, I was reminded of that incredible but true exchange last year involving Notley and Horgan.

It began with the B.C. premier saying he was looking forward to meeting with Notley at the May conference of the Western premiers.

“We have a disagreement on one issue,” said Horgan, referring to his opposition to — and her support for — expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline through B.C.

“Our values are in lockstep,” he told Postmedia’s Rob Shaw. “We have been friends for 20 years.”

But if the pipeline merely counted as “one issue” for Horgan, it was a matter of political life and death for Notley.

She announced she would be sitting out the Western Premiers conference, explaining that with the pipeline hanging in the balance, it was not the time for her to be discussing lesser agenda items like Pharmacare expansion and cannabis legalization.

“It would be surreal and exceptionally tone deaf for anyone to think we could politely discuss Pharmacare and cannabis when one of the players is hard at work trying to choke the economic lifeblood of the province and the country,” wrote Notley on Twitter.

Her communications chief, Cheryl Oates, then proceeded to clarify the status of the Horgan-Notley relationship so far as the premier of Alberta was concerned.

“They are not close friends and never were,” Oates told columnist Don Braid of the Calgary Herald. “They were just acquaintances who happened to work for the same organization.”

The organization in question was the B.C. NDP government of the 1990s, where both worked as political staffers. But as happens to the denizens of Facebook, Horgan found himself unfriended.

Against that backdrop, the B.C. NDP government’s ill-timed endorsement of a bill that Notley wanted tossed on the garbage heap was a mere footnote to a relationship already beyond rescue.

Still, it served as a reminder of how little thought Horgan gave to the predicament facing his NDP counterpart in Alberta.

Nor is Bill C-48 the only piece of federal legislation — branded as a “pipeline killer” on the other side of the mountains — that the B.C. New Democrats have endorsed recently. But that is a topic for another day.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PSNI released CCTV footage after Lyra McKee's murder

Two teenage men have been arrested in connection with the killing of journalist Lyra McKee.

The pair, aged 18 and 19, were detained under the Terrorism Act.

Ms McKee, 29, was shot as she was observing rioting in Londonderry in Northern Ireland on Thursday night.

It happened in the Creggan estate. Violence broke out after raids in the nationalist Mulroy Park and Galliagh areas by police investigating dissident republican activity.

Ms McKee was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle with other journalists when she was shot.

CCTV captured her final moments in the crowd and mobile phone footage showed the suspected gunman.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said a gunman fired shots towards police officers at about 23:00 BST on Thursday.

In the video, the masked attacker leans from behind cover and appears to fire shots towards police and onlookers.

There has been widespread condemnation of the killing.

At a vigil in Derry on Friday, Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, described her as a "tireless advocate and activist" for the LGBT community.

Ms Canning said her partner's dreams had been "snuffed out by a single barbaric act" and she had been left without "the woman I was planning to grow old with".

"The senseless murder of Lyra McKee has left a family without a beloved daughter, a sister, an aunt and a great-aunt; so many friends without their confidante," added Ms Canning.

"We are all poorer for the loss of Lyra."

PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, described Ms McKee's death as "senseless and appalling beyond belief".

As he appealed for information on Saturday, he said her killing had led to a "palpable change" in the community's support of the police.

"Yesterday we realised that the vast majority of communities across the whole of Northern Ireland support policing and support police and they support the peace process," he added.

"What we saw yesterday was the visible demonstration of that within the Creggan community. A community that has been very frightened for a long time and for a large part has been held to ransom by terrorist organisations that claims to represent them."

Ms McKee's killing came 21 years after the Good Friday peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland.

The 1998 peace deal marked the end of decades of violent conflict - known as the Troubles - involving republicans and loyalists during which about 3,600 people are estimated to have died.

The Good Friday Agreement was the result of intense negotiations involving the UK and Irish governments and Northern Ireland's political parties.

Figures from across the political divide, including Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and DUP leader Arlene Foster, were among the hundreds of people to attend the vigil.

One of Ms McKee's close friends, Kathleen Bradley, told the BBC: "Lyra was a voice - she wasn't afraid to stand up and hold her view.

"Lyra managed to get Mary Lou McDonald and Arlene Foster into Creggan [for the vigil] without any high security or barricades.

"Those politicians stood amongst us today and that really is the power of Lyra."

Other world figures united to condemn Ms McKee's killing.

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee "changed lives" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so.

"We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand," he added.

"This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms."

Former US President Bill Clinton said he was "heartbroken".

Irish President Michael D Higgins signed a condolence book at Belfast City Hall and said there was "outrage" in Ireland.

"The loss of a journalist at any time in any part of the world is an attack on truth itself," he said.

"The circumstances in which it happened - the firing on a police force that are seeking to defend the peace process - cannot be condoned by anybody."

The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted that Ms McKee's killing was a "reminder of how fragile peace still is in Northern Ireland".

"We must all work to preserve the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement," he said.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday signed into law a bill that bars local governments from establishing so-called right-to-work zones, another rebuke to his Republican predecessor, who blocked similar legislation as he battled with Democratic lawmakers over his pro-business, union-weakening agenda.

The new law, which was passed with strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate and takes effect immediately, “makes it abundantly clear that we have turned the page here in Illinois,” the Democratic governor said during a bill-signing event at the Capitol, where he was joined by legislators and labor leaders.

Former Gov. Bruce Rauner was a major proponent of laws prohibiting employers and labor organizations from signing contracts that require workers to join unions or pay dues. In 2017, Rauner vetoed a previous version of the bill banning local governments from creating such laws, and the House fell one vote short of overriding him. This time, the measure passed the House on a 101-8 vote and was approved unanimously in the Senate.

“From the start, right-to-work was an idea cooked up to lower wages, slash benefits and hurt our working families,” Pritzker said. “ ‘Right-to-work’ has always meant, ‘right to work for less money,’ and it’s wrong for Illinois.”

State lawmakers moved to ban local right-to-work laws after north suburban Lincolnshire passed one in 2015. The ordinance was overturned by a federal court, which ruled that federal law prohibits such local rules, but the village has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Pritzker said the new state law codifies rulings by lower federal courts.

“The law as it is does not allow a state to hand this responsibility down to the local communities,” he said. “This bill actually just establishes what is the law today, so I believe that would be moot, essentially, at the Supreme Court.”

Lincolnshire Village Manager Brad Burke did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.

State Sen. Ram Villivalam, a freshman Democrat from Chicago who sponsored the measure in the Senate, said it “makes it clear that the regulation of collective bargaining is the responsibility of state government.”

“It is an honor to stand here … today as we declare once and for all that right-to-work has no place in the state of Illinois,” Villivalam said.

The collective bargaining measure was the second time this week Pritzker signed a measure that had been vetoed by Rauner. On Sunday, the new governor signed a bill raising the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21 statewide, effective July 1.

In his first weeks in office, Pritzker signed a bill raising the statewide minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025. Rauner vetoed a $15 minimum wage bill in 2017.

During his campaign, Pritzker promised “he would want to be a voice for working families if elected,” said Jeffrey Collier, a union representative with the Edwardsville office of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 881.

Since taking office, Pritzker has made good on that promise, Collier said at the bill signing.

“In less than 100 days as governor, he has already done more than any other governor I’ve ever known to back up his word to support working families,” Collier said.

GEORGE TOWN: Police arrested two Nepali factory workers yesterday after they allegedly molested a 27-year-old female Grab driver on their trip in Bukit Mertajam.

In the 5.30pm incident yesterday, the two men had boarded the woman’s Proton Saga car at the Bukit Mertajam railway station for a trip to a housing area in Juru.

The Nepali men, aged 23 and 29, had sat at the back during the trip.

Halfway through the trip, the 23-year-old man crossed over to the front passenger seat near Jalan Song Ban Kheng.

The man then proceeded to hold the driver’s arm and kissed her hand. He then later pulled her body towards him and allegedly touched her breasts.

According to the complainant, the man molested her twice, despite repeated warnings that she would drive them to the police station if they continued to do so.

The man ignored her warnings and proceeded to embrace her.

As this was taking place, his fellow 29-year-old countryman in the backseat threw up.

The panicked woman stopped her car outside Masjid Lebai Tahir along Jalan Bukit Minyak and stepped out, asking for help. A group of men nearby then confronted the two men and started assaulting them.

The incident was caught on video by a by-passer, showing the two Nepali men lying semi-conscious and bloodied by the roadside.

The men were later brought to the Bukit Mertajam Hospital for treatment.

Central Seberang Perai district police chief Nik Ros Azhan Nik Abdul Hamid said the case is being investigated under Section 354 of the Penal Code for assault or use of criminal force to a person with the intent to outrage her modesty.

He said the duo had been detained under immigration laws for 14 days pending the verification of their travel documents.

Police are also waiting for a medical report to find out whether the two had consumed alcohol or were high on drugs.

In a sworn affidavit, copies of which were sent to the residences of 22 Supreme Court judges yesterday, a former employee of the Supreme Court of India accused the chief justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, of sexual harassment and persecution. The former employee describes two incidents of molestation by Gogoi in her affidavit, both of which allegedly took place in October 2018, only days after he was appointed to India’s highest judicial office. After she refused his alleged sexual advances, the former employee writes, she and her family faced “consistent persecution,” including the loss of their jobs and subsequently, arrest and torture in police custody. “I say that the CJI has misused his position, office and authority and abused his clout and power to influence the police,” she writes. “I have been victimised for resisting and refusing the unwanted sexual advances of the CJI and my entire family has also been victimised and harassed due to that.”

Along with her affidavit, the former employee also sent the judges copies of video recordings of several incidents she refers to in the document—in particular, that a Delhi Police official accompanied her to the CJI’s residence in January this year, where she was asked to apologise to his wife. The videos also indicate that Rajnath Singh, the union home minister, and Amulya Patnaik, the commissioner of the Delhi Police, were made aware of the incident at least as early as 11 January 2019.

In the affidavit, the former employee describes how, in the months preceding his ascension to the post of CJI, Gogoi took a special interest in her professional and personal life, eventually transferring her to his residential office on Tees January Marg, where she was asked to work with him at close quarters. She writes that on two separate occasions, on consecutive days, the CJI touched her and embraced her against her will. During one such incident, “I was forced to push him away with my hands,” she states. The former employee further writes that Gogoi instructed her to not speak about the alleged incidents with anyone, and threatened her with dire consequences if she did so.

In the four weeks following the alleged incidents, the former employee was transferred thrice to different sections within the Supreme Court. Towards the end of November, disciplinary proceedings were initiated against her. She was accused of having “acted in a manner prejudicial to discipline” for expressing her anxiety regarding her frequent transfers; trying to “bring influence and exert pressure from unacceptable quarters” for approaching a colleague to ask if a lack in her abilities had resulted in these frequent postings; and showing “insubordination, lack of devotion to duty and indiscipline” by taking a casual leave on a Saturday. She was dismissed from the Supreme Court on 21 December 2018. By the end of that year, her husband and his brother, both of whom worked with the Delhi Police, were also suspended from their respective jobs.

In March this year, Naveen Kumar, a resident of Jhajjar, Haryana, lodged a complaint against the former employee at Tilak Marg police station in Delhi, on the basis of which the police registered a first information report. According to Kumar, the former employee had defrauded him of Rs 50,000, which he claimed she took as part of a bribe, promising him a job at the Supreme Court in exchange. In her affidavit, the former employee termed Kumar’s charges as being “false, malicious and premeditated to harass and terrorise me and my family.” On 8 March, five days after the registration of the FIR, a team of policemen from the Tilak Marg police station arrived at the ancestral home of the former employee’s husband, in Rajasthan, where she was staying at the time, to take her into custody. She writes in her affidavit that when she went to the the police station the next day, as directed, accompanied by her family members, the police subjected them to torturous treatment: the SHO, she writes, handcuffed one of her legs to a sitting bench for a whole night, kicked her and verbally abused her. After that, she was sent to Tihar Jail for a day. The former employee was granted bail on 12 March. The next hearing in her case will be at the Patiala House Court today.
(CNN) A golfer and a horse are recovering after being injured in separate bobcat attacks in Connecticut on Thursday morning.

The attacks happened in Baltic, a small town close to the Rhode Island state line. The golfer was hurt at the Mohegan Sun Golf Course and the horse at a home nearby.

The golfer, in his late 60s, was near the seventh hole when he was attacked.

"It jumped on his back. He was able to fight it off with a golf club," Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection officer Chris Dwyer told CNN affiliate WFSB . "He thought it was dead. As he walked a few steps away, it ended up jumping back up and taking off on him."

Another member of the golfer's team was able to drive the bobcat off and the attacked golfer was transported to a hospital for treatment of lacerations. His condition is unknown.

About Audio Formats

Audio can be stored uncompressed, as with .aiff and .wav files. Lossless compression schemes, as used in .flac files, preserve the original sound quality by only removing unnecessary and redundant data. MP3, by far the most popular audio format, removes data using a lossy scheme which results in a slight loss of audio quality but significant compression. The AAC format is capable of better audio quality than MP3 in the general bit rate range, at the cost of less compression ability.
The NFL's best red-zone running backs in 2018

By Daniel Rymer • Apr 19, 2019

In today’s game, getting to the red zone is one thing, but the ability to finish strong and put points on the board is vitally important. Last season, these running backs performed well when they were in scoring position, making them the top-graded running backs in the red zone.

Derrick Henry took a while to get going last year, but when he did, he was nearly unstoppable. No one was better than Henry when within 20 yards of the end zone, as evidenced by his 88.6 overall grade on such plays. Henry totaled 157 yards after contact on 43 rushing attempts in the red zone last season, giving him the most yards after contact per attempt (3.65) at the position. He also ran for a first down or touchdown on 40% of his red-zone carries, ranking ninth out of 66 running backs with at least 10 red-zone attempts.

Jordan Howard had a relatively quiet year in Chicago, but he did help his team a ton in the red zone. On his 34 rushing attempts last season, Howard ran for a first down or a touchdown on 44% of his carries, which tied for third at the position. In addition to having a knack for moving the chains, Howard also averaged 2.09 yards after contact per attempt in the red zone, tying for 17th out of 66 qualifying running backs.

Last season, Hines averaged 2.18 yards after contact per attempt in the red zone, ranking 14th out of 66 running backs. The rookie also forced a missed tackle once every 0.18 red-zone attempts, tying for 16th at the position. His speed and toughness were a lethal combination in the red-zone last season, and the Colts could benefit by utilizing him more in 2019.

Phillip Lindsay took the league by storm last season, as he ran wild in Denver en route to over 1,000 rushing yards as an undrafted rookie. Despite his small frame (5’8”, 190 lbs.), Lindsay was still a force in the red zone, and he did most of his damage as a pass-catcher as his red-zone receiving grade of 74.9 ranked fourth among running backs. In addition, he also ran for a first down or touchdown on 34% of his red-zone carries, tying for 17th out of 66 players at the position.

Damien Williams was one of the Chiefs’ many weapons last season, and he was especially effective in the red zone as he was one of only two running backs who earned 70.0-plus red-zone grades as both a runner and a receiver. He also ran for a first down or touchdown on a whopping 47% of his red-zone attempts, ranking second among running backs.
Image copyright Getty Images/Manchester Museum Image caption Spider experts think the jumping spider (right) looks a bit like the famous caterpillar

A jumping spider has been named after Eric Carle, the author of children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar.

The arachnid was found by naturalist Stefan Obenauer in a Hong Kong park, who contacted Manchester Museum's Dr Dmitri Logunov for help identifying it.

After the spider expert found it was previously unknown, the name Uroballus carlei was given to it, because of similarities to Eric Carle's character.

Carle's book was first published in 1969 and has sold millions worldwide.

A spokesman for the museum said a Hong Kong lepidopterist had confirmed the area where the spider was found was home to a species of moth which has brown, bristly-haired caterpillars, which Uroballus carlei had most likely evolved to imitate.

He added that unlike Carle's caterpillar, it was not chocolate cake, cheese, salami or lollipops it eats but small insects such as flies and bugs.

Dr Logunov said jumping spiders "belong to the most diverse spider groups on Earth, accounting for more than 6,100 described species worldwide" and are "particularly notable for their complex courtship behaviour".
WASHINGTON — The 35-page dossier, spiced up with tales of prostitutes and spies, sketched out a hair-raising story more than two years ago. Russian intelligence had used bribery and blackmail to try to turn Donald J. Trump into a source and ally, it said, and the Kremlin was running some Trump campaign aides practically as agents.

But the release on Thursday of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, underscored what had grown clearer for months — that while many Trump aides had welcomed contacts with the Russians, some of the most sensational claims in the dossier appeared to be false, and others were impossible to prove. Mr. Mueller’s report contained over a dozen passing references to the document’s claims but no overall assessment of why so much did not check out.

Now the dossier — financed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and compiled by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele — is likely to face new, possibly harsh scrutiny from multiple inquiries.

Republicans in Congress have vowed to investigate. The Justice Department’s inspector general is considering whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation improperly relied on the dossier in applying to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant to eavesdrop on Carter Page, a Trump adviser. The inspector general wants to know what the F.B.I. learned about Mr. Steele’s sources and whether it disclosed any doubts about their veracity to the court.
BUFFALO — The other day at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a ball over the left field fence, over the bullpen that sits beyond it, over the large billboards situated above that, and into a parking lot some 450-feet away, Bobby Meacham thought of Steve Balboni.

See, Meacham and Balboni played at that triple-A park back in the 1980’s, when they were both in the New York Yankees system. Meacham was a wiry shortstop who’d eventually reach the majors thanks to his defence. Balboni was a thick first baseman who reached the majors because he hit some absolute bombs. When Guerrero hit his Wednesday, Meacham’s mind immediately flashed to one Balboni hit over the same wall.

“Balboni hit that one so far I had to actually get up out of my seat in the dugout and look up to see where it was going,” Meacham remembers, sitting in his office at Sahlen Field where he’s now Guerrero’s manager with the Buffalo Bisons. “It went way over the scoreboard. So, I thought, [Guerrero’s homer] is pretty good. But I saw Bonesy hit one farther than that.”

Meacham’s seen an awful lot. It’s what makes him a great minor-league manager, and one of the most influential voices the Blue Jays will hear from when it comes time to make a decision on promoting Guerrero to the majors. That decision is likely coming within days. Guerrero’s bat was major-league at this time last year, and he’s made strong strides in his defence and routines over the time since, two areas of particular concern for the club.

His footwork and first-step reactions at third base have improved, perhaps not enormously, but a respectable amount for a player whose body composition will almost certainly force him to the opposite infield corner before long. He’s lost 10 pounds and taken better care with his pre- and post-game conditioning since suffering a Grade 1 oblique strain this spring. He’s made measurable steps towards achieving the objectives the Blue Jays have set for him over the last several months, while the club slowly gained the contractual benefit of delaying the start of Guerrero’s major-league service clock in the meantime.

So, when is enough, enough? When does this uncommon young talent satisfy the many criteria the Blue Jays are awaiting before promoting him to the majors? When is Guerrero ready?

“It’s tough — it’s tough to figure out,” Meacham admits. “It’s one of those things where you try to feel around, and use your own experiences, and hopefully that wisdom rises.”

The experiences Meacham relies on go all the way back to when he was a minor-leaguer watching Balboni hit that bomb. Meacham remembers being in his first big-league camp with the Yankees and thinking he was much more talented than the infielders ahead of him on the club’s depth chart. But those infielders all had numerous years of experience in the majors. It’s exactly the scenario Guerrero was in with the Blue Jays this spring.

“I’m thinking, ‘How did this guy spend six, eight years in the big leagues? It couldn’t have been because he had more ability than somebody like myself,’” Meacham says. “It was because of what they knew already. What they’d experienced. How they dealt with everything. It’s more than just knowledge. It’s wisdom. And that comes from experiences and circumstances.”

Here’s one of those experiences — one of those circumstances. A week ago, during his first triple-A game this season, Guerrero crushed an RBI double to centre and immediately pulled off a delayed steal of third without a throw. The opposition’s third baseman was caught so off guard he barely moved.

What made the play so effective was the defence was playing an aggressive shift on a left-handed hitter, which pulled the third baseman off the line. It’s a situation Meacham had run through during spring training with a group of Blue Jays minor-leaguers ticketed for Buffalo, including Guerrero. Meacham had them all work on it a few times, and gave the players the green light to run if the circumstance ever presented itself in Buffalo.

Through the Bisons’ first 13 games, the opportunity was there a number of times. But no one even tried to pull it off until Guerrero. And this was in only his second triple-A plate appearance this season.

“That’s when somebody’s listening, watching, paying attention — and not afraid to go ahead and do it,” Meacham says. “That adds up into when you think a guy can be ready.

“When are they ready? When you tell them something and they’ve already experienced it — so, it clicks. Sometimes you tell guys something five, six times, and they don’t get it. But seven, eight, nine, they start to really get it. When you know that they’ve heard it enough, or they’ve experienced it enough, or they’ve paid attention enough, to where you tell them one more time and something clicks, you know they’re ready for that baserunning situation.”

Meacham tells another Guerrero story, but this one’s not flattering. It was back in Dunedin this spring and Guerrero was playing in a minor-league game, one of his first back in uniform after the oblique injury. He took one of his aggressive, vigorous swings at a hittable pitch and popped it straight up.

Frustrated with himself, Guerrero loafed it up the line rather than hustling to first base in the unlikely event the ball was dropped. Meacham was all over him.

“I get it. He was coming off his injury and he just wanted to be playing like normal — hitting every ball hard and getting ready for a season,” Meacham says. “He knew we were breaking camp soon and it’s almost like an opportunity to show that he’s ready. And now he pops up a couple pitches and he’s got to stay down there in Florida. I get it. But it doesn’t matter. I get your frustration. But I don’t care. You’ve got to run.”

That’s the kind of tendency Guerrero can’t carry to the majors. Even moreso, it’s the type of attitude. That’s because Guerrero will surely fail at some point. He’s going to face adversity. So far, he’s treated minor-league pitching like he’s playing a video game. But the list of players who have been able to do that in the majors is extremely brief.

And when Guerrero inevitably experiences extended failure at the major-league level, when he isn’t seeing the results he knows he can produce, he can’t let it affect other parts of his game like it did that day in Florida.

“I tell guys all the time, you can’t go up there and say, ‘Man, I know I should’ve been in this spot but I wasn’t on the cut-off for the relay,’” Meacham says. “You can’t do that up there.”

That’s what held Meacham down in the minors watching Balboni hit bombs for all those years while players he felt he was more talented than played for the Yankees. Sheer experience.

And that’s the catch-22 with Guerrero. At this stage in his career, in his life, there’s no way for him to have accumulated enough experience. He’s 20 years old. He’s played fewer than 300 minor-league games. But he’s undoubtedly talented enough to succeed in the majors today. So, what can Guerrero do?

“You just keep trying to put up numbers and make everybody’s decision harder — press them to decide whether you’re ready for the big leagues or not. And that’s what he’s doing,” Meacham says. “The key isn’t having that talent. The key is it translating and being substantial enough to carry you through the lows that they go through up there in the big leagues. It’s a different animal in the big leagues. It’s not the talent level that I’m considering. It’s an ‘is he ready’ issue. Because we would rather he stay there than have to come back.”
In the early ’90s, before Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, and before South Park redefined the way that animated children behaved, Comedy Central was a valuable resource for fans of stand-up comedy. Half-hour shows like Short Attention Span Theater and Stand Up Stand Up introduced viewers to up-and-coming comedians in brief clips, essentially chopping up full routines for the sake of spreading them out over hours of programming. For many people, it was the first time that they’d be introduced to today’s biggest stars, like Stewart and Louis C.K.

That said, when a software developer and former teacher named Tom Snyder (not the late talk show host) met a talented stand-up comic named Jonathan Katz, they decided to develop an animated series together… an unlikely pairing, to say the least. Snyder had already pitched a show about a therapist, and Katz accepted the role of a therapist who treated a variety of hilarious patients, played by popular stand-up comics.

The series became Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist and, in 1995, it was one of the first original programs that Comedy Central would air. It didn’t matter that this group of people had very little experience in animation because, when the right people find each other, magic happens. To get the story of how this Emmy and Peabody award-winning series came to be, we spoke to Snyder, Katz, and many of the other key players involved in the show. Enjoy.
Who would want to be Alberta’s next energy minister?

The United Conservative Party’s oil and gas agenda is extensive, and it looks like a migraine-inducing slog for the next energy boss.

The industry’s issues — from pipelines and oil curtailment, to climate considerations and electricity reform — are as complicated as quantum physics.

Many of the key levers for success are beyond the province’s control.

While the energy minister holds one of the most powerful seats at the cabinet table, it’s also one of the trickiest, with an array of competing interests and demands.

“It’s an extremely important job, because it’s our resources,” said Rick Orman, an oilman who became a Progressive Conservative energy minister in the 1980s and early ’90s.

“It’s complicated and it’s multi-faceted . . . If you have a background in the industry, a grounding in the industry, that gives you a leg up to hit the ground running.”

Finding the right energy minister will be one of the most important cabinet decisions for Jason Kenney.

The premier-designate has several candidates in his 63-seat caucus who could fill the job, although two logical options — Calgary MLAs Sonya Savage and Prasad Panda — already have extensive energy experience, noted Orman.

Savage, the rookie MLA for Calgary-North West, has been on the front lines of some of the most intense energy battles in the country.

A lawyer by training, she worked in the pipeline sector for nine years at Enbridge, including on the Northern Gateway project that was effectively killed by the Trudeau government’s oil tanker ban off the northern British Columbia coast.

As senior director of policy and regulatory affairs at the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association since 2015 — a job she left this week — Savage toiled on the hot-button issue of Bill C-69.

The federal Impact Assessment Act has become one of the main targets of Kenney’s wrath toward Ottawa.

Asked if she hopes to become energy minister, Savage said Wednesday she’s concentrating on getting her campaign office cleared out and will take on whatever role the incoming premier wants her to fill.

But she doesn’t miss a beat when queried on the priorities to get Alberta’s energy industry moving.

“It’s to send a signal to investors that we are open for business, that we are welcoming back investment, that we will be competitive and that energy policy will be made in Alberta again — and not in Ottawa,” she said.

Repealing the carbon tax, reducing regulations, cutting the corporate tax rate and putting in legislated timelines at the Alberta Energy Regulator are also on the party’s agenda. Such moves will send an immediate signal to the investment community, she said.

As for Bill C-69, which will change the way major energy projects are reviewed by the federal government, Savage has strong opinions.

The UCP has promised to file a court challenge against the bill if it passes, arguing C-69 impedes on the province’s jurisdiction over oil and gas production.

“We really think it goes a big step into our constitutional jurisdiction and nobody has pushed back until now,” she said.

Panda, the MLA for Calgary-Edgemont, is another obvious candidate for the post.

First elected as a Wildrose MLA in a 2015 byelection, he served as the economic development and trade critic before becoming the UCP’s energy critic in 2017.

As an engineer, he spent 28 years in the energy sector, including 11 with Calgary-based Suncor Energy. Before entering politics, Panda worked on the company’s major project teams, which were involved in building pipelines and oilsands facilities.

Getting oilpatch companies to reinvest and create jobs will be a key priority for the government, he said, noting it will be up to the premier and caucus to decide what policies are pursued.

“Our focus is how to get these companies to hire people immediately, so that means they have to expand,” he said.

“I think that would be the priority, (while) at the same time, simultaneously fight for pipelines and to stand up for Alberta.”

Energy issues dominated much of the UCP’s economic discussion during the campaign, including plans to take on foreign-funded anti-energy groups and scrap the NDP’s crude-by-rail plan.

Proclaiming Bill 12, which would give the province the powers to restrict energy shipments to British Columbia, will be one of the first things the new government will do.

The UCP made a number of other promises that will overhaul the electricity sector, another area that falls under the energy portfolio.

The NDP’s plan to have renewable energy make up 30 per cent of Alberta’s power generation by 2030 will be abandoned, along with the province providing subsidies to future wind and solar projects.

The party also pledged to consult with the power industry and report back within 90 days on whether the province should continue with the planned shift to an electricity capacity market or remain with the current structure.

“The turmoil was introduced by the NDP,” Panda said. “We will review whether the capacity market is required.”

UCP insiders believe Savage and Panda will be top candidates for the energy post, although cabinet-making is an art, not a science, and there could be other options under consideration.

Whoever gets the job, Orman believes the next energy minister will have to buckle up for a wild, but satisfying, ride.

“You have to be willing to work your butt off and . . . have your wits about you,” he added.

“You have to exude confidence and show people, there’s a new sheriff in town.”

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region — Turkey needs more democracy to pull itself out of even "deeper political and economic crises" following a "humiliating" electoral defeat of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) in last month's elections, opined a prominent jailed Kurdish politician.



"The only way to avoid the looming economic crisis — especially soaring unemployment and rising inflation — is to urgently implement democratic political reform," wrote Selahattin Demirtas, the former co-chair of the Peoples' Democratic Party in The Washington Post on Friday.



The article was Demirtas' first wide-ranging opinion piece published in Western media since Turkey held municipal and local elections on March 31.



"We believe that these elections have shown the way forward. If the government continues its authoritarian course, however, I worry that deeper political and economic crises are on the way," he added.



The AKP lost the posts of mayor to the largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), in Istanbul officially, and in Ankara and Izmir unofficially.



Erdogan was formerly the mayor of Istanbul. Former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was beaten out by Ekrem Imamoglu in Istanbul. Prior to the elections, the smaller HDP "strategically" encouraged its supporters to vote for opposition candidates, particularly in large cities.



The election was largely viewed as a referendum on AKP dominance in the country.



"Erdogan, who rightly viewed the elections as a referendum on his rule, suffered a humiliating defeat. His party lost control of five of the largest cities in the country..." wrote Demirtas.



There was no immediate response from the AKP. When Demirtas has previously written scathing pieces, the AKP has rarely directly responded.



Demirtas has been jailed since 2016 on various charges including having ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party. He faces more than 140 years in prison if found guilty on all counts.



Demirtas argues that "thousands of members of the [HDP] should currently be participating in politics — including me — are in prison on political grounds"



He also argues that politicians like him who are "deemed 'terrorists' by government officials" need to play a greater role in Turkey's political landscape, as evidenced by the recent election results.



"Current developments in the Middle East (and especially Syria) show clearly what course Turkey must follow: We must strive for unity and social cohesion. We can achieve this end only by rallying around the principles of peace and democracy," wrote Demirtas.



The Kurdish politician is jailed in Erdine Prison. He communicates with media through a lawyer.



The HDP views the losses by the AKP as a positive; however, the former lost in some of its perceived strongholds such as Sirnak. It did retain Diyarbakir's mayorship after their candidate was cleared in an investigation.



Final, official election results have not been fully approved across the country by Turkey's Supreme Electoral Council (YSK).



The Council of Europe is encouraging Turkey to finalize the process "to implement the decisions taken by the voters."






Charli XCX helps Carly Rae Jepsen finish her album

Carly, you have a lovely voice. She's got an amazing voice.

That was the first time you said yours.

And it's funny now. It was a joke, but I think you are a good listener. I can turn my power to any song I want and still have to make it sound convincing.

That's why Carly Rae jxxz was so disappointed when she died last year. A lot of people were so happy. We were all on our way to an engagement. We could finally be happy and happy.

It's hard to hear myself. I was telling my mom after she hit it off that she had a stroke and was on the verge of losing her job because of it one day. Now we all hear the story, but it's much longer than it was before because I forgot to tell you.

I told Carly Rae, she was happy. The truth was, she was going to die without me because of my voice. But if you tell me she was so happy, where's my life coming from?

Well, that's not how things are supposed to go. I can do anything. You can help make that happen. I can have a normal life as well.

I have no money, no family, no friends, and nothing to give. I am the only one who can control my dreams, my life. I am the only one that can stop the powers from manifesting, that is unless there are powerful enough to stop it. It's kind of sick and I love you, but I could do better.

I could stop your life, or it could keep it going until your wife dies and your kids grow up. And I could stop your life if you help the world. I could stop your entire life from happening, because I am so strong, the only thing that stands in my way is what Carly Rae has going for me.

I can turn my powers away. I can't let your wife die without me, now. I just know that this is the only way I can do any good for you. I feel like I could give even you a big rock if you'd listen to me.

So listen please. It's just going to be another day.

I love you,

Carly Rae Jepsen

I love you too.

Love,

C. Wright

I love you.

I love you.

A renewable bioplastic made from squid proteins

December 18, 2014 , December 18, 2014 , Pennsylvania State University

A thermoplastic made of squid protein can be stretched up to 300%. Credit: Penn State

In the central Northern Pacific is an area that may be the size of Texas called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Made up of tons of floating plastic debris, the patch is killing seabirds and poisoning marine life in the North Pacific Ocean and in other oceans where converging currents, called gyres, concentrate the floating plastic. Over time, plastic bottles and fishing lines from coastal locations and seagoing vessels break down into nearly invisible pieces small enough to enter the food chain where some of the chemicals may eventually be ingested by human beings.

At Penn State, a group led by Melik Demirel, professor of engineering science and mechanics, is designing a biodegradable plastic from structural proteins that could help clean up the world's oceans and solve an interesting set of other problems along the way.

Demirel and his students have gathered squids from around the world, from the Atlantic coast, the coast of Spain, from Korea, and later this year, from Argentina. From these specimens, his lab has extracted the squid ring teeth (SRT) from their tentacles, and re-engineered their proteins in ways that go beyond nature. He plans to find ways to biosynthesize the engineered protein in bacteria through fermentation on an industrial scale. And though that may be a few years down the road, it is entirely feasible, he believes. "Structural proteins are eco-friendly materials with remarkable mechanical properties," he says. "It's a material that looks a lot like silk, except that it is thermoplastic, which means that it can be melted and reshaped into different forms without losing its properties. Like silk, SRT is lightweight and strong, which is why the Army is interested in the material for textiles."

The convergence of materials and life sciences

In the Demirel lab, graduate student Abdon Pena-Francesch removes the protein from the suction cups on the squid's tentacle using a toothpick. He then processes the protein into a viscous melt at a temperature above its softening temperature, around body temperature in water. The melt could be used in a number of industrial processes, such as electrospinning, extrusion, molding, or by coating onto a surface. A new and potentially dramatic way to use the protein melt is in 3D printing.

"The squid protein Abdon is working with can be melted and solidified over and over without losing its mechanical properties, which include high toughness (how much energy it can absorb), high strength (the load that can be borne before failure, around one gigapascal), and its extensibility (how far can it be stretched before breaking), which can be engineered up to 300%," Demirel says. In addition, this fibrous protein can be chemically functionalized and can be controlled so as to biodegrade in anywhere from hours to years. This makes squid protein a good prospect for packaging, such as plastic bottles, or timed-release drug delivery.

With so many potential advantages to using a safe, recyclable, biodegradable, composite material, there is still a big roadblock, says Demirel. That is the processing of the tiny rings is slow and expensive and there are not enough squids in the ocean for an industrial scale material. In order to compete with plastics that are a byproduct of relatively cheap oil extraction, a better method for producing these proteins is required.

This is where materials science and life sciences begin to converge, Demirel says. Genes coding squid proteins were read by sequencing instruments in the Genomics Facility at Penn State. Once Demirel's team obtained the genomic data, they had to find out which portions of the data actually contain the code for protein formation. For this they took their data to the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility at Penn State. Both facilities are operated by the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences.

"At the Proteomics Facility, we read the sequence of the protein. The problem is the mass spectrometer can only read a small portion of the sequence at a time. That's when bioinformatics people step in, such as Dr. Istvan Albert and his Bioinformatics Consulting Center in the Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology," Demirel says. "They start building the whole map, put it into bacteria and express it."

There are multiple systems for biologically synthesizing the squid proteins into a plant or animal system. These include bacteria, yeast, mammal, plant, or insect systems. Demirel currently works with Wayne Curtis, professor of chemical engineering, to express the protein in bacteria. Bacteria are already in use to make high-end products such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

There are several proteins in squid tentacles, some of which show thermoplastic properties and others elastic properties. The ratio of these proteins is distributed differently in each of the species. This gives his group a large canvas of properties to work with.

"Now we can go beyond nature, because we can take each of these proteins and mix them as we wish. We can mix within species or we can mix across species. We know by theory that depending on their molecular weight they will either be all thermoplastic or all thermoelastic. By mixing the molecular weight you get something in between," says Demirel. His group is already producing on the order of 100s of grams of protein. Their goal is to produce kilograms by the end of this year, and then, in the next couple of years, tons. Eventually with Wayne Curtis' expertise, he proposes to make a thermoplastic elastomer that is competitive with synthetic oil-based plastic.

In the lab, Pena-Francesch coats a glass slide with a squid protein and sets a second glass slide on top of it. The two slides bond, and it takes a powerful pressure to pull them apart. The adhesive is stable underwater for at least six months and could be used for a marine coating or for bandages for wound healing. The fibrous protein can be reformed several times and retains its elasticity or stiffness in wet or dry conditions.

Next, he stretches a small strand of elastomer protein with small pliers until it finally snaps. To demonstrate the material's self-healing property, Pena-Francesch heats the broken strands above its softening temperature and rejoins the ends seamlessly.

"We are in the process of taking something from nature, reproducing it, and mimicking it using gene sequences to get properties that materials scientists are interested in, such as specific physical properties including surface, mechanical, and barrier properties," Demirel says.

April 19, 2019, 8:32 AM UTC By Michael Conway, Former counsel, U.S. House Judiciary Committee

Special Counsel Robert Mueller's redacted final report explicitly chose not to decide if President Donald Trump had committed criminal obstruction of justice. But Mueller's detailed factual findings paints a damning portrait of a president repeatedly trying — sometimes successfully, and sometimes not — to hinder, if not derail, the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

In the 182-page detailed analysis of the facts and legal standard to prove obstruction of justice, Mueller examines 10 separate incidents in which the president's actions could be viewed as obstruction of justice. Tellingly, an obstruction effort need not be successful to be a federal crime: A person is guilty if he or she "obstructs, influences or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so."

The president's actions at that time included: firing FBI Director James Comey, after seeking to have him drop the investigation of national security adviser Michael Flynn; telling White House counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller and then, following accurate press reports about Trump's order, directing McGahn to falsely deny the story; and demanding that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescind his recusal, among others.

(McGahn's refusal to fire Mueller was, according to his testimony, to avoid being "a Saturday Night Massacre Bork" — referring to Robert Bork, the solicitor general who fired Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox during the Watergate investigation and later found his actions that night an indelible stain on his legal reputation.)

Despite Barr's initial contention that Mueller declined to recommend prosecution of the president for obstruction because of difficult issues regarding his actions and intent, the decision was foreordained by Mueller's explicit adherence to the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel's policy statement that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller acknowledged that, as a department employee, he had to accept the legal conclusion of the department. Mueller concluded that, if his report even suggested that President Trump could otherwise face federal charges, that would not be fair because the president could never clear himself (as would happen if a jury found him "not guilty") since there would never be a trial.

Of course, that policy did not bar Mueller from exonerating the president, if that is what the facts warranted. He did not do that, saying the investigation "does not exonerate him."

Mueller also dismissed the option of charging the president in a sealed indictment to be released after Trump left office, for fear that the indictment would be leaked and the stigma would undermine the president's ability to govern.

When viewed in the context of Mueller's reliance on a Justice Department policy that immunizes the president from criminal prosecution, the facts compellingly mustered in his report show the real criminal exposure that would be faced by any person who is not the president.

Mueller correctly stated that an obstruction of justice requires the accused to have acted with a corrupt intent. Mueller sought a voluntary interview with the President but the report stated that "After more than a year of discussion the president declined to be interviewed." (Surprisingly the next three lines of the report are redacted on the basis of grand jury information.)

President Trump did answer written questions, but none of those related to the obstruction of justice prong of the investigation. Mueller said that he had the authority to issue a grand jury subpoena for President Trump to testify under oath, but concluded that the ensuing legal fight would cause a "substantial delay" in completing his work. So Mueller gave up on trying to discern Trump's intent from the horse's mouth.

The successful stonewalling by President Trump puts the lie to Barr's statement that the White House had fully cooperated with the investigation. Trump's refusal to testify put up a greater barrier to Mueller's decision-making about obstruction than might have been anticipated.

Still, even without Trump's testimony, Mueller acknowledged that circumstantial evidence could have supported an obstruction charge. And, contrary to William Barr's legal position, Mueller concluded that a person can criminally interfere with an investigation even if no underlying crime is ever proven. This makes legal sense: A person is guilty of obstruction if he urges a witness to lie to an FBI agent at the outset of an investigation, even if the prosecutor never indicts anyone for the incident under investigation.

Mueller made another important point in noting that person's motives in hindering an investigation may also be based upon "avoiding financial liability or preventing personal embarrassment," If President Trump were interfering with the Special Counsel's investigation for fear of disclosure of Trump organization business dealings or unethical behavior of him or his associates, rather than because of any conspiracy being investigated, that would still be a crime.

Hamstrung by the departmental policy that the president cannot be indicted, Mueller chose not to make a recommendation. Instead he laid out the facts for Congress and the public to evaluate and, if appropriate, to act. In a telling reference on the first page of the obstruction of justice section of report, Mueller wrote, "We recognize that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting president would place burdens on the president's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential conduct."

What constitutional process is that exactly? The footnote following that sentence said "discussing the relationship between impeachment and the criminal prosecution of a sitting president."

Mueller has completed his investigation. Whether the president obstructed justice will not be decided by Barr's refusal to indict Trump, but rather the conclusions of Congress and the public in either impeachment proceedings — or the ballot box in 2020.
As Missouri cracks down on abortion access, we visited the only clinic in the state that still performs the procedure.

sabrina tavernise So why don’t I start — if you can introduce yourself and say your name. vivian zwick O.K. Well, my name’s Vivian Zwick, and I’m 101 years old. And I came to this issue quite a long time ago. sabrina tavernise Did you know about abortion? vivian zwick No, I’d heard about it, but I really didn’t know much about it. I didn’t start really working for it until about the early ‘60s, just the time that Governor Rockefeller in New York signed the bill to have abortion available to everybody — not in Missouri, but in New York State. So we were just delighted that there was actually a place where you could get an abortion here in America. You know, before that, if you were a rich woman, you could go to Europe. But if you were a poor woman, you couldn’t. So we were sending people to New York. It was pretty underground. sabrina tavernise Does that seem — when you look back on it now, does that seem like an earlier time that just feels very old fashioned and distant? vivian zwick I’m afraid not.

sabrina tavernise “Daily” producer Lynsea Garrison and I went there to see how this was all playing out on the ground. Our first stop: Missouri.

speaker 1 You know, it’s very hard to go out and be like, oh, I don’t believe in this. But I don’t believe in it. I don’t, and that’s why I’m out here. speaker 2 I don’t think everybody understands how dire a situation that we’re in. speaker 3 The pro-life movement is winning.

lynsea garrison Chapter 1. “The Movement.”

brian westbrook Hi sir, how are you today?

lynsea garrison Brian Westbrook spends a lot of time on this sidewalk.

brian westbrook Hey. Good morning, ma’am. How are you?

lynsea garrison It’s his full-time job.

brian westbrook It’s a beautiful day. Would you like a beautiful rose?

lynsea garrison He comes here sometimes by himself, sometimes with his interns. And he sits for hours in this camping chair to wait for people to pass through the gate.

brian westbrook What’s that? speaker The heat. brian westbrook The heat? Yeah, I know. I know.

lynsea garrison He’s young. He’s in his 30s.

brian westbrook Yes, ma’am.

lynsea garrison He’s clean-cut, kind of preppy-looking. He kind of looks like an upbeat parking attendant.

brian westbrook I’m Brian. I’ll take care of you out here. No big deal. Oh, I got a rose! Do you want a rose?

lynsea garrison But Brian doesn’t work for Planned Parenthood.

[music]

brian westbrook If you don’t go where abortions happen, Planned Parenthood might as well hang up a sign saying, open with the blessing of the Christian community. If we’re not there, there’s no one opposing them. And we need to oppose them, because we don’t agree.

lynsea garrison Brian is the executive director for the Coalition for Life in St. Louis. And over the past eight years, he says he’s persuaded hundreds of women to keep their pregnancies. He calls them turnarounds.

archived recording The man, the myth, the legend. We all know him — the great Brian Westbrook. So put your hands together. [APPLAUSE]

lynsea garrison And Brian Westbrook — he’s kind of a rock star in Missouri’s pro-life movement.

archived recording (brian westbrook) How is everybody? archived recording Good.

lynsea garrison In a state that’s developed some of the most innovative ways to chip away at abortion access.

archived recording 1 Missouri lawmakers passed a law back in May that cuts off all funding for services associated with a abortion facility. archived recording 2 New legislation to outlaw all abortion in Missouri. archived recording 3 It would make it nearly impossible for a woman in Missouri to get an abortion. And just hours ago, it cleared a major hurdle toward becoming a reality.

lynsea garrison But Missouri is most famous for one particular invention — a requirement that doctors have admitting rights at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. The latest version of this law passed in 2005, shut down most of the rural clinics in the state who couldn’t meet that requirement. It was such a game changer that pro-life legislators around the country used it as a blueprint — North Dakota, Utah, Louisiana.

archived recording Clinics are fighting the law before it forces many places to close down.

lynsea garrison And in Texas, but the law was challenged. And it went all the way up to the Supreme Court in one of the biggest cases on abortion in recent history.

archived recording Supporters have said, had the court gone the other way, that essentially would’ve made it almost impossible, certainly in the state of Texas, for most women to have an abortion, because it would have forced those clinics to close. This decision was written by Justice Stephen Breyer.

lynsea garrison Since Roe v. Wade was decided, there have been at least 20 abortion cases that have made their way to the Supreme Court. Six of them came out of Missouri, this petri dish of abortion regulation.

archived recording (brian westbrook) I encourage you to go out, to evangelize, to pray.

lynsea garrison And that’s why there’s only one clinic left in Missouri. And that clinic is hanging on by a thread.

archived recording (brian westbrook) They do about 6,000 abortions right here, right down the street, here in our local community.

lynsea garrison It nearly closed last year when it lost its state funding. Right now, it’s kept open by donors.

archived recording (brian westbrook) But my staff is mostly here. Some of them are actually on the sidewalk right now, impacting girls as they drive into that abortion facility.

lynsea garrison So to pro-lifers like Brian, that feels like winning.

archived recording (brian westbrook) So you want to meet that person where they’re at, say yes, I know it’s legal and it is absolutely your choice. But I know there’s a better choice for you. So I ask you to keep going, be fervent in your resolve. And one day, we will see an end to abortion here in St. Louis. God bless you guys. [APPLAUSE]

lynsea garrison And being on the winning team, it shows.

brian westbrook How are you, my friend? speaker Fine. How are you? brian westbrook Doing great. Doing great.

lynsea garrison In the near-decade of being on the sidewalk, Brian has perfected his approach. He saw the way most anti-abortion protesters were on the sidewalk, the ones who shouted and intimidated women, waving graphic images of aborted fetuses. And he wanted to find a new way.

brian westbrook If I was an abortion-bound woman, which I’m not, why would I stop?

lynsea garrison And this is where he landed.

brian westbrook Hey, good morning. Good to see you today. Hi, sir, how are you today? Hey. Good morning, ma’am. How are you? Oh, I didn’t give her a rose! Hey, how about a rose for you? speaker I’m going to want some more. I’ll take one. brian westbrook White or red? White or red? speaker White. brian westbrook You’ve got it. Have a great one, ma’am. speaker You too.

lynsea garrison But for Brian, this isn’t just about the image of friendliness. This is a numbers game to get as many turnarounds as possible.

brian westbrook Turnaround is defined as a woman who is going there for a pregnancy test, ultrasound or an abortion. We’re talking to her, whether it’s in the driveway or at the fence, and we ask her to leave. And she decides to leave immediately and go receive services from somewhere else. speaker You say, hey, what’s up? I’m with another organization offering free local resources. This is a coupon for a free ultrasound, free pregnancy tests, and free S.T.D. tests. It helps to talk fast. [LAUGHING] Don’t you think?

lynsea garrison Brian constantly refines his techniques. He takes meticulous notes on what seems to work.

brian westbrook What doesn’t work? What would run more efficiently?

lynsea garrison Which cars slow down.

brian westbrook How many people we can get to stop.

lynsea garrison Why they slow down.

brian westbrook How many people leave.

lynsea garrison Who takes brochure.

brian westbrook How many people are —

lynsea garrison What he was wearing when they took those brochures.

brian westbrook That person did not stop and talk to me. Why didn’t they stop and talk to me? speaker We just keep track of stats — so if people stop and talk to us, things like that. lynsea garrison Is it like an Excel spreadsheet on your iPad? speaker Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. lynsea garrison Oh, wow. speaker Yup. brian westbrook It’s an app that already exists, and then we just modified it to fit our needs.

lynsea garrison And he calls all of this “the data.”

brian westbrook No, there’s actually not very many pro-life sidewalk counseling apps that exist. Who knew, right?

lynsea garrison And based on the data, here’s what he’s figured out.

[music]

lynsea garrison The first rule of what he calls sidewalk counseling is you do not talk about sidewalk counseling.

brian westbrook You shouldn’t wear a pro-life T-shirt. Don’t wear a bunch of pro-life material while you’re out there. Our signage, for instance, doesn’t mention abortion. Don’t talk about baby or the pregnancy or anything else.

lynsea garrison Number two —

brian westbrook Physics.

lynsea garrison Demonstrate authority when approaching a car.

brian westbrook A lot of pro-lifers will walk with the car, kind of chase the car, as they go in. Instead, we’ll take one minor step towards the car in kind of an authoritative posture. And so subconsciously, they will slow down. And they’ll stop and figure out what we want to talk about.

lynsea garrison Number three, be approachable.

brian westbrook So there are no graphic images. There’s no yelling. There’s no screaming. Waving with your left hand versus your right hand — as they’re driving, they’re making a right-hand turn. My left hand — I make myself just a little bit bigger, and I’m more approachable.

lynsea garrison No hats. No dark makeup.

brian westbrook Basic sales and marketing is that you shouldn’t shade your eyes. Again, it’s more about removing versus adding. Simplifying — it’s really about simplifying. That’s what the data tells me. speaker Hey there, were you able to receive any of our information on free resources? O.K., this is a coupon. I’m with a local organization. I really like your nails. Those are cute. O.K. brian westbrook Now, if more people stopped with graphic images, then I would use graphic images. But less people stop when you use graphic images. You have to define your strategies, your techniques, everything in terms of your audience. And your audience is the driver. speaker O.K. So that’s a coupon for a free pregnancy test.

lynsea garrison And he says it’s working. He points to the fact that abortions are down in the state, and his turnaround numbers are up. They only seem to be getting higher.

brian westbrook Our first year, we had 15 turnarounds. Since then, we’ve had 2,200 turnarounds.

lynsea garrison So to Brian, that’s 2,200 babies saved.

speaker And a lot of people don’t consider this a social justice issue, but it is one.

lynsea garrison And he’s passing those lessons on to the next generation.

speaker Yeah. So just let us know if we can help you. All right? brian westbrook Two things — so instead of “let us know,” because that’s always, like, the typical thing, more about “come out and talk with us.” speaker Yes. Yeah. brian westbrook “Come out and talk to us,” because it’s more definitive. speaker Right. brian westbrook And then as they’re driving away, “give us a call” instead of “let us know.” speaker Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah.

lynsea garrison As we’re standing there, one of the clinic’s doctors pulls through the gate, and Brian spots him.

brian westbrook That’s David Eisenberg. So he’s the abortionist today. So they’re most likely doing abortions. So —

lynsea garrison As the doctor parks his car and calmly walks through the parking lot, Brian turns up the charm offensive.

brian westbrook Dr. Eisenberg, it’s good to see you today. It’s a beautiful day.

lynsea garrison And Dr. Eisenberg doesn’t even look up.

brian westbrook Have a good one, sir.

[music]

brian westbrook How are you, my friend?

lynsea garrison It’s this really weird game. If Brian and his movement are on the offense in Missouri, working to become the first state in the nation to outlaw abortion, the doctors, the staff, the escorts — they’re playing this hard defense, fighting as hard as they can. But out here, it feels like only a matter of time.

brian westbrook Hey, good morning. speaker Would you like a coupon? brian westbrook Ma’am, how are you today?

sabrina tavernise After the break, the doctors.

brian westbrook Dr. Eisenberg, good to see you today. It’s a beautiful day. lynsea garrison Chapter 2. “The Doctors.” david eisenberg David! David! How many babies today? How many women today? You don’t have to do this. We can find you another job. I’m like, I don’t want another job. This is the job I signed up for. This is the job I trained for. I’m a board-certified OB/GYN with a medical degree and a master’s degree who’s been on this career path to provide abortion care and be a medical director of a Planned Parenthood for a decade.

lynsea garrison This is Dr. David Eisenberg. He’s the head doctor at the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis.

david eisenberg Like, would you tell an astronaut who’d been in training for a decade, you know, you really should be a dermatologist. What? No way.

lynsea garrison Every day, when he goes to work, he passes the protesters. And they’re not always peaceful like Brian. So Dr. Eisenberg invited us to his house one night to talk, away from the clinic, away from his patients, away from all protesters.

erin king Did you want to tell Sabrina and Lynsea anything about yourself? lynsea garrison You know how to laugh?

lynsea garrison We met his wife, Erin, who’s also an OB/GYN.

david eisenberg [TODDLER GIGGLES] You don’t know how to laugh?

lynsea garrison His two toddlers.

erin king Drop it.

lynsea garrison And his dog, Cooper.

[barking]

lynsea garrison After they put their kids to bed, Sabrina and I sat down with them in their backyard.

david eisenberg The most regulated thing is a woman’s uterus. sabrina tavernise And it’s clear it’s a political lightning rod, right? david eisenberg Right. And the people being struck by the lightning are the women who need the care. And it’s really sad. sabrina tavernise Is there a sense that things have gotten worse in Missouri? david eisenberg When you say is there a sense, I can only speak to my own personal opinion. sabrina tavernise For you — I mean, in your mind. david eisenberg It is harder to provide abortion care in Missouri than it was in 2009 when I got here.

lynsea garrison Missouri legislators have dramatically changed the medical world he operates in, and for no apparent medical reasons — at least none that he can see.

david eisenberg Said that if you do five or more abortions in your health care facility, you must be a hospital or a licensed ambulatory surgical center. Why five?

lynsea garrison Up until 2017, the state restricted the number of abortions a clinic could provide a month. The limit was four — four abortions a month.

david eisenberg Not five — four.

lynsea garrison And then, here’s another one. If you’re a patient in Missouri and you want an abortion, you have to first get consent from a doctor, wait 72 hours, and then have that same doctor administer your abortion.

david eisenberg So this past winter, I got sick, had a G.I. bug, you know. I could not leave my house. There were 35 women on the schedule at Planned Parenthood for me to consent that day. Not only could I not consent them, the fact that I couldn’t consent them that day meant that they couldn’t get their abortion later that week or the following week, when I was scheduled to provide care. In February, we had an ice storm, where the week after the ice storm, I saw a 17-year-old girl with her mother who was now too far along to have a pill abortion, which is what she wanted — because during the ice storm the week before, her mom, driving her to the clinic from a hundred miles or more away, got in an accident and slid off the road. Well, the consequence of that was she had to come back the following week or two weeks later, but a long enough interval that she could not get the pill abortion that she wanted. This is a girl who’d never been to the OB/GYN before, had no reason to have a pelvic exam, who was now going to have to have a surgical abortion. And the first time she was going to ever have a pelvic exam was with me at the time of her surgical abortion. You know, I’ve taken care of young girls who are — the youngest girl that I’ve ever taken care of is 9 years old. When that girl found herself in the situation she was in and she needed care, there is only one institution in this region where she could go. And we were able to take care of her. And her specific social circumstances were so challenging that if I had to get her to a hospital in Chicago — which, by the way, is the next closest hospital-based abortion service that I’m aware of — I might as well have told her to go to Mars. So that’s what’s changed, right? I mean, there’s all kinds of things that have changed since I got here in 2009 that have made it harder for women to access the care that they need. sabrina tavernise How do keep track of them? I mean, do you put it on a spreadsheet or something, like Post-it notes? david eisenberg I mean, the fact is I live and breathe it every day. You know, I mean, every week, every month, every year that these things come up — I mean, I’ve lost track of it. That’s true. But you know, this is the reality that I live every day.

lynsea garrison It’s become so complicated for Missourians that women are leaving the state. Many go across the Mississippi River to Illinois, a state that’s recently declared itself the most progressive in the country on abortion.

erin king I really enjoy that about my job and —

lynsea garrison Dr. Eisenberg’s wife is a doctor at a place called Hope Clinic, right over the Illinois state line.

erin king People ask me all the time why I don’t do abortions in Missouri. First of all, it’s because it’s really hard to do abortions in Missouri. You have to follow a lot of rules.

lynsea garrison Her name is Dr. Erin King.

sabrina tavernise Are there patients who are now going to Hope Clinic who would have gotten care in Missouri? erin king Absolutely. Yeah. We have seen more patients say that they would have been seen in Missouri, but were unable to access care. Fortunately, we are available, and fortunately, we are fairly close by. I don’t think that it’s a good answer for patients to have to come see us. It still means a longer time, a longer trip, more time off of work, whatever, more gas money. It’s just harder to access us. There’s no public transportation that comes to us. So I’m sure there are more patients that can’t get to us than can. sabrina tavernise What does it feel like being two doctors doing this in a place where it’s hard to do it? erin king I think I asked you this question on the way home the other day, didn’t I? david eisenberg Yeah. erin king I was driving home, and I was super frustrated about lots of things related to this — related to our state, related to people’s attitudes about abortion, our country, just a lot of things. And I think I said, is any doctor happy in their job? And then I said, no, wait, hold on, let me rephrase that. Is any doctor feeling good about what’s going on, essentially, in gynecology and, like, women’s health care right now? Is anyone happy about this? Can anyone physically say that they enjoy what they’re doing right now? Because I was just so angry. Like, I felt so frustrated that literally, like, everywhere we turn, I just, I can’t — it’s almost like, you get tired. It’s like one more thing, one more bad restriction coming down the pipeline, or one more way that our patients can’t get to us, or whatever. david eisenberg Right. erin king So it’s just, like, so frustrating. And there’s lots of things at anyone’s jobs that are frustrating. But I feel like you add that, or you add the person standing outside yelling at you that you are a horrible person or a horrible doctor or mean to your patients or hurting them in some way, it’s just like, you literally — like, sometimes I just — I’m never going to do this. I promise. But sometimes I just want to like, O.K., fine, later. See you. I’m done.

lynsea garrison So in between juggling their two kids, they’re also juggling an entire region of patients seeking abortions.

erin king I don’t know, whatever restriction —

lynsea garrison You might even say what’s left of abortion access in Missouri and in this region exists in large part because of them. And they pay a price for that, like the time that protesters showed up at their house.

erin king And every once in a while outside of the clinic, when I walk in, protesters will say something pretty close to, if you were to die right now, you are going to hell. And I’m like, is that a threat? Like, am I going to die right now? Is that what you’re saying? It’s every once in a while. And I think, in particular, after having children, we worry a little bit more about their safety.

sabrina tavernise Here’s what else you need to know today. Egyptian lawmakers have approved sweeping changes to the country’s Constitution. They would give its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, unprecedented power and allow him to remain in office until the year 2030. The changes cement Sisi’s authoritarian control over Egypt. His regime has already jailed opponents, censored the media, and shut down websites critical of his government. The Egyptian people must now vote on the constitutional amendments, but a fair election is in doubt, given Sisi’s repeated attempts to suppress the opposition. And —

The studio's Netflix rival will be populated by series and films based on its classic titles.

Disney's forthcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service is going to be a prime hub for remakes, reboots and all manner of familiar IP, at least according to early buzz about its initial film and television slate.

Headed by OTT programming chief Agnes Chu, the as-yet-unnamed service — envisioned as a competitor to Netflix — will be a home for family-friendly fare including Marvel feature films and such TV series as a live-action Star Wars (with multiple variations already in the works, per CEO Bob Iger) and, sources tell THR, a reboot of The Muppets.

Disney acquired The Muppets Studio in 2004 and most recently attempted to revive Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and company on the small screen with a critically panned ABC comedy that was canceled after one season in 2016. A search for a writer for the new take is underway.

Also poised to be part of the TV slate, according to Iger, are reboots of star-maker High School Musical and a series based on Pixar's Monsters, Inc. A TV version of The Mighty Ducks, from the trilogy's original screenwriter, is also considered likely to land on the platform, sources say.

The Disney brand extension is expected to make a heavy push into film with an eye on Disney's robust library of family titles. The Parent Trap (1998), Father of the Bride (1991) and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989) are among the first projects on the table for potential film reboots, sources say.

Still to be determined, however, are the official launch date (sometime in fall 2019) and price point for the service, which is expected to bow domestically before expanding abroad.

Disney declined to comment.

A police officer in Pennsylvania will not be charged after shooting and wounding an unarmed man in the torso in the “honest but mistaken” belief he was using a Taser, the authorities said.

In a letter to the police chief of New Hope, a town about 40 miles northeast of Philadelphia, District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub of Bucks County said the shooting of the man, Brian Riling, “was neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused.”

The officer violated a department rule that a Taser be worn on the opposite hip from a firearm, but he “did not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law,” Mr. Weintraub said in a statement that quoted his letter to the police chief.

The statement refers to a Pennsylvania law that states that a person cannot be charged with a crime “if he makes a mistake as a matter of fact for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.”
Press secretary Sarah Sanders was caught lying several times in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, and now she’s defending herself with more misdirections.

During a string of media appearances following the release of the Mueller report on Thursday, Sanders has faced questions about a claim she made during a May 2017 press briefing that she later admitted was false during testimony to Mueller’s team. In an attempt to justify President Donald Trump’s decision to fire then FBI director James Comey, Sanders told reporters that “countless members of the FBI” had contacted her to say they had lost confidence in Comey, when in fact that wasn’t the case.

On Thursday evening and Friday morning, Sanders repeatedly downplayed that lie as a mere “slip of the tongue.” But as ABC’s George Stephanopoulos pointed out to her in an interview on Friday morning, she used the line about “countless members of the FBI” multiple times in the days following Comey’s firing — a revelation undercutting her claim that she merely misspoke.

“You said it was a ‘slip of the tongue’ when you talked about ‘countless FBI members,’ yet you repeated it twice the very next day,” Stephanopoulos said. “That’s not a slip of the tongue, Sarah, that’s a deliberate false statement.”

Sanders, however, refused to own it, and bizarrely blamed her lie on Democrats.

“I’m sorry I wasn’t a robot like the Democratic Party that went out for two-and-a-half years and stated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign, that they had evidence to show it, and that the president and his team deserved to be in jail,” she said. “That he shouldn’t be in office, when really they were the ones that were creating the greatest scandal in the history of our country.”

Pressed repeatedly on her comments on FBI agents, Sarah Sanders tells @GStephanopoulos, "It was the heat of the moment, meaning that it wasn't a scripted talking point. I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democratic Party" was about Mueller probe. https://t.co/mOQZNKl1wy pic.twitter.com/y3xcNwVYHg — ABC News (@ABC) April 19, 2019

The idea behind Sanders’s lie was to provide a rationale for Comey’s firing that had nothing to do with President Donald Trump’s frustrations about the Russia investigation, and thereby allowed him to deny he was trying to obstruct the FBI’s active investigation of his campaign.

Even at the time, Sanders’s claim was implausible. It was almost immediately contradicted during congressional testimony by Comey’s successor, Andrew McCabe, and reporters made it clear during a press briefing following McCabe’s testimony that they didn’t buy what she was telling them.

Mueller's report said Sarah Huckabee Sanders told investigators she made comments to reporters that were "not founded on anything." Here's that moment pic.twitter.com/cqrnTqKDLa — POLITICO (@politico) April 18, 2019

When it came time for Sanders to offer testimony to Mueller’s team, she admitted her statement about the FBI rank and file not being fans of Comey actually “was not founded on anything.” But now that she’s no longer under oath, she’s making a tortured attempt to walk it back.

As Stephanopoulos noted during his interview of Sanders on Friday, the “culture of lying” that emerges from the Mueller report goes beyond Sanders: It began with Trump himself.

Mueller’s report indicates that Trump lied about about a range of topics, from Trump Tower Moscow (Trump said he had no business dealings in Russia on the campaign trail even as the Trump Organization pursued a lucrative real estate deal there) to his role in Comey’s firing (Trump asked McGahn to say he never directed him to fire Comey when in fact he had).

Mueller’s team wasn’t afforded the opportunity to interview Trump. So while Sanders may have been compelled into telling the truth for once, Trump still hasn’t been.

Donald Robertson’s latest book is How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius.

Recently, a bartender in Nova Scotia showed me a quote from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius tattooed on his forearm. “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be,” it said, “just be one.”

We live in an age when social media bombards everyone, especially the young, with advice about every aspect of their lives. Stoic philosophy, of which Marcus Aurelius was history’s most famous proponent, taught its followers not to waste time on diversions that don’t actually improve their character.

In recent decades, Stoicism has been experiencing a resurgence in popularity, especially among millennials. There has been a spate of popular self-help books that helped to spread the word. One of the best known is Ryan Holiday and Steven Hanselman’s The Daily Stoic, which introduced a whole new generation to the concept of philosophy, based on the classics, as a way of life. It has fuelled interest among Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. So has endorsement from self-improvement guru Tim Ferriss who describes Stoicism as the “ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments.”

Why should the thoughts of a Roman emperor who died nearly 2,000 years ago seem particularly relevant today, though? What’s driving this rebirth of Stoicism?

It is likely that what we are witnessing is not a fad but an enduring movement. Stoicism offers rational solutions to human problems but it is especially effective in troubled times. Its offer is attractive: It doesn’t matter how crazy the world is, how “bad” others are, you can always keep your cool and flourish. Such a promise is always enticing to be sure, but it becomes a lifeline in a world that is confusing.

There are local meetups for people interested in Stoicism popping up everywhere. The Stoic Fellowship maintains details of about 50 such groups around the world, including ones in Winnipeg, Halifax, Calgary and Vancouver. However, the largest in the world by far is the Stoicism Toronto meetup, which currently boasts more than 1,000 members.

People are looking for answers on how to live a good life and are turning to philosophy to find them. There is something about the Stoic philosophy that resonates with Canadians. Maybe it’s just the cold winters but there is a palpable hunger here for deep and meaningful conversations.

So what do Stoics believe? One of the most famous practical doctrines of Stoicism is the idea that we have to carefully distinguish between things that are under our control and things that are not. We should learn to take more responsibility for things we do and to be less disturbed by events that happen to us. The basic notion has been neatly captured in the Serenity Prayer, popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous, which says “God give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”

Another famous Stoic teaching is that it’s not things that upset us but rather our judgments about them. That idea became the basis of modern cognitive therapy, which teaches us to become more aware of the role our thinking, or cognition, can play in shaping our emotions.

However, cognitive therapy is remedial – it’s a treatment for specific problems from which someone is already suffering. It arrives late on the scene. The Holy Grail of mental health is prevention because as we all know prevention is better than cure. Stoicism holds out the promise of building what psychologists call long-term emotional resilience. It goes beyond therapy or self-help. Ordinary people can identify with it as a philosophy of life, deeply enough in some cases to get its words of wisdom tattooed on their bodies.

Stoic acceptance does not mean passivity, though. The ancient Stoics sought to reconcile emotional calm with deliberate action for the common welfare of mankind. It’s this service to a higher and more fundamental goal that gives Stoicism’s adherents a sense of purpose and meaning in life.

For instance, former mayor of Vancouver, Sam Sullivan, has brought this aspect of Stoicism into Canadian politics. You might not have heard about his philosophical influences, though, because rather than preaching the Stoic gospel he sought to exemplify it in his own character.

“Stoicism is more about your actions and the way you live,” he says. “It’s not a religion that you could proselytize. I never really talked about philosophy as such.”

However, Mr. Sullivan, whose disability-rights advocacy earned him the Order of Canada in 2005, doesn’t hesitate to credit the Stoics for helping him cope with the challenges he has faced over the years in life and in the political arena.

In 2008, when Mr. Sullivan lost the vote to run for a second term as mayor, he put his setback in perspective by reminding himself that it was trivial compared with the misfortunes faced by others throughout history, such as his hero, the philosopher Socrates. The Stoic wisdom, which says that even though we cannot ultimately control the misfortunes that befall us, we can control how we respond to them, sustained him through tough times.

Story continues below advertisement

Many people today are worried about terrorism, climate change, political corruption and other big issues that can seem both undeniably important and yet far beyond their ability to control as individuals. The real message of Stoicism, for Mr. Sullivan and others, is that we can remain committed to improving the world around us without having to become distressed when things fall short of our expectations.

That’s what we mean when we speak of someone maintaining a “philosophical attitude” in the face of adversity.
Recently designated as a disorder in the DSM-5, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) presents an array of avenues for further research. PMDD's profile, characterized by cognitive–affective symptoms during the premenstruum, is unique from that of other affective disorders in its symptoms and cyclicity. Neurosteroids may be a key contributor to PMDD's clinical presentation and etiology, and represent a potential avenue for drug development. This review will present recent literature on potential contributors to PMDD's pathophysiology, including neurosteroids and stress, and explore potential treatment targets.

Introduction—Developments in Defining PMDD

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe mood disorder, is characterized by cognitive–affective and physical symptoms in the week before menses and affects millions of women worldwide [1, 2]. A significant recent development is the recognition of PMDD as a distinct disorder in the DSM-5 [3]. In 2012, a committee of international experts on the pathophysiology and treatment of PMDD submitted to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-5 Executive Committee a review of the current science regarding PMDD and gave their recommendation for PMDD's inclusion in the DSM-5 as a full diagnostic category [2].

In defining PMDD, mood symptoms are key. Both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 diagnoses are based upon a perimenstrual pattern of at least five physical, affective, and/or behavioral symptoms, with a requirement of at least one of the key affective symptoms of affective lability (mood swings, tearfulness, sensitivity to rejection); irritability or anger that is often characterized by increased interpersonal conflicts; marked depressed mood, hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts; or anxiety, tension or feeling on edge [3]. The woman may also experience difficulty concentrating or a sense of feeling overwhelmed or out of control. These cognitive–affective symptoms can be accompanied by behavioral and somatic symptoms such as loss of interest in usual activities, lack of energy, changes in appetite or food cravings, changes in sleep, and physical symptoms unique to the premenstruum such as breast tenderness, breast swelling or bloating [3]. Per DSM-5 criteria, these symptoms must have occurred during most menstrual cycles in the past year to meet criteria for PMDD diagnosis. Data from community and clinical samples of women with a prospectively confirmed diagnosis of PMDD report the greatest severity of symptoms from 3–4 days prior to onset of menses to up to 3 days post-menses onset [4]. Symptoms must be absent in the post-menstrual week.

While it may seem a minor difference between the DSM-IV and -5, mood lability and irritability are listed first in the latter version due to findings that these symptoms are considerably more common among women with PMDD than depressed mood which had been listed first in the DSM-IV [2, 5]. Another subtle difference between the DSM-IV and -5 criteria is that the latter included the concept of distress in addition to impairment due to PMDD symptoms. Distress and/or impairment must be present in the area of work, school, social activities, or relationships with others.

Of particular importance, the symptoms should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings for at least two symptomatic cycles; this may be accomplished via tools such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems [6], the Calendar of Premenstrual Experiences [7], or the Premenstrual Assessment Form [8]. Although a presumptive diagnosis of PMDD can be made based upon history alone, prospective daily ratings are invaluable in ruling out premenstrual exacerbation of other psychiatric disorders that are present to some extent throughout the menstrual cycle.

Relative to PMDD, a larger proportion of women experience milder premenstrual symptoms. Recently, attempts have been made to distinguish between mild premenstrual symptoms experienced by many women versus the more severe symptoms present in PMDD [2, 9]. Bodies including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the World Health Organization [10, 11] have published descriptions of premenstrual mood changes. While lay language often refers to any unpleasant or undesirable physical, emotional, or behavioral symptom occurring prior to or during menses as premenstrual syndrome or “PMS,” the ACOG provides specific criteria for its diagnosis, including one physical or psychological symptom in the 5 days prior to menses [10]. The symptoms must occur in three consecutive menstrual cycles and must subside within 4 days of menses onset. As in PMDD, the symptom(s) must cause significant impairment and must be verified by prospective rating for diagnosis. Given this continuum of severity, future research may focus on the etiology of symptoms shared between PMDD and PMS. The primary focus of the current article is PMDD, however, some studies cited have included women with severe PMS that may include mood symptoms. If the authors have not distinguished between PMDD or severe PMS, we will herein use the term utilized in their article.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Links between the alleged spies and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi are being investigated

Turkey has arrested what it says are two intelligence operatives who confessed to spying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.

Turkey is investigating whether there may be links to the murder last year of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate, a senior Turkish official told Reuters.

The CIA believes the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing.

Saudi Arabia claims the murder was as a result of "rogue" operatives.

"We are investigating whether the primary individual's arrival in Turkey was related to the Jamal Khashoggi murder," said the official, adding the person had been monitored for six months before the arrests in Istanbul on Monday.

"It is possible that there was an attempt to collect information about Arabs, including political dissidents, living in Turkey."

Turkish officials seized an encrypted computer found in what the official said was the spy ring's base in Istanbul.

The official, who requested anonymity, said statements by the suspected spies suggested their intelligence operation had targeted political exiles and students.

"We have extensive evidence of the individuals' covert activities on Turkish soil," the official said, calling it an "airtight" case.

"They also confessed to have been employed by the UAE's intelligence services."

Saudi Arabia and the UAE have long been close allies, collaborating closely during the 2017-18 Qatar diplomatic crisis.

An embargo against Qatar was introduced by four countries - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates - who accused the gas-rich state of supporting terrorism, a charge it strongly denies.

However, there has been no evidence to suggest the UAE was involved in the murder of Khashoggi.

What's the latest in the Khashoggi case?

Saudi Arabia has put 11 people on trial for the murder and is seeking the death penalty for five of them.

It has refused to extradite its citizens to Turkey after the country issued arrest warrants for several Saudi officials.

A UN preliminary report released in February said Khashoggi "was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the state of Saudi Arabia".

Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor said the Washington Post journalist had been given a lethal injection after a struggle and his body dismembered inside the consulate after his death. He said it was on the orders of a rogue intelligence officer, and not Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Project Sakura Wars Shows Off The Mobile Gadget ‘Smartron’ And More Of The Imperial Combat Revue

By Alistair Wong . April 19, 2019 . 4:00pm

Sega has released another wave of screenshots for Project Sakura Wars that show off some of the things we’ve heard about previously, such as the new steam-operated mobile gadget that is something like a smartphone, ‘Smartron’, and more. The new Imperial Combat Revue have also gotten new screenshots for each character. [Thanks, 4Gamer!]

New Story Details

After the Great Kouma War, where the gallant Imperial Combat Revue fought and won at the price of their disappearance, the concept of Combat Revues was recognized globally thanks to their achievements. Thus, new Combat Revues were installed across the world, and in order to encourage and enhance each other’s strength, the WLOF Combat Revue Federation was established in order to hold competitions between the Revues once every two years.

After 10 years, the Imperial Combat Revue of Tokyo was finally revived, and the new Floral Division are aiming to be the best in the latest World Combat Revue War. However, the Kouma return alongside a mysterious enemy, and the peaceful festival shifts into a fight where the fate of the world is at stake.

The Imperial Capital

It has been 12 years since Sakura Wars V, and Ginza has developed into an even more modern steam-driven city that incorporates both ancient Japanese culture and Western influences.

Smartron

As previously described, this device lets you contact allies, and also acts as Seijuurou’s map around town. You can find other Combat Revue allies across Ginza.

The LIPS system where you need to make choices for responses under a limited time makes a return.

Readout from Acting Secretary McAleenan’s Trip to McAllen WASHINGTON - Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan travelled to McAllen, Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the strategic and operational challenges faced by law enforcement and local communities as they work to confront the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at the U.S. Southern Border.



The Acting Secretary joined the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Tuesday for a midnight shift tour of the U.S.-Mexico border – including key crossing points and staging areas central to human smuggling – in order to assess the strategic and operational challenges faced by law enforcement operations in the region. McAleenan expressed appreciation for agents’ unwavering dedication in the face of record migration flows and emphasized the necessity of remaining steadfast in executing DHS’ mission.



Currently, DHS facilities along the Southwest Border are at peak capacity, while officers and agents lack the resources to adequately administer humanitarian services to migrants.



On Wednesday, Acting Secretary McAleenan toured the Humanitarian Respite Center operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley (CCRGV), a local nongovernmental organization providing services to migrants once they are released from custody, followed by meetings with the members of the Center’s leadership. There, McAleenan discussed CCRGV’s needs related to the care of migrants in the area and expressed appreciation for the organization’s continued dedication to the vulnerable and migrant populations. McAleenan then hosted a roundtable with local mayors, stressing the need to work together to achieve security at the border while providing critical services to migrants.



“We recognize the strain that this humanitarian crisis has placed on service providers and communities such as yours along the border – it affects the men and women of DHS as well,” McAleenan emphasized. “We hope to better coordinate our efforts to manage the migrants in our care. But we are also working to address the factors driving this crisis.”



Throughout his trip, McAleenan reiterated that the border security emergency and humanitarian crisis are inextricably linked. In an address to the media, McAleenan explained that drug smugglers and human traffickers are using the humanitarian crisis as cover while DHS resources are diverted to medical care and other humanitarian duties associated with managing large groups of families.



The Acting Secretary also acknowledged the need for more resources to manage flows of families and provide care to children.



“We are taking aggressive action to mitigate the crisis, and protect vulnerable people in our custody by expanding medical care, creating temporary facilities, improving transportation, using additional resources from across DHS while seeking continued support from interagency partners throughout the Federal government,” he said.



The Acting Secretary called on Congress to enact legislation that will offer long-lasting solutions to the border crisis. “We are imploring Congress to provide the resources we need for enhancing our humanitarian and border security efforts, and, most importantly, to work with us on targeted solutions to restore integrity to our immigration system and remove the incentives for families and children to cross our border illegally.” Specifically, he requested legislative fixes that would allow DHS to hold families together in custody, treat all children equally by allowing the U.S. to return Central American children to their home countries, eliminate asylum fraud, and protect vulnerable populations by allowing individuals to apply for asylum from their home countries rather than taking the dangerous trek north.



DHS and its federal law enforcement partners are doing everything to confront the worsening security and humanitarian crisis. DHS has taken a full-fledged “disaster response,” including appointing a lead federal official for interagency action and leveraging the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC). DHS agencies “surged” resources and personnel from across the Department toward border security and migration management, including immediately redeploying hundreds of CBP personnel from field operations and ports of entry to assist with the response to the crisis. By reassigning these personnel, USBP agents will be freed up from humanitarian response and enabled to return to critical security operations.

GUANGZHOU, CHINA—Xinhua reports that a 13,500-year-old tomb at the site of the Qingtang ruins in southeastern China has yielded the remains of a young woman who died between the ages of 13 and 18 and was buried, without her head, in a squatting position. Liu Suoqiang of the Guangdong Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology said the woman was deliberately put in a squatting posture. “It points to the emergence of the concepts of life and death and of primitive religious beliefs,” Liu explained. Researchers are also trying to determine whether the woman’s head was missing due to natural causes, or whether it was removed. Burials containing remains arranged in a squatting posture have been found in other prehistoric tombs in southern China and Southeast Asia, though the symbolism of the posture is unclear. A bone pin was also found in the young woman's grave. For more on archaeology in China, go to “Early Signs of Empire.”
Although Mauro Ranallo is widely acclaimed by fans of sports entertainment for his emphatic play-by-play commentary on NXT programming, he was penalized today with a 30-day suspension for “repeatedly and brazenly” giving on-air shout outs to his mother, Mia Ranallo.

This past week alone, Ranallo hollered “Mamma Mia” 13 times during a single hour-long broadcast, prompting backstage brass to take action.

More from Kayfabe News

“While some on-air acknowledgement of family is fine — such as Michael Cole occasionally mentioning his son, Adam — Mr. Ranallo’s repeated matriarchal exclamations have become too much,” reads a statement issued by an NXT spokesperson identified only as W. Regal.

Ranallo, who is known for his unbridled enthusiasm and thesaurus-like vocabulary, said the suspension is “a loathsome, odious abomination that shall be assiduously and punctiliously countermanded by my indefatigable barrister, forthwith.”

After a moment’s pause for introspection, Ranallo added: “Mamma Mia!”
The Department of Housing and Urban Development announced this week that it is issuing new rules for down payment assistance on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration.

The FHA currently requires borrowers to provide a minimum down payment (or Minimum Required Investment, referred to by HUD as MRI) of 3.5% of the home’s purchase price. FHA rules allow family members, employers, and “governmental entities” to contribute to a borrower’s minimum down payment.

And “governmental entities” are apparently the issue at hand.

According to HUD, the FHA will now require certain additional documentation for borrowers who are using funds from another person or entity to “satisfy any portion of the MRI,” including specific documentation for when a “governmental entity provides down payment assistance to qualified borrowers within the governmental entity’s jurisdiction.”

The new rules are laid out in an FHA mortgagee letter titled “Downpayment Assistance and Operating in a Governmental Capacity.”

According to HUD, this “clarification” of the current documentation rules “should assist mortgagees in determining whether governmental entities providing gifts or secondary financing, or both, towards borrowers’ MRI are doing so consistent with FHA requirements.”

As the FHA states in its mortgagee letter, the current FHA handbook requires mortgagees to confirm that a “governmental entity is operating in its governmental capacity but, except for requiring a source of funds letter, does not specify the necessary documentation that demonstrates support for such a conclusion.”

According to HUD, that lack of “necessary documentation” is leading to some unnamed “entities” skirting the rules.

“It has come to FHA’s attention that certain Governmental Entities may be acting beyond the scope of any inherent or granted governmental authority in providing funds towards the Borrower’s MRI in circumstances that would violate Handbook 4000.1, the National Housing Act, and is contrary to established law,” the FHA said in the mortgagee letter.

In order to remedy this situation, the FHA is now stating that its current documentation requirements need to be “clarified to provide Mortgagees with specific guidance regarding documentation that will give greater assurances that the standards for providing the MRI have been satisfied by the Governmental Entity.”

According to HUD and the FHA, the new rules took effect on April 18, 2019.

A bitcoin investor couple are on the run and facing potential death sentences after Thai authorities alleged their life on the open seas was a threat to national sovereignty.

Key points: Seasteading promotes living in international waters to be free of any nation's laws

Thailand's navy claims the couple endangered national sovereignty, an offence punishable by death

The couple went on the run before the authorities raided their floating home

United States citizen Chad Andrew Elwartowski and Thai national Supranee Thepdet, who goes by the English name Nadia Summergirl, had been living part-time in a small structure anchored outside Thailand's territorial waters, about 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres) from Phuket's shore.

But the couple fled ahead of Thai authorities raiding their floating platform home in the Andaman Sea, where the couple sought to pioneer the "seasteading" movement.

Seasteading promotes living in international waters to be free of any nation's laws.

The "seavangelists" believe floating nations will "restore the environment, enrich the poor, cure the sick, and liberate humanity from politicians".

But Thailand's navy claims the couple endangered national sovereignty, an offence punishable by life imprisonment or death.

The police complaint alleged the couple breached section 119 of the Thai criminal code, which refers to the intent to impact the sovereignty or deteriorate the independence of the state.

"The complaint has been filed against them for breaching Section 119 of the Criminal Code as there is evidence showing that they have publicly invited people on social media to stay at the site, which is adjacent to our territorial waters … we have laws to deal with this. It affects our sovereignty," said the Third Naval Area commander, according to the Bangkok Post.

"This is ridiculous. We lived on a floating house boat for a few weeks and now Thailand wants us killed," Mr Elwartowski wrote on Facebook.

Ocean Builders, which is connected to the seasteading movement, said in a statement that "Chad and Nadia are safe for now but understand that Thailand is currently being run by a military dictator".

The statement claimed a fair trial for the duo was unlikely.

"We hope this issue can be resolved diplomatically with the Thai government and are ready to talk to anyone in charge at any time," Ocean Builders said.

"We have tried several times to talk to anyone but were always told that we have nothing to worry about because we are legally in international waters."

Mr Elwartowski and Ocean Builders said the couple were not involved in the building or construction of the sea home.

Videos posted to YouTube show the couple being involved in erecting a spar in the ocean and towing the platform home out to sea.

Mr Elwartowski told Reason magazine earlier this year that "the team surrounding the project were early adopters of bitcoin", and had spent some $150,000 on the project.

According to the BBC, he reportedly worked as a software engineer for the US military before investing in the cryptocurrency.

The Thai navy was set to dismantle and sink the structure, according to the Bangkok Post, but Ocean Builders said a signal picked up from the platform indicated it still stood.

Ocean Builders wrote in a statement that GPS signals "independently" showed the structure fell outside Thailand's Contiguous Zone (but outside its territorial waters); however, the ABC has been unable to independently verify its precise location.

"Whether it is still there or not does not matter much to me," Mr Elwartowski said in a separate Facebook post.

"I'm more concerned about Nadia being driven from her home country and her family. Her son is worried. I hope they can be reunited some day soon.

"The person(s) who funded the seastead are concerned about losing the seastead but Nadia and I were just tenants."

Holy hot sauce, batman!

My Santa sent FIVE different hot sauces. I can't wait to try them all.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday became the first 2020 presidential candidate to explicitly say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, citing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings.

“The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help,” Warren tweeted on Friday afternoon. “Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.”

She then cited text from the special counsel’s redacted report, released Thursday: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.”

“The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment,” the senator declared.

“The severity of [Trump’s] misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,” the Massachusetts Democrat concluded. “That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.”

Most recently, Warren said she wanted to wait until the Mueller report was released before making a conclusion on impeachment—a line that many 2020 Democrats have taken thus far. Now she is one of two who definitively said that the contents of the report warrant the initiation of impeachment proceedings.

Other competitors in the primary field have been more cautious in recent days deferring to Congress on the matter, though in an interview with CNN on Friday, Julián Castro was more direct saying that it would be "perfectly reasonable" for the House to begin impeachment proceedings. Castro's campaign characterized it as him being first to the punch on the issue.

“I think that Congress needs to make that decision,” South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said at an event on Friday. “I think he may well deserve it, but my focus, since I’m not a part of Congress but I am part of 2020, is to give him a decisive defeat at the ballot box, if he is the Republican nominee in 2020.”

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) told MSNBC that she wouldn’t rule it out but would like to hear testimony from Mueller.

“I think that there is definitely a conversation to be had on that subject, but first I want to hear from Bob Mueller,” Harris told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes in an interview on Thursday, “and really understand what exactly is the evidence that supports the summary that we have been given today.”

Others, like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), have only said that Congress should continue investigating the president.

“It is clear that Donald Trump wanted nothing more than to shut down the Mueller investigation,” he said on Thursday following the report’s release. “While we have more detail from today’s report than before, Congress must continue its investigation into Trump’s conduct and any foreign attempts to influence our election. We must also work to do everything we can to protect our future elections from the significant threat of foreign interference, and I call on President Trump and Republican leadership to stop obstructing the necessary work to protect our democracy.”

Last week in Chicago, fans got their first look at the Disney+ live-action Star Wars series, The Mandalorian. And while most of The Mandalorian's new footage was shown behind closed doors, IGN was on the ground at Star Wars Celebration to get the details firsthand. Series creator and executive producer Jon Favreau announced that the highly-anticipated series will premiere when the streaming service launches on November 12, 2019.

The other big reveal from Celebration was that The Mandalorian will likely release its episodes weekly, instead of utilizing Netflix's "binge it all at once" method. Hulu also uses a week-to-week schedule for many of its prominent titles like The Handmaid's Tale and Castle Rock. But in this new "binging age" of Stranger Things and Amazon's The Man in the High Castle, is Disney+ hurting itself by opting for a more traditional way of consuming entertainment? We have some thoughts on Disney's approach to streaming.

The Game of Thrones Effect

In its eighth and final season, Game of Thrones earned a record-breaking 17.4 million viewers for the premiere. GoT does TV the "old way," releasing one new episode per week. Sure, you could wait for Season 8 to conclude and binge away, but with the added risk of spoilers permeating the internet... Who wants to take that chance? The HBO fantasy series has proven that if you create something people love, they'll stick around and wait for the next entry in the series - even if it's a whole week away.

Exit Theatre Mode

HBO has wisely invested in streaming options with its respective GO and NOW digital platforms, along with add-ons via Hulu and Amazon Prime, which make it easy to stream Game of Thrones even without a cable subscription. So you can try a trial month, binge your favorite shows when the full season is available, and then cancel if you want to. Disney is adopting a similar system with an even lower price point than HBO - $6.99 per month or $69.99 for the entire year. But how will Disney+ keep its subscribers around while they wait for more episodes to drop?

Disney's Massive Library

Disney has been a household name for nearly a century, boasting numerous beloved live-action and animated films. And with its acquisitions of Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and Fox, Disney is now an entertainment juggernaut. Sure, Netflix is making a name for itself, spending over $13 billion in 2018 on original content, and earning more Emmy nominations than any other network. However, Netflix doesn't have that decades-deep digital library that Disney does - and still relies on a lot of acquired content to draw viewers as it attempts to grow its slate of Originals. At launch, most of the Disney motion picture library will be available, even those coveted "vault classics" that only become available on home entertainment once in a blue moon. And with all of the Fox properties at its deposal, Disney+ will also be the only place you can stream all 30+ seasons of The Simpsons... Not a bad deal for $7. Check out all the shows and movies we know are coming to Disney+ so far in the gallery below.

When episode 1 of The Mandalorian drops on November 12, there will clearly be plenty of Disney and Fox titles for you to consume while you wait for episode 2, including most of the Star Wars movies and many entries from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's safe to assume that Disney+ is offering such a good deal at launch to entice new subscribers to join, but how long that price will last is anyone's guess. Netflix raises its prices at least once a year to offset the rising cost of acquiring new content.

The Digital Wild West

The digital streaming landscape has never been more competitive than in 2019, and some of the big players haven't entered the ring yet. WarnerMedia is one of those competitors that has a large footprint in the entertainment world, with networks like CNN, HBO, and The CW in its arsenal. The media conglomerate also owns Friends, which Netflix recently paid $100 million just to license for another year. When WarnerMedia finally launches its new service, the popular sitcom will likely become an exclusive offering on that streaming service. And like Disney+, Warner also has a rich history, with shows like Scooby Doo, Bugs Bunny, Supernatural, and The Flash.

Apple is also preparing to join the streaming wars with its creatively titled Apple TV+, also launching this fall in an attempt to compete with Disney+, although the tech giant has yet to reveal its own price point or show release strategy. While Apple doesn't boast the power of existing franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, it's investing heavily in recognizable Hollywood heavy-hitters like J.J. Abrams, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey to carve out its own niche in the crowded TV landscape. Take a look at the shows in development for Apple TV+ in the slideshow below.

In the end, it's really too early to say which version of streaming is the best, or will prove the most successful long term. So far, Netflix's binge model is popular and shifting the way many viewers consume media, but shows like Game of Thrones, The Handmaid's Tale, and (despite shedding viewers in recent years) AMC's The Walking Dead have shown that the traditional weekly episode release schedule is still viable - and in some ways preferable, in terms of creating a cultural conversation that lasts longer than a weekend. Disney+ will have a rich heritage and massive digital library, but going forward, if it wants to compete with the likes of Netflix and WarnerMedia, it's going to need to create quality content to keep viewers coming back for more, which will matter far more than the way episodes are released. There's only so many times you can watch Frozen before "Let it Go" gets old.

In the hours after the public release of the redacted report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller, President Donald Trump took to Twitter with a message that reads, in part, “NO OBSTRUCTION!”

That’s not at all what the Mueller report says, though.

“Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,” Mueller wrote. “The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.”

Mueller, however, refrained from recommending prosecution, saying that there were “difficult [legal] issues that would need to be resolved,” in order to reach a conclusion that the crime of obstruction of justice was committed by Trump.

Factoring into his decision not to weigh in on prosecution, Mueller wrote, was an opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel finding that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions” in violation of “the constitutional separation of powers.”

“Because we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President’s conduct,” Mueller wrote.

Mueller emphasized, however, that his analysis of the evidence did not clear the president of obstruction. Said Mueller: “[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.”

Mueller noted several complicating factors with respect to determining whether illegal obstruction occurred. For starters, he wrote, “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.” Or, as Trump has repeatedly reminded, the report found “NO COLLUSION” by anyone in the Trump campaign with Russians trying to sway the 2016 election in his favor. But that doesn’t preclude the possibility of obstruction, Mueller said. According to the report, “the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events-such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’s release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.”

Nor does the fact that many of the president’s acts occurred in public view — “including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons” — necessarily clear him, the report states.

Mueller report: While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a corrupt intent, the President’s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system’s integrity is equally threatened.

Mueller noted that it was only the refusal of Trump’s underlings to go along with his efforts to tamper that kept Trump from being able to successfully impede the investigation.

Mueller report: The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. [Former FBI Director James] Comey did not end the investigation of [Retired Lt. Gen. Michael] Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. [White House counsel Don] McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s order. [Former campaign manager Corey] Lewandowski and [Trump campaign official Rick] Dearborn did not deliver the President’s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.

In a press conference just prior to the public release of the redacted Mueller report on April 18, Attorney General William P. Barr said that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “disagreed with some of [Mueller’s] legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law.” But he said that based on the evidence and legal framework presented by Mueller, they concluded the investigation did not establish that Trump had committed the criminal offense of obstruction of justice.

During his press conference, Barr claimed that “the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims.”

That’s contradicted in the report. Mueller notes that after Trump learned that his own conduct regarding obstruction was being investigated after appointment of the special counsel, “the President engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.”

The president was also less than fully cooperative regarding Mueller’s interview requests, the report states.

The special counsel’s office sought an interview with the president for “more than a year,” getting written responses in late November 2018. “[O]n more than 30 occasions” Trump said he “does not ‘recall’ or ‘remember’ or have an ‘independent recollection’” in response to questions, while other answers were “incomplete or imprecise,” the Mueller report says.

The special counsel’s office told the president’s counsel that the written format was inadequate and didn’t give investigators an “opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client’s recollection.” But the president declined another request for an in-person interview.

Mueller’s team considered a subpoena, but they were concerned with the delay that would cause. Plus, “at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.”

In any case, Barr’s decision not to pursue charges of obstruction against the president may not be the final word.

Mueller left open the door for congressional consideration of Trump’s conduct. “With respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,” Mueller wrote.

In considering whether the president may have committed obstruction of justice, Mueller examined 11 “key events,” which we will summarize below. The report notes that prosecutors need to establish “three basic elements” for an obstruction charge: “an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent.”

Trump campaign’s response to reports about Russian support

Over the course of the campaign, Trump and his advisors made public statements distancing the candidate from his apparent ties to Russia. Internally, though, the discussions were different.

The report lays out months of press coverage of potential Russian ties to the Trump campaign and puts it next to the campaign’s responses to that coverage as it was happening. It also includes information uncovered through the special counsel’s investigation revealing how those issues had been discussed within the Trump camp.

Two issues emerge: the potential knowledge of WikiLeaks’ release of hacked emails and the Trump Organization’s plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

WikiLeaks posted emails on July 22, 2016, that had been hacked from the Democratic National Committee. Trump, at the time, dismissed as “crazy” the suggestion that those emails had been hacked by Russia in an effort to help his campaign. At a press conference on July 27, 2016, Trump said of the suggestion, “It is so far fetched, it’s ridiculous. Honestly, I wish I had that power. I’d love to have that power.”

A heavily redacted section of the report cites testimony given by Rick Gates — the deputy campaign manager who was swept up in the Russia probe and pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to investigators — saying that shortly after the Wikileaks release, he was in the car on the way to an airport with Trump when Trump took a call. After he got off the phone, the report says, “Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.”

Roger Stone, an informal Trump adviser, communicated with members of the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks’ planned releases, according to his Jan. 24, 2019, indictment.

In the summer of 2016, the report says, the Trump campaign planned “a communications strategy based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks.”

At the same press conference where Trump called Russian help for his campaign “far fetched,” he also repeated the phrase “I have nothing to do with Russia” several times, the report noted.

However, the Trump Organization had been pursuing a project to build Trump Tower Moscow from September 2015 to June 2016 and Trump got regular updates on its progress, the special counsel found. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, told investigators that, around this time, campaign advisers had developed a “party line” that Trump had no business with, or connections to, Russia.

President’s conduct concerning the investigation of Michael Flynn

The special counsel’s office also weighed whether Trump’s behavior regarding the FBI’s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn amounted to evidence of obstruction. Flynn in late 2017 pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about conversations he had with a Russian ambassador during the transition regarding U.S. sanctions leveled by the Obama administration.

In particular, the report probes Trump’s interactions with former FBI Director James Comey — many of which have been publicly reported before — and corroborates some key details.

After learning about the FBI’s questioning of Flynn, according to the report, Trump invited Comey to a private dinner meeting on Jan. 27, 2017 — the one in which Comey says Trump asked for his “loyalty.” The special counsel’s office, citing the President’s Daily Diary, disputed Trump’s previous public statement saying he thought Comey “asked for the dinner” because “he wanted to stay on” as FBI director. “[S]ubstantial evidence corroborates Comey’s account of the dinner invitation and the request for loyalty,” the report states.



Likewise, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed that Trump in February 2017 asked the attendees of a homeland security briefing to leave the Oval Office so he could speak with Comey alone. Comey has testified that Trump brought up Flynn, who had resigned a day earlier, saying: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”

Assessing that episode, the special counsel’s office wrote that “the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Comey to ‘let[] Flynn go’—a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”

Days after that meeting, the report outlines, Trump reportedly asked that his deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, “draft an internal email that would confirm that the President did not direct Flynn to call the Russian Ambassador about sanctions.” McFarland, not knowing if that was true, consulted with a White House attorney who advised against doing so — fearing, in part, that it could look like “a quid pro quo” for an expected ambassadorial appointment. The report said the request was “sufficiently irregular” but that the evidence “does not establish that the President was trying to have McFarland lie.”

The report also says that, despite some conflicting information, the investigation “did not produce evidence that established that the President knew about Flynn’s discussions of sanctions” with the ambassador at the time.

“Evidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI’s broader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told [New Jersey Gov. Chris] Christie, that terminating Flynn would end ‘the whole Russia thing,’” the report states. It also notes: “Multiple witnesses recalled that the President viewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election.”

Trump’s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation

The third area of possible obstruction that Mueller investigated is President Trump’s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation in March and April 2017. This includes Trump’s efforts to prevent and then reverse then-Attorney General Jeff Session’s decision to recuse himself on issues related to the Russia investigation, as well as multiple attempts by the president to convince officials to make statements to the public clarifying that the FBI was not personally investigating him.

Regarding Sessions, the report explains that on March 2, the president called White House counsel Don McGahn and asked him to tell the attorney general not to recuse himself. Sessions, who had been part of Trump’s campaign, nevertheless thought the decision was clear-cut, and he announced his recusal that afternoon.

The following day, a Friday, Trump summoned McGahn to the Oval Office and again brought up Sessions’ recusal. White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was also present, and according to the special counsel’s report, “Bannon recalled that the President was as mad as Bannon had ever seen him and that he screamed at McGahn about how weak Sessions was.”

Over the weekend, Sessions then flew to Mar-a-Lago. There, Sessions recalled Trump pulling him aside to speak to him privately and suggesting that Sessions “unrecuse” himself.

Without coming to definitive conclusions, the Mueller report notes that Trump “attempted to prevent Sessions’s recusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules.” Similarly, the report states that following the recusal, “the White House Counsel’s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions about the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The President continued to raise the issue of Sessions’s recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he pulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse.”

The remainder of the obstruction concern deals with the president’s actions following then-FBI Director James Comey’s congressional testimony on March 20, which made public for the first time the fact that the FBI was investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and looking into possible links between members of the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Under direction from Dana Boente, the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation, Comey declined to answer whether President Trump was under investigation. This led to press reports suggesting that Trump was being investigated.

After Comey’s testimony, the president proceeded to ask multiple intelligence leaders, including Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers to refute the news stories and make a public statement clarifying that Trump was not connected to Russian interference in the election. All refused.

In Rogers’ case, the ask was concerning enough that Deputy NSA Director Richard Ledgett, who had been on the call with Rogers, wrote up a memorandum documenting the content of the call, which was then placed in a safe. According to the report, Ledgett also “said it was the most unusual thing he had experienced in 40 years of government service.” Rogers, however, told investigators that he did not interpret the request as an order to interfere with the investigation.

Finally, Trump called Comey on March 30, and according to Comey’s notes, which were taken at the time, the president said “he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.” Trump asked Comey what could be done to “lift the cloud.” Trump later called Comey again on April 11 to follow up. Both calls were made, Trump would later acknowledge, against McGahn’s advice.

The special counsel’s report concludes that the evidence “does not establish that the President asked or directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI’s Russia investigation.”

“But the President’s intent in trying to prevent Sessions’s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey following Comey’s public announcement of the FBI’s Russia investigation,” the report reads, “is nevertheless relevant to understanding what motivated the President’s other actions towards the investigation.”

The firing of FBI Director James Comey

Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017.

Before Comey’s May 3, 2017, testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Trump had said “it would be the last straw if Comey did not take the opportunity to set the record straight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation,” the Mueller report says, citing then-White House counsel McGahn.

Comey didn’t do that. Later that day, according to notes taken by Jody Hunt, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff, Trump told Sessions: “This is terrible Jeff. It’s all because you recused. … You left me on an island. I can’t do anything.” Hunt said Sessions suggested Trump think about removing Comey.

At a May 5, 2017, dinner, Trump told advisers and family members he wanted to fire Comey. At a May 8 meeting between the president and White House officials, according to Hunt’s notes, the group discussed a letter and recommendation written by Sessions and Rosenstein on Comey’s removal. And the next day, May 9, the president agreed that letter and memo from Rosenstein, citing Comey’s actions in the probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails, should be the basis for a termination letter to Comey, McGahn recalled. But Trump insisted that the letter include language saying Comey had told him three times that he was not under investigation. Comey was fired that day.

On May 10, according to news reports and not disputed by the White House, Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office: “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia.”

Publicly, the White House press office said it was Rosenstein’s idea to fire Comey. But in a May 11, 2017, interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, Trump said that he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he decided to fire Comey. The president said he would have fired Comey with or without Rosenstein’s recommendation.

In analyzing this incident, the Mueller report says that removing Comey would be an obstructive act if it interfered with or impeded the investigation. While this could affect the way a successor conducted the investigation, Trump appointed Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe interim director, and McCabe had told the president that he worked “very closely” with Comey.

As for the president’s intent, the Mueller report says “[s]ubstantial evidence indicates” that Comey’s unwillingness, despite Trump’s requests, to say publicly that Trump wasn’t under investigation prompted Trump to fire him.

Why was this important to the president? The Mueller report says there’s some evidence Trump felt the investigation was hurting his ability to get things done, particularly with Russia. Trump also may have felt Comey was insubordinate.

“Other evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign,” the report says, citing Trump asking Comey for “loyalty” and Trump saying he should be able to tell the attorney general “who to investigate.”

The president “had a motive to put the FBI’s Russia investigation behind him,” the report says, saying that “the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.” The report cites Trump’s public statements during the campaign that he had no connections to Russia, even while he was briefed on progress of a Trump Tower Moscow. Some “witnesses” also said “that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks releases” and that Trump was aware of something, which is redacted, “at a time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the hacks.”

Trump’s efforts to remove the special counsel

Rosenstein appointed Mueller the special counsel to oversee the Russia inquiry on May 17, 2017.

Trump’s reaction to the appointment, according to the report, was to say, “This is the end of my Presidency.” He also became angry with Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Trump asked Sessions, “How could you let this happen, Jeff,” and then told Sessions he should resign.

Days later, Trump began to tell his White House advisers that Mueller couldn’t serve as special counsel because of conflicts of interest. Specifically, the report says, Trump said Mueller had interviewed to become FBI director prior to being named special counsel, that he had been employed by a law firm that had represented people connected to Trump, and that Mueller had disputed membership fees that he was charged by a Trump golf course in Virginia. But Trump advisers told him that those did not count as conflicts, and the Justice Department also said that Mueller’s previous legal work would not prevent him from acting as special counsel. Trump, the report indicates, still directed McGahn to talk to Rosenstein about the issue, which McGhan declined to do. McGahn told Trump he should discuss it with his personal lawyer, but that it would look as though he was “still trying to meddle in [the] investigation” and “knocking out Mueller” would be “[a]nother fact used to claim obst[ruction] of just[ice.]”

Then, on June 14, 2017, the Washington Post reported that the special counsel was, in fact, investigating whether Trump had attempted to obstruct justice by firing Comey. Trump responded to the news report by criticizing the investigation in a series of tweets over the next two days. Trump then called McGhan twice on June 17, 2017, and ordered him to call Rosenstein and have Mueller removed as special counsel based on the conflicts that Trump believed existed. “Mueller has to go” and “Call me back when you do it,” McGahn recalled Trump telling him on the second call, the report says. McGahn said he had no intention of relaying the president’s message to Rosenstein, and instead decided that he would resign if the president persisted.

Trump also consulted Christie about having Mueller fired, and Christie, the report says, advised him against it.

Regarding the president’s intent, the report says there is evidence the president was aware that he should not have given McGhan those instructions.

“The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the President that the White House Counsel’s Office — and McGahn himself — could not be involved in pressing conflict claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he wished to raise conflicts,” the report says. “Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, the President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media reported on the President’s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story. … Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the President’s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.”

Efforts to curtail the special counsel’s investigation

In the summer of 2017 the president sought the help of Corey Lewandowski — his original campaign manager whom White House officials quoted in the report described as a “devotee” — to limit the scope of the Russia investigation.

In an Oval Office meeting on June 19, 2017, two days after Trump had tried to have the special counsel removed, the president dictated a message that he wanted Lewandowski to take to Sessions. The message was actually the outline of a speech that Trump wanted Sessions to give. According to Lewandowski’s notes quoted in the report, it went like this:

I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS . .. is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history. Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.

If that message had made it to Sessions and been accepted by him, it could have limited the scope of the investigation to only foreign interference on future elections, rather than the one that was being investigated.

But it didn’t get to Sessions. Lewandowski told investigators that he didn’t want to deliver the message over the phone and didn’t want to meet at the Justice Department — it was “Sessions’s turf,” according to the report — and scheduling conflicts kept them apart. So, for a month, the message stayed in a safe at Lewandowski’s home, he told investigators.

On July 19, 2017, Trump and Lewandowski met again in the Oval Office, and Lewandowski told the president his message would be delivered soon. Lewandowski had asked Rick Dearborn, a senior White House official who had a relationship with Sessions, to deliver the message. The pair ran into each other outside of the Oval Office following that meeting, and Lewandowski passed along a typewritten version of the message.

Dearborn “did not recall” whether or not Lewandowski said the message was from the president, according to the report. “The message ‘definitely raised an eyebrow’ for Dearborn, and he recalled not wanting to ask where it came from or think further about doing anything with it,” the report said.

Dearborn told investigators that he told Lewandowski he’d handled the situation, but he never actually gave the message to Sessions.

Later on the same day, Trump gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.

By July 22, 2017, the president had shifted focus to getting Sessions to resign and, while on Marine One, asked for help from his chief of staff, Reince Priebus.

“Priebus believed that the President’s request was a problem, so he called McGahn and asked for advice, explaining that he did not want to pull the trigger on something that was ‘all wrong,’” according to the report. McGahn told Priebus not to follow the president’s order and, instead, consult his own lawyer.

The special counsel’s analysis of this evidence concluded that the president sought to limit the special counsel’s review to only future elections after he had learned that his own conduct was part of the investigation.

Efforts to prevent public disclosure of Trump Tower meeting

The Mueller report provides a detailed analysis of Trump’s efforts to mislead the public or evade public disclosure about the now-infamous June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. According to the report, Trump repeatedly directed his communications staff not to publicly disclose information about the meeting, and he rejected a proposed public statement from Trump Jr. that acknowledged the meeting was with “an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.”

Hope Hicks, a White House communications official, told investigators she read the emails on June 28, 2017, and “recalled being shocked by the emails because they looked ‘really bad.'” In a meeting with Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and the president the next day, Hicks suggested they “get in front of the story” by having Trump Jr. release the emails as part of an interview with “softball questions.” The president insisted he did not want to know details about the emails, and recommended they not go to the press.

On July 8, Hicks said she brought to the president a draft statement about the meeting to be released by Trump Jr. Hicks told investigators that she wanted to disclose the entire story, but that Trump told her to “say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption.” The president’s personal counsel later “repeatedly and inaccurately denied that the President played any role in drafting Trump Jr.’s statement.”

Still, the president’s efforts merely withheld information from the press, the report states, and there is no evidence that Trump “took steps to prevent the emails or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special Counsel” — which would be required to amount to criminal obstruction.

In written answers, Trump said he had no recollection of learning about the meeting until after the election.

Efforts to get the attorney general to take over the investigation

Trump tried to get then-Attorney General Sessions to reverse his recusal and take over the Russia investigation. He also wanted Sessions to investigate Hillary Clinton.

After the May 2017 appointment of the special counsel, for instance: “According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the ‘gist’ of the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from ‘all of it,’ including the Special Counsel’s Russia investigation,” the Mueller report says.

In July 2017, Trump asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter if Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand was “on the team” and would be interested in being the AG and in charge of the Russia investigation. Porter knew Brand, and Trump asked him to speak with her. But Porter told the special counsel’s office that he was uncomfortable with that, understood it to mean Trump wanted someone to end the Russia investigation, and didn’t do it.

The president again brought up investigating Clinton and a reverse-recusal to Sessions later in 2017, and he urged an investigation in tweets in late October that year.

In 2018, Trump publicly criticized Sessions to the press and in tweets. In August 2018, Sessions appeared to respond, saying, “While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”

Trump fired Sessions the day after the midterm elections, Nov. 7, 2018.

In assessing the president’s intent, the Mueller report says there’s evidence the president wanted Sessions to take control of the Russia investigation and “supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope.” In the summer of 2017, Trump knew that he was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice, and that the investigation included his son and son-in-law, due to the Trump Tower meeting disclosure. Trump told Sessions he wanted to be “treated fairly,” and often suggested an attorney general should protect the president. “A reasonable inference from those statements and the President’s actions is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.”

Efforts to squash report that McGahn was ordered to have special counsel removed

According to the report, Trump’s personal counsel called the attorney for White House counsel McGahn and relayed that Trump wanted McGahn to put out a statement denying a New York Times story that Trump had asked him to fire the special counsel. There was just one problem: McGahn said the story was accurate on that point, and he refused to do it.

McGahn told investigators that he was summoned to the Oval Office on Feb. 6, 2018, and that the president told him the Times story “did not ‘look good’ and McGahn needed to correct it.” McGahn said Trump disputed that he told McGahn to “fire” the special counsel, and that he only wanted McGahn to raise conflict of interest issues with Rosenstein and let Rosenstein decide what to do. McGahn said he told the president his recollection of his marching orders differed, that he was told, “Call Rod [Rosenstein]. There are conflicts. Mueller has to go.” McGahn refused to “do a correction,” the report states.

According to McGahn, Trump also criticized McGahn for telling investigators that the president had asked him to have the special counsel removed, and for taking notes during their meeting. “Lawyers don’t take notes,” Trump told him.

The report concludes that, “Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn’s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President’s conduct towards the investigation.”

Trump’s conduct toward Flynn, Manafort

After former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with Trump on Nov. 22, 2017, the president’s personal counsel told Flynn’s attorney’s the action showed “hostility” toward Trump.

After Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements, the press asked Trump whether he would pardon Flynn. Trump said, on Dec. 15, 2017, “I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet. We’ll see what happens. Let’s see. I can say this: When you look at what’s gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry.”

Trump repeatedly, in press interviews and on Twitter, said Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, was being treated unfairly, during his prosecution and jury deliberations.

Also, in January 2018, Manafort told former deputy campaign manager Richard Gates, who had been indicted along with Manafort on multiple felony counts at that point, that the president’s personal attorney had told him they would “take care of us.” Manafort told Gates they should “sit tight” and “we’ll be taken care of,” though he said no one used the word “pardon.”

On June 15, 2018, after Manafort’s bail was revoked, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, floated the possibility of a pardon in media interviews. Two months later, before Manafort pleaded guilty to charges in Washington, D.C., Giuliani told the Washington Post that Trump had asked for advice on pardoning Manafort and other aides and had been told not to do it until the Russia investigation was over.

Some of this section of the Mueller report is redacted due to an ongoing matter.

The report says that the president’s counsel’s statements to Flynn’s counsel “could have had the potential to affect Flynn’s decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn’s counsel.”

But with Manafort, “there is evidence that the President’s actions had the potential to influence Manafort’s decision whether to cooperate with the government,” and Trump’s public statements during the trial “had the potential to influence the trial jury.”

As for intent, the evidence “indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government.” But the Mueller report cites mixed evidence on whether Trump intended to influence a jury. An alternative explanation for some of the president’s comments would be that he “genuinely felt sorry for Manafort” or wanted to influence public opinion. “The President’s comments also could have been intended to continue sending a message to Manafort that a pardon was possible.”

Trump’s conduct toward Cohen

Mueller’s interest in Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, centers around his involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project and the subsequent fallout from Cohen’s false testimony to Congress on the subject.

In 2017, Cohen falsely stated under oath that the project had ended in January 2016, when in fact it had continued at least through June, when Trump had already become the presumptive Republican nominee. Cohen also inaccurately said that he had briefed Trump on the project just three times, and never considered travel to Russia. Cohen later reversed course after pleading guilty to lying to two congressional committees and cooperating with the government. The president, who had publicly and privately supported Cohen until this point, then began attacking his former attorney, much of which we and others have covered before.

With respect to obstruction as it relates to Cohen, the special counsel’s concern was two-pronged: 1) whether Trump or others helped or participated in Cohen’s false congressional testimony, and 2) whether the president did things that would have “a natural tendency” to prevent Cohen from being truthful.

The report concludes that while there is evidence that Trump “knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress,” it “does not establish that the President directed or aided” that false testimony. For example, the special counsel notes that even though Cohen followed a “party line” that aligned with Trump’s statements about Russia, Cohen said that he did not discuss his specific testimony with the president, instead communicating with Trump’s personal counsel. Given that Trump’s lawyer declined to give Mueller an account of those conversations and was not asked to share conversations with the president, the report states that the absence of evidence “precludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.”

As for the president’s actions having a “natural tendency” to prevent Cohen from being truthful, the report goes through Trump’s initially positive public and private messaging to Cohen following an FBI search in April 2018. During this period, the Trump Organization was paying Cohen’s legal fees, and Cohen remembers discussing a possible pardon with the president’s personal lawyer. But after reporting of Cohen’s decision to cooperate with the government in July 2018, Trump quickly shifted gears, calling Cohen a “rat” and saying that Cohen’s family members might have committed crimes. “The evidence concerning this sequence of events could support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate,” the report says, “and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the provision of information or undermine Cohen’s credibility once Cohen began cooperating.”

On the question of intent, the special counsel repeatedly indicates that the evidence “could support an inference” that Trump meant to discourage Cohen from cooperating because it would reflect negatively on the president. That is true for Cohen’s false testimony, which minimized connections between Trump and Russia, and for Trump’s attacks against Cohen’s family once he began cooperating, which the report says “could be viewed as an effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen or others.”

Numerous Indiana elementary school teachers were shot in January as part of a “safe schools” training program. According to the Indiana State Teachers Association, sheriff deputies ordered teachers “into a room four at a time, told them to crouch down and then shot them execution-style with pellets in rapid succession,” leaving several of them bloodied and many of them screaming in terror. The teachers union is “is lobbying lawmakers to add [legislative] language prohibiting teachers from being shot with any sort of ammunition” during school safety drills, according to the Indianapolis Star.

The Indiana program was part of the school lockdown drills occurring across the nation spurred in part by a Colorado massacre that occurred twenty years ago on April 20. Twelve students and one teacher died in a shooting spree by two students at Columbine High School. The Columbine carnage helped inspire subsequent school shootings, especially a Newtown, Connecticut attack in 2012.

While the media is vividly reminding Americans of the Colorado killings, few people remember how the Clinton administration rushed to exploit the killings. Attorney General Janet Reno praised the local police response as "extraordinary" and "a textbook" example of "how to do it the right way." President Bill Clinton declared that "we look with admiration at the... the police officers who rushed to the scene to save lives." Clinton invoked the Columbine killings almost every day from April 20 through mid-June 1999, when the House of Representatives narrowly defeated Clinton-championed gun control legislation.

In reality, “No efforts were made to stop the assault," concluded William Erickson, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice who headed a commission that issued a damning 2001 report on the Columbine killings. Instead, hundreds of police waited outside until long after the two perpetrators had committed suicide.

Appalling police failures turned a multiple homicide into a historic massacre. A SWAT team had entered the building early on but Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone ordered it to withdraw. Police spokesmen said most of the SWAT teams were not sent in "for fear that they might set off a new gunfight," the New York Times reported. SWAT teams did not enter the room where the killers lay until hours after the shooting stopped. A badly wounded school teacher, Dave Sanders, bled to death because the SWAT team took four hours to reach the room he was in - even though students placed a large sign announcing "1 Bleeding to Death" in the window.

Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone later explained: "We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get in. We were way outgunned." However, SWAT team members had flak jackets and submachine guns - far better protection and weaponry than the unreliable TEC-9 handgun, semiautomatic rifle, and shotguns that the killers touted.

Fears for "officer safety" paralyzed the police response. Steve Davis, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, said, "We had no idea who was a victim and who was a suspect. And a dead police officer would not be able to help anyone." Evan Todd, a Columbine student who was wounded in the initial attack, escaped outside and then explained to a dozen policemen exactly what was happening inside; he was told “to calm down and take my frustrations elsewhere." After the 2001 report was released, Randy Brown, the father of a Columbine student, scoffed in the Rocky Mountain News: “When children are being murdered... it is important that you establish a perimeter. Do not intervene in the shooting. Officer safety is a priority"?

Unfortunately, law enforcement learned too little from Littleton. At the Parkland school in Florida last year, eight sheriff’s deputies cowered outside while the shooting rampage left 17 dead. A local cop who arrived during the shooting was urged not to enter the building: “Hey, be careful. The guy’s got a rifle,” a deputy told him. After the killings, the local sheriff’s department put out a deluge of false claims that were debunked by later revelations. Nikolas Cruz should have been arrested numerous times because of violence and threats at school and elsewhere but school authorities may have avoided charging him because of an Obama administration school grant program that sought to curb the “school-to-prison” pipeline for minority students. The FBI also dropped the ball despite receiving at least two explicit calls warning about Cruz.

Unfortunately, school safety policies have long been dominated by institutional hysteria fanned by politicians, bureaucrats, and much of the media. The federal Education Department reported last year that "nearly 240 schools ... reported at least 1 incident involving a school-related shooting" in the 2015-16 school year. National Public Radio investigated and found that the feds had exaggerated school shootings by twenty-fold; NPR could confirm only 11 incidents. Cleveland was credited with 37 shooting incidents when in reality it was simply a report of 37 schools noting “possession of a knife or a firearm.” One school system was listed as a shooting locale for an incident involving a pair of scissors. But fanning hysteria over school hysteria is mother’s milk for politicians who want to confiscate private firearms.

The #NeverAgain movement that arose after last year’s Parkland shootings ignores how government officials cannot be trusted to behave honestly or responsibly to save student lives. New gun control laws will do nothing to boost either the competence or courage of the police when every second counts. Unfortunately, there is also no cure for the political exploitation of such tragedies.

Ginger White is a woman on a mission. And that mission, it appears, is to keep former pizza guru Herman Cain off the Federal Reserve Board, and she’s willing to go as far as describing Cain’s private parts to the Senate Banking Committee.



An aside: There are three things in life that I never want to happen.

1. I don’t want my house to catch fire while I’m naked and then have to stand outside naked while waiting for the fire truck.

2. I never want to see a squirrel falling out of a tree while having a seizure. This happened to me once while switching classes on the University of Maryland’s campus, and it was arguably the saddest, weirdest, most horrible thing I’ve witnessed. I don’t do well with multiple emotions.

3. And I swear I had this on my list before learning about it, but I don’t want to learn about Herman Cain’s privates. Ever.

According to the New York Daily News, White and Cain had an extra-marital affair that Cain denies ever happened. White says that she’s willing to sit in front of a Congressional Committee and describe intimate parts of his body that only a woman who creeped with Herman Cain would know.

“I ask Herman Cain, if I never had a sexual relationship with you, how would I be in a position to describe parts of your body that are not visible?” White, 53, asked rhetorically during a Thursday press conference with her lawyer Gloria Allred.

“Do us all a favor and remove yourself from consideration for the Federal Reserve Board,” the Atlanta woman said. “You are a liar and you don’t deserve the public’s confidence in such an important position.”

White said that Cain, who would become Trump’s most important black person should he get the position and Ben Carson leaves his post as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has no business being in consideration for the position because he cheated on his wife.

President Trump announced on April 4th that Cain was in consideration for the position, but many have argued that Cain wouldn’t have the votes to fill the seat.

White isn’t the first woman to claim that Cain carried on inappropriate relations with women.

From the Daily News:

Cain, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza and ex-president of the National Restaurant Association, was a Tea Party darling who abandoned his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination when multiple allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in late 2011. Sharon Bialek, a marketing professional, stepped forward in November 2011 to say Cain reached under her skirt and pushed her head toward his crotch inside a parked car after they met in Washington D.C. to discuss her career in 1997. Bialek said she was shocked by the overture and asked Cain what he was doing. “You want a job, right?” Cain allegedly said, according to Bialek. The single mom from Chicago said she spoke out after three other women alleged Cain harassed them at the National Restaurant Association, which he ran from 1996 to 1999.

White claims that she come forward in 2011, after seeing Cain vehemently deny any wrongdoings, to announce her extramarital affair with the pizza father, which she claims went on for 13 years.

“I was shocked by the manner in which he harshly reacted to the allegations (from Bialek and the others). He began bashing, criticizing, and attacking the character of these women who came forward,” White recalled Thursday, the Daily News reports.



“I came forward in 2011 because I felt it was very important for the public to know the truth about his relationship with me,” she said.

Allred, who also represents Bialek, said Thursday that her clients “are willing to testify under oath” if Trump throws the nomination Cain’s way.



“We call on Mr. Cain to do the right thing and spare all of us another bruising and painful confirmation hearing,” Allred said.

“Those who are in high governmental positions have a special responsibility to the truth, and to be role models for the truth, and to live the truth. Not just to talk about it, but to live it in actions.”

Cain, 73, is founder of America Fighting Back, and much like the president claims that all of the women are lying. And because Cain doesn’t know when to step down, we are probably going to hear about his private parts, because earlier this week he told the Wall Street Journal that he was “very committed” to the vetting process for the Fed board position despite all of the allegations against him.

The Daily News notes that all of this might be a complete waste of time as “four Republican senators including Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Utah’s Mitt Romney already have said they would vote against Cain, all but dooming his ability to pass senate hearings.”

Many believe that Cain loves him some Trump, so much so that he couldn’t sit on an independent board and not serve his master.

What does all of this mean?

Well it means that if Trump picks Cain for the position, then chances are high that we are going to have to hear about the former Pizza maker’s eggplant.

I know, I’m sorry.
北アイルランドのロンドンデリーの住宅街で18日深夜、イギリスからの分離を求める過激派によるテロ計画があるとして、警察が捜索を始めたところ、抵抗する人々が火炎瓶を投げつけるなどして、暴動になりました。



混乱の中で、何者かが無差別に発砲し、現場で取材をしていた女性記者が撃たれて死亡しました。



警察はカトリック系の過激派組織ＩＲＡ＝アイルランド共和軍から分派した組織が関わった可能性が高いとみて、テロ事件として捜査を始めました。



北アイルランドでは、イギリスからの分離の是非をめぐり、1960年代からカトリック系とプロテスタント系の住民の間で紛争が続き、3000人以上が死亡しました。



およそ20年前に和平合意が成立しましたが、イギリスのＥＵ＝ヨーロッパ連合からの離脱問題をきっかけに、イギリスからの分離を求める声が聞かれるようになり、再び対立が激化するのではないかと不安が広がっています。



事件後、北アイルランドの各政党は共同で声明を発表し、「事件は和平そのものへの攻撃で、地域社会から支持を得られるものではない」として、住民に対し冷静に対応するよう訴えています。

Manchester United are prepared to listen to offers for Romelu Lukaku this summer, with the Belgium striker open to a move away from Old Trafford.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is gearing up for what he has promised will be a “ruthless” overhaul and Lukaku could be one of those who makes way but only if an acceptable bid was forthcoming.

Inter Milan, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich are believed to be among the clubs who have been sounded out about the striker.

Federico Pastorello, Lukaku’s representative, appeared to be putting the player in the shop window when he admitted in a television interview this month that his client’s future was “very open”, a move to Italy appealed and that the Belgian was “someone who loves to know a different culture, a different football”. Lukaku himself talked up the prospect of playing in Italy last October.

Antonio Conte has been linked with Inter and Juventus and it is thought the former Chelsea manager, who is also represented by Pastorello, would be interested in signing Lukaku if he landed either of those jobs.
Established powers have always seek methods to control populations. In the past, their techniques were outright violence. However, as savage techniques created martyrs, resistance became stronger. Learning from past mistakes, the financial elites ceased using force and became more sophisticated in their methods. Amongst the many new tools the oligarchs have in their kit, porn is one of their most potent.

One should ask themselves why is all this porn freely available on the internet? There is a reason for this. As a rule, when the service is free, the consumer is the product. The supposedly free Facebook app sells your personal data. The free Google Maps tracks your every moves and use that data to create profits. Free service means you are the product, and porn is no different. But product to whom you may ask? You are a product not just to advertisers forming up profiles on you, but also to special interest groups who want to keep a population tamed.

I suspect established powers subsidize the porn industry to keep populations weak and mentally foggy. Porn deeply disturbs the psyche, making the person unable to concentrate. Inability for deep concentration results in difficulty learning complex tasks such as engineering or physics. The end result is a society full of disposal laborers who lack the know-how to provide for themselves. The lack of virility is an inevitable result from sexual dissipation also makes them indifferent to the countless injustices that plague them.

Now let me make it clear that this situation is as much our fault as it is the elites. We are not a powerless victim here. It is our weakness in the face of pornography that gives them control. The product you sell when you watch pornography is your character, your magnetic strength, and your willpower. Let’s drop this bizarre voyeuristic habit of porn, and patiently learn to build our character and skills so that we may serve each other.
The words continual and continuous are like twins: they both come from continue, but they get mad if you get them confused. Continual means start and stop, while continuous means never-ending.

Continual things come and go, like arguments or rain. If your parents' continual arguing drives you crazy, just be glad they stop sometimes! With continual rain, you'll get some sunny breaks, as Ireland's forecasters like to say. Or in this bit about the birth of Lynyrd Skynyrd:

There were continual battles between authority figures like Skinner and the free spirits who formed the band. (herald-review.com)

Continuous, on the other hand, is nonstop. If the young Skynyrds had a continuous argument with authority, they'd never stop, not even to sing "Free Bird." With continuous rain, you'll never see the sun. A flight or a wire can be continuous:

Jongeward and Woodhouse ended up breaking the record for continuous flight. They stayed in the air for 1,124 hours. (Yuma Sun) A telegraphic signal would go more than seven times around the earth in one second if it travelled on one continuous wire. (Elmer Ellsworth Burns)

Continual is chronic, like a cough that comes and goes, or a teenager's sporadic fights with The Man. Continuous is like a circle, or a nightmare carousel that never ever stops. Neither one is the evil twin; they're both moody.
A judge says the federal government can be sued by Flint residents who blame the Environmental Protection Agency for waiting too long to intervene in the city's water crisis.

Federal Judge Linda Parker didn't determine whether EPA employees were negligent when Flint's water system became contaminated with lead in 2014 and 2015. The decision at this stage is more narrow, with the judge saying Thursday that the government isn't immune to a lawsuit.

Parker says EPA employees knew lead was leaching from old pipes because Flint's water wasn't being properly treated. She says the EPA also knew that Michigan regulators were misleading residents about the quality of the water.

The judge says the "lies went on for months."

The Associated Press sent an email to the EPA seeking comment Friday.
Impact Wrestling's Gail Kim is one of the most respected and decorated performers in the business. The trailblazing Hall of Famer helped lay the foundation for the Knockouts division and women's wrestling we see today. Proud of what she accomplished during her in-ring career, Kim stepped away from the camera and transitioned into a behind the scene role. Though the last few months Tessa Blanchard pushed the buttons of the veteran.

So much in fact Kim is coming out of retirement for one more match. The two will collide at Impact Wrestling's Rebellion, available on FITE TV and Pay-Per-View April 28 at 8 p.m. ET. Before the big test, Kim sat down with Wrestling Inc. for a candid Q&A.

What was it like for you when that announcement was made about your return to the ring?

I will say it was a decision that wasn't taken lightly. That's for sure. I think a lot of people fan-wise, and I've had this comment a lot on social media. "Oh, she is coming out of retirement for the millionth time." I've actually never come out of retirement yet. This is actually my first time coming out of retirement. It would have to be for a very good reason. I will say I think Tessa Blanchard in herself is making a big splash in the women's wrestling scene right now.

She is probably one of the best, if not the best in terms of outside WWE and throughout the independent circle and other promotions. That was another factor. Her attitude has always been her biggest enemy I feel like. For me, looking back on my career, I see so many similarities between her and I. The good and the bad. The good I would say we are both so passionate about wrestling. We both want to be the best. For me, wanted to be the best. And still in terms of this match I want to prove to the fans I can still go with a woman who is almost half my age. Those are the main reasons for me to come out of retirement. Yes, people my first time.

How have you been mentally and physically preparing for this match? You mention someone who is younger than you, you want to prove to everyone age is just a number. I've always thought you've stayed in great shape and maintain a high level of performance, which we've always expected from you. I'm sure you've put a lot of pressure on yourself in giving the best performance knowing this could be the last match you have.

You pretty much hit the nail on the head there. Throughout my career, especially the second half of my career, I was always nerdy or anal when it came to how I prepared for my matches. I won't lie, it's pretty much consumed my thoughts the last couple of weeks and getting into physical shape. I can stay in shape, and you can look fit from the outside, but stepping into that ring and having a match with one of the best athletes in the business right now.

That's another thing. I will say I got in the ring a couple of weeks ago, and I literally felt everything. Back when you are young and Tessa's age, we all feel invincible. I plan to put it all out there that night. I will say the preparation has been quite different I'd say from five, ten years ago. I'll say that. If anything, my nerdiness when it come to preparation has gone up ten-fold. I've always had a lot of pressure on myself, but I'm not going to lie, I feel a lot of pressure to give the fans everything they expect plus more.

This match is taking place in Toronto, Canada. Somewhere near and dear to your heart. What does it mean to have this match there?

I didn't even know when this match would happen. I had agreed to do it with Impact management. They are the ones decided it would be at Rebellion in Toronto, which gives me that little bit of home-field advantage. That's exciting because I will have my family there. They weren't there for my last match last year. It will be special in that regard. Of course, having that confidence of having the fans behind you in your hometown is always special.

Is there anyone you've been working with within the Impact Wrestling roster to help you get ready with your workouts? Is there any tape you've been studying specifically?

Not specific, I've been watching all kinds of wrestling. I've been going back to old school wrestling and back before my time with Shawn [Michaels] and Bret [Hart]. Even the psychology of Hunter [Triple H] and Shawn as well. I watch different people for different reasons. I'll watch certain people for psychology and certain people for match creativeness. In terms of preparation, I've just really been working on my cardio a lot because people don't realize even if you run on a treadmill and then you do a match, it's not the same.

I went into Jay Lethal's school a couple of times in the ring. I'm going to hit the ring a couple of times this week. I'm in San Antonio for a show right now, and I'm not scheduled to wrestle. But you never know what you might see. That's about it. More of it is mental than anything.

What does the husband think of you returning to the ring?

He is just like don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. He has always been so supportive and one of my biggest fans. He just always has belief in me. He is like, "You're going to kill it." I'm the difficult wife saying, "But no. You don't understand. It's not the same." He says the same thing. "You're fit. You're fine." I'm like, "It's not the same when you're in a match with one of the best athletes now." I have to step up to that level again.

One of the things I appreciate about you is you're very vocal on social media with your opinions and stand by them no matter what reaction you get. Even when you get, "Stay in your lane." The mentality is I can say what I want. It's my platform. Just because I'm a public figure doesn't mean I don't have an opinion. Was there ever a point for you where you wanted to walk away from social media?

There are days where I'm over social media. Obviously, for us as wrestlers, it's a way to promote ourselves. I've never had the thought that I wanted to shut it down at all. But there are days where I'm just going to step away from it. I do find Twitter to be more negative than Instagram. Instagram is not so bad. I think it's because of the pictures and see a face where on Twitter people forget we are human beings. They have anonymity as well, so it makes it an easier place to be negative. If I find there are days where people are especially negative, I'll just turn it off.

But of course, everyone who follows me knows I'm going to fight back. Depends on who it is. Depends on my mood. Depends what it is. I just said it today that the majority of fans who do troll are when I talk politics, it's a Trump follower. If I get specific about the office in WWE and the truth of how they treat the talent because I don't have an idea how they treat the office. I'm always going to tell the truth. I always tell people this business is essentially a monopoly. So, whether you work for WWE or don't' work for WWE, you still are almost afraid to speak up because you never want to close that bridge or lose that relationship to be hired. Some people want to get Hall of Fame or be re-hired. They just don't want to burn that bridge. For me, I worked there twice and know it was the worst experiences of my life. Not just my career. It was very toxic for me. I know I don't have a desire to work there, so I can speak the truth and one of the few who can or feel comfortable enough too.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ranjeet Bahadur Srivastava has asked the voters to cast votes in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi if they wanted to ‘destroy’ Muslims, a media report said.

The news gathering Asian News International (ANI) quoted the BJP leader as saying: “In the past five years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made attempts to break the morale of the Muslims. Vote for PM Modi if you want to destroy the breed of Muslims. Despite Partition, the Muslim population is increasing in the country and soon they will able to get the grip on the power through voting.”

He said after the Lok Sabha elections, the party will bring machines from China to shave 10-12 thousands of Muslims and later will force them to adopt Hindu religion, the report quoted him as saying.

Voting for the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh concluded at 5 pm with a turnout of 67.55 per cent on Thursday. The remaining 64 seats will go to polls in the next five phases of elections. The counting of votes will take place on May 23.
We have an update on the ride loading procedures for Twisted Timbers:

For those of you who have had the chance to experience the coaster’s twists and turns, you know this ride is dynamic, thrilling and personally one of my favorites (anyone else love those three airtime hills as much as I?).

While those twist, turns and fabulous hills are some of the best parts of this coaster, they may have meant the loss of personal belongings for you or a friend if an item came loose during the ride. The coaster’s unique forces and elements may cause personal items to become loose even when placed snugly in a pocket.

For this reason, we will be reinforcing our loose article policy with the addition of metal detectors at the ride’s station to identify items (such as cell phones and keys) that must be stored separately prior to riding. This will ensure the safety of other riders, and it enables you to return home with the items you brought to the park.

A few key things:

You will be allowed to carry your phone, keys and other small items with you through the queue line. Bags, hats, etc. will need to be stored in a nearby locker or with a non-rider.

Once you arrive at the station, please have your cell phone and keys in hand. All riders MUST go through the metal detectors.

Once you’re ready to board the train, place cell phones and keys in the zippered pouch below the seat. All other loose articles must be secured in a cargo pocket, left with a non-rider, or placed in a locker. All glasses must be secured with an athletic strap.

Then, it’s RIDE TIME.

At Kings Dominion, safety is our top priority and we have rules in place so our guests have a safe and enjoyable experience here. Please keep in mind that Virginia has a rider responsibility law which states that guests are required to follow all rider rules; they’re posted at ride entrances and available online. Be safe – and enjoy the ride!
This month, Tesla hits its first employment target with New York state, negotiated around the siting of its Gigafactory 2.

The deal, part of Governor Andrew Cuomo’s troubled “Buffalo Billion” development initiative, requires 500 workers by April 2019 and 1,460 citywide, with 500 in manufacturing by April 2020. In exchange Tesla received $750 million in sweeteners from the state to build and outfit the factory to produce its solar roof, a product that’s seen numerous delays.

Tesla told Greentech Media that it’s already met its 2019 target. But the company’s precarious financial position and whiplash sales strategies have others concerned about the future of the plant and the solar roof itself, which CEO Elon Musk has framed as a keystone product.

Challenges at the Buffalo plant are just one of many questions hanging over the future of Tesla’s solar business. Residential installations at the former SolarCity unit have dropped precipitously in recent years.

Tesla declined to comment on concerns about meeting its 2020 jobs target. But the uncertainty around Gigafactory 2 comes at a critical juncture for the company. Mixed signals abound.

In its latest quarterly financial report, Tesla called 2018 “the most pivotal year” in its history. In a January email announcing it would shrink its total workforce by 7 percent, the company also recognized it was “the most challenging.”

The automaker recently clocked its first quarters of profit in years, met seemingly impossible vehicle-production goals, and laid off large numbers of employees. It also shifted its sales strategy multiple times, first announcing it would close most of its retail stores, then saying it would keep “significantly more” stores open.

Several former Tesla employees told Greentech Media that meeting its job targets under those circumstances will be tough.

“At best, [meeting the jobs target] will be challenging for them,” said a former executive with knowledge of the development of the solar roof product and who left the company in 2017.

The move to pare back retail stores, where Tesla may have been able to generate leads for solar roof sales, would seem to further cloud the factory’s future, the former executive added.

"$1 million per job?"

At the end of 2018, Tesla reported over 800 employees at Gigafactory 2. About half are employees of Panasonic, Tesla’s partner at the plant. After cutting 7 percent of its overall workforce in January, Tesla told Greentech Media it still has more than 750 employees working there.

While that number is well above the target for 2019, a former production employee among those laid off in January voiced concerns about the 2020 state target.

“Before the layoffs, I thought they were going to be hitting it, because they were still looking for people. Toward the end of November, they were hiring [for] everything,” the employee said. “But after the layoffs happened, I do not think they’re going to be reaching that goal.”

State lawmakers share the concern.

“It would be my hope on behalf of our community that they meet the target, and that many people are gainfully employed there,” state Assembly Member Robin Schimminger, who represents a district that overlaps with part of Buffalo, said in an interview. “But they don’t seem to be on that trajectory at this point.”

Tesla committed to bringing 1,460 employees to Buffalo by 2020, and some of that pool may work outside the Gigafactory. It must deliver 5,000 jobs to New York within a decade of the facility’s completion, according to a 2016 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In exchange, the state would invest $750 million to build the plant and lease it back to the company for $2 a year plus utilities, according to a 2017 SEC filing. Starting in 2020, if Tesla fails to meet the agreement’s terms, it faces a penalty of $41.2 million for each year it falls short.

In February, state legislators grilled Howard Zemsky, the CEO of Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, about the jobs number and whether the state would enforce the penalty.

“So we spent $1 million per job?” asked state Senator Liz Krueger.

Tesla also has a deal with Panasonic associated with the plant, with Panasonic partnering to produce PV cells and modules and Tesla incorporating those cells into the solar roof. In exchange for a long-term purchase commitment from Tesla, Panasonic agreed to cover capital costs. Tesla declined to comment on whether Panasonic pays Tesla to lease space.

New York’s Department of Labor did not respond to requests for comment on Tesla’s reported job numbers. But ahead of the round of layoffs in January, Tesla did not file a notification tied to the state’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. That law requires businesses to give warning prior to layoffs if they impact 25+ workers that make up at least a third of all employees at the site. That suggests the layoffs didn’t significantly cut into Tesla’s employment at the plant.

A spokesperson at Empire State Development told Greentech Media “the state is confident Tesla will meet its obligations,” but confirmed it will enforce the penalty if the company does not.

Assembly Member Schimminger said he believes the state will hold Tesla to the agreement.

“If they were to walk away, they would walk away,” said Schimminger. “But [they] still have an obligation to the state of New York under the terms of that deal.”

“A very complex engineering feat”

Tesla introduced its solar roof in October of 2016, just ahead of officially acquiring SolarCity. Since that unveiling, information on product development and installations has been relatively scarce. The company has accepted solar roof orders through its website since 2017 and notes that customer installations are underway, but it doesn’t offer buyers a timeline on when installations may take place.

Media reports on the product have been concerning. In August, Reuters laid out delays at the Buffalo Gigafactory, which is supposed to produce 1 gigawatt of solar capacity per year when fully ramped. That report noted that, at the time, only 12 solar roof systems had been connected to the grid in California.

Tesla told Greentech Media that number is low but declined to offer specifics. According to an analysis of more recent records from the state's three largest investor-owned utilities, the state looks to have connected just 21.

Former employees say the solar roof’s development process has been difficult from the start.

At the time the previously quoted executive left the company, in 2017, the product was still in early stages. Developers were working on how to cut glass safely, negotiating weight constraints and coping with the product’s complicated installation.

“The solar roof approach of Tesla is unlike anything that has come in the past in terms of aesthetics. […] It’s making solar absolutely disappear on a roof,” said the former executive. “That’s a very complex engineering feat.”

Encumbering progress further: Each installation is basically bespoke.

In recent months, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published several applications Tesla filed in 2017 regarding solar roof tiles (patent applications are generally published 18 months after filed, though there are exceptions). One published in late February focuses on “flexible solar roofing modules.” Another, published in late March, concerns “optical-filtering coating for managing color of a solar roof tile.” Another published that month involves “moisture-resistant solar cells for solar roof tiles.”

Those applications imply work continues, and in its latest financial report, Tesla said it would ramp solar roof production in 2019 “with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities…based on the design iterations and testing underway.”

Several former employees suggested that not many roofs have been installed so far, though none could cite specific numbers.

“The [deployment] numbers that I think they had hoped for are probably not going to happen,” said another senior executive, who left the company last year.

A drag on the national rooftop solar market

Meanwhile, doubts continue to swirl about another critical piece of Tesla’s solar master plan: its downstream rooftop installation business.

For months, solar market analysts have warned that Tesla’s brand-driven and online-focused sales strategy, unprecedented among its peers, would likely hurt the company’s solar arm.

And though Elon Musk in March named 2019 “the year of the solar roof and Powerwall” and stopped by the Buffalo factory in April, Tesla’s residential solar business seems to be languishing.

Data from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables shows the company’s residential installation volumes nearly halved from 650 megawatts in 2016 to 352 megawatts in 2017, and then tumbled again last year to 208 megawatts.

Source: Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables

The pullback may be strategic. SVP of Energy Sanjay Shah has said the company doesn’t want to grow “just by chasing volume.”

In any case, Tesla Energy still makes up a small portion of the company’s overall business. Energy generation and storage revenues came in at $1.6 billion last year, compared to automotive revenue in excess of $18.5 billion.

Still, slowing sales of residential solar systems brings up the question of where the company’s solar roof product will go once the factory is online.

Analysts suggest that Tesla may plan to rely on its brand power to turn sales of its luxury vehicles into leads for its battery product and boutique solar roof.

That may not lead to the wide buy-in that Musk peddled as a linchpin in the sustainable Tesla lifestyle when the company acquired SolarCity. But Allison Mond, a senior solar analyst at WoodMac, says Tesla no longer seems to be selling that solar-powered life.

“It seems to me we’re just going to continue to see their installation volumes plummet,” she said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Friday called for the House of Representatives to start impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump in the wake of the public release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 19, 2019

“The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help,” Warren added on Twitter. “Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.”

Warren spent all day Thursday traveling back east from a trip to Colorado and Utah, reading the 448-page report on her flight, according to an aide. She continued to read the report last night before reaching this conclusion.

Warren’s announcement is significant. She’s the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to call for impeachment, and the most high-profile Democrat to do so ― at a time when most leaders of her party are backing away from it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has consistently said she’s not in favor of moving forward on it.

And even after the Mueller report, Democratic leaders seemed unconvinced. Both House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) rejected trying to remove Trump on Thursday. Hoyer said it was “not worthwhile” and Nadler said it was “too early to talk about that.”

The fact that Warren was the first leading candidate to get out front on impeachment isn’t entirely surprising. She’s also been willing to go further than other candidates on issues like breaking up big tech companies, eliminating the filibuster and imposing a wealth tax, putting her 2020 rivals on the spot about their own positions.

Taking into account the Justice Department’s position that the president can’t face charges while in office, the Mueller report stops short of calling Trump a criminal. But despite Attorney General William Barr’s attempts to spin the public perception of the report in Trump’s favor, the Mueller investigation laid out an extensive pattern of plainly unethical and seemingly criminal behavior to obstruct an ongoing law enforcement investigation.

The only reason that Trump didn’t obstruct justice in most cases, the report suggests, was because his staffers refused to obey what they perceived as illegal orders. The report also states that, had Trump’s aides carried out his orders, they could have been charged with crimes.

“The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” the report states. “Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.”

Warren has not been an especially loud voice on potential Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the 2016 election, so the fact that she’s now backing impeachment is notable. Previously, she said she wanted to wait and see what was in the Mueller report before taking a position.

In one of her tweets Friday, she said she took seriously the report’s conclusion that the work is now in the hands of Congress to get to the bottom of the matter.

Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: “Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.” The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 19, 2019

Polls conducted in March by Monmouth University and CNN/SSRS found support for Trump’s impeachment at 44% and 36% respectively ― several points below Trump’s overall disapproval numbers. In both surveys, two-thirds or more of Democrats said they wanted to see Trump impeached.

But the direction of the public’s shift differed: Monmouth’s poll, which was completed in early March, found that support for impeachment had risen slightly since November, due mainly to increased support from independents. CNN’s more recent survey, by contrast, found that Democrats’ appetite for impeachment had dipped since December, in the wake of Pelosi’s comments opposing the idea.
Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis, who served with Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, defended Barr against accusations he misled Congress in connection with the Mueller report, saying he wouldn’t “violate his oath.”

Lewis described Barr as “a fine man” on “America’s Newsroom” on Friday. “He's an honorable man. He crosses t’s, he dots i’s. He is not the kind of guy that would come in there and violate his oath and do the kind of things that Jerry Nadler’s accusing him of.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ISSUES SUBPOENA FOR 'COMPLETE AND UNREDACTED' MUELLER REPORT

Lewis made the statements in reaction to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler’s push for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s “complete and unredacted” Russia report. Nadler and other Dems say Barr has misled Congress and the public on President Trump's behalf.

Nadler, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena Friday to obtain the "complete and unredacted" version of Mueller's report, as well as the underlying materials.

On “Good Morning America” on Friday Nadler said, “Barr has revealed himself as an agent of the president, not the attorney general of the entire American people.”

In response, Lewis said, “I don't buy it one bit.”

He added, “You look at the report. Look at the Mueller report. Look at what Barr was actually saying in his four-page letter of a few weeks ago. It tracks very, very closely.”

“This isn't just Barr who’s coming out, pulling this stuff out of the air. He's got a team of dedicated professionals, lawyers. [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein also participated.

“All of this represents their collective best judgment.”

MUELLER REPORT IGNITES NEW DEM BATTLE OVER IMPEACHMENT

Lewis said he was “not surprised” by Nadler's subpoena, which reminded him of the “old days” when he was trying cases as a prosecutor.

“There was nothing, frankly nothing you could do that would fully please the other side,” said Lewis.

Lewis also weighed in Friday on Barr’s determination there was not sufficient evidence on the obstruction front, even though Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump committed this offense.

“In truth, this was Barr's ultimate decision,” said Lewis. “I mean, you've got Mueller, who is the special prosecutor. He is appointed and still works under the auspices of the office of the Department of Justice, so it’s Barr's ultimate decision here.”
April 19, 2019 Libya - U.S. Reveals Support For Hafter's Side The situation on the ground in Libya has changed little since we last looked at it two weeks ago. The Libyan National Army (LNA) troops of General Hafter attack the militias which support the UN recognized government in Tripoli from the south. The LNA still lacks forces for a larger break through. Several objects at the front changed hands several times. There are bloody skirmishes but no big fights. Those are still to come.

Map by South Front - bigger Some people doubt that Hafter can be successful: Analysts believe that Haftar over-estimates the strength of his LNA. They say the controversial field marshal, who backs an administration rival to the GNA based in eastern Libya, was counting on a quick collapse of Tripoli militias. But pro-GNA reinforcements from around Tripoli rushed to assist in driving back his forces. It was never clear if Hafter really hoped that a lightning attack on Tripoli would achieve a fast victory, or if his sudden move was intended to rally support from outside. He is now certainly getting such support and that will be to his decisive advantage in the longer play. As we described it: Hafter has open support from France, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Russia. The Trump administration is not interested to step into the mess. Hafter is an old CIA asset and if he takes control there is a good chance that the U.S. will have influence over him. As long as Libyan oil flows and keeps the global oil price down Trump will be happy. Russia is trying to stay in the background to not give the anti-Russian forces in Washington an excuse to intervene. The Muslim Brothers, supported by Turkey and Qatar, are still in play in Misrata but have otherwise lost their influence on the ground. Since then the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia pledged tens of millions of dollars to support Hafter's move on Tripoli. During the last week Hafter visited President Sisi of Egypt. Europe is disunited over the issue. Italy wants to keep its influence in its former colony Libya and its historical position in the Libyan oil industry. It is also concerned about a new wave of refugees. It supports the government in Tripoli. France is supporting Hafter with an eye on taking over some oil business. It is also concerned about Islamist activities in former French colonies west and south of Libya. With Italy and France in a clinch, the European Union only issued a weak statement that called for a stop of fighting without naming any side. Concern over the militias which support the Tripoli government increased too. They not as harmless as many seem to have thought: A week after an aspiring strongman launched a surprise attack on the Libyan capital, an assortment of criminal gangs and extremists are rushing into the fight against him, raising new questions for the United States and other Western powers that have condemned his attack.

...

But an increasingly unsavory cast has joined the coalition against him, including a group closely tied to a militia sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations; an extremist warlord sanctioned for undermining Libya’s stability; and other militia leaders sanctioned for migrant trafficking. That mix so alarms Western powers that some may deem General Hifter the lesser evil. Yesterday the U.S., which had said little when Hafter launched his assault on Tripoli, came out of the closet: The United States and Russia both said Thursday they could not support a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire in Libya at this time, diplomats said, as mortar bombs crashed down on a suburb of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Russia objects to the British-drafted resolution blaming eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar for the latest flare-up in violence when his Libyan National Army (LNA) advanced to the outskirts of Tripoli earlier this month, diplomats said. The United States gave no reason for its position on the draft resolution ... Today we learn that Trump spoke with Hafter several days ago: President Donald Trump spoke on Monday with a Libyan strongman whose forces are advancing on the nation’s capital, the White House said, in a move that may undermine support for the country’s internationally recognized government.

...

Trump discussed “ongoing counterterrorism efforts and the need to achieve peace and stability in Libya” with Haftar, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement. Gidley called Haftar by the title “field marshal.” “The president recognized Field Marshal Haftar’s significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya’s oil resources, and the two discussed a shared vision for Libya’s transition to a stable, democratic political system,” Gidley said. The key point for Trump is the oil price. His administration put sanctions on sales of Iranian and Venezuelan oil. Since the beginning of the year crude oil prices rallied from the low $50 per barrel to over $70 per barrel. Trump plans to reduce waivers he gave to some of the countries that continue to buy Iranian oil. That would further decrease Iran's output. Any additional disruption of Libya's oil production would increase the oil price and harm the U.S. economy. It would thereby make Trump's plan for total sanctions on Iranian oil impossible. Hafter controls most of Libya's oil supplies. With open backing from the U.S., Russia and France, support from the military in Egypt, and with enough Saudi cash to finance his army, he surely has all the needed support to sustain a longer fight. His next move will likely be against the small air force the Misrata gangs assembled. The U.S. might give him a helping hand in that. Hafter could then close down the airspace for flights from Turkey and Qatar. That would cut into the resupply Misrata and Tripoli need for a longer fight. Those who say that "there is no military solution" to the situation in Libya will likely be proven wrong. Hafter has all he needs to win the fight.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyers spent at least 10 hours reviewing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election before it was made public, two of the lawyers told Reuters on Friday.

Rudy Giuliani, Jay Sekulow and two other Trump lawyers went to the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday and Wednesday for an early look at the 448-page report into whether Trump’s team colluded with Russia and whether Trump obstructed the investigation, which was released to the public on Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr, who has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers over his handling of the Mueller probe, said on Thursday that both White House counsel and Trump’s personal lawyers had been allowed to review the redacted report.

Barr gave no details about how much access they were given but Sekulow and Giuliani said they reviewed copies of the report from about 4 p.m. until at least 9 p.m. on Tuesday and from 10:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, taking notes on legal pads.

The lawyers said they gave up their cellphones and other electronic devices before being led into a Justice Department conference room in a restricted area known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), designed to ensure secret information stays secure.

“We were doing a lot of reading, not talking,” Sekulow told Reuters, referring to himself, Giuliani, and Jane and Marty Raskin.

“I had at least 30 pages of notes,” said Giuliani.

Sekulow pushed back against Democrats’ complaints that Barr had tried to help Trump by giving his lawyers an early look at the report.

“Our client was the subject of an inquiry,” Sekulow said, explaining that the team of lawyers sent a note to the Justice Department last week asking to see the report. “We believed it was an appropriate request to make.”

The disclosure followed news reports this week that Justice Department officials discussed Mueller’s conclusions with White House lawyers before the release.

Giuliani said the preview reassured them that the report did not contain any bombshells.

“It gave us some confidence the people who hate him will hate him, the people who love him will love him, and the people in between were not going to be persuaded,” he said.

After the first session, the lawyers went back to Sekulow’s Capitol Hill offices, ordered in Chinese food and created an outline of their own about the most important details in the report, they said.

On Wednesday night, they went out for Mexican food. And on Thursday night, after the report’s release, they celebrated at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.

Although Mueller’s team described in detail the extensive contact Trump’s team had with Russia during the election campaign and how Trump tried to impede the investigation, it stopped short of concluding he had committed a crime or that his aides had conspired with Moscow.

The team of personal lawyers was happy with the result. “No collusion and no obstruction,” Sekulow said, using a phrase often repeated by Trump.
Sorry to Bother You (2018)
Washington (CNN) If Robert Mueller wanted to charge President Donald Trump with obstruction, he found all he needed to do it.

And he found it on multiple fronts. But he didn't make a decision on whether to bring the case.

Mueller's report Thursday walked through excruciating detail of evidence in the obstruction of justice investigation and legal analysis, hitting over and over again how prosecutors had enough to meet the legal threshold for a case against Trump.

The special counsel examined multiple incidents for potential obstruction. It showed how Trump's actions crossed the threshold for a case when Trump confronted former FBI Director James Comey to "let" national security adviser Michael Flynn go; when Trump fired Comey; when Trump directed his former White House counsel Don McGahn to shut down Mueller; and when Trump tweeted about his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort's charges as he headed to trial.

In each of these situations, Mueller found evidence that Trump took steps to harm an investigation, had the ability to harm an investigation and had a personal motivation to harm the investigation.

The decision not to charge Trump with a crime means the President and his allies can claim a clean victory following the nearly two-year probe, but the evidence Mueller gathered and that Congress can still investigate suggests that conclusions about the President's actions could still come.

'Let Flynn go'

The first time Mueller explains a circumstance where Trump could have obstructed justice, he goes the distance.

Trump urged Comey to "let Flynn go" -- three times phrased differently in quick succession, Mueller notes -- and it was clear the President sought to end the FBI investigation into Flynn, Mueller wrote. That checked the box for the first part of the three-part legal test for obstruction.

In the second part of the legal test, Mueller got there as well, finding evidence that Trump realized Flynn could face criminal prosecution for lying at the time he had the conversation with Comey.

As for a personal stake in the investigation, the third part of Mueller's legal test, Mueller didn't find evidence that Flynn possessed information damaging to the President, leaving Trump's incentive for stopping the investigation not clear in that aspect. Yet Trump still had a personal stake in the investigation -- because he was motivated by how the Russia probe's findings could reflect on his electoral college election win.

Prosecutors heard from multiple witnesses that Trump "viewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election," Mueller wrote.

Mueller noted that he found Comey's retelling of events to the public to be truthful -- and not Trump's.

Firing Comey

Mueller also found evidence that firing Comey in May 2017, which prompted Mueller's appointment as special counsel, had the potential to hurt the investigation.

Trump at that time, like before, knew a prosecution of Flynn could be coming, and was motivated by Comey's unwillingness to publicly that say Trump wasn't under investigation.

In his legal analysis, Mueller fully refutes Trump's claim he had fired Comey for doing a bad job, specifically in how the FBI director handled the end of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email. That was not "supported by the evidence," Mueller wrote.

Some of the evidence "indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign," Mueller added.

Directing his lawyer

The Mueller team is quite clear on Trump's multiple orders to McGahn to rid him of Mueller. Trump met every legal test for obstruction in this situation, too, Mueller found.

"As with the President's firing of Comey, the attempt to remove the special counsel would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation" and the grand jury's work, the report states.

Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller fired -- a step that would clearly impede the special counsel's office work -- but McGahn wouldn't do it.

Like Comey, McGahn was a credible witness, while Trump was not, Mueller found.

"You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod," Trump told McGahn, and discussed "knocking out Mueller" on the phone with McGahn in a May 2017 call, the report said.

Finally, on Trump's intent, there was "substantial evidence" Mueller said he found about how the President wanted to fire Mueller because he was being investigated for obstruction.

Pressuring witnesses

Mueller also outlined how Trump attempted to put pressure on Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and another unnamed person, whose name is withheld because of an ongoing investigation, from giving information against him.

If Mueller had brought a case in this situation, the one regarding the President's public comments as Manafort went to trial that could have prejudiced a jury would have been strongest, according to the report.

Manafort was convicted by a jury on eight financial crimes unrelated to his work for Trump. He then pleaded guilty on additional charges related to his Ukrainian lobbying, and agreed to cooperate with investigators, before lying to them repeatedly.

"Evidence concerning the President's conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government," Mueller wrote.

"Some evidence supports a conclusion that the President intended, at least in part, to influence the jury," the report added, before acknowledging the President he may have felt genuinely bad for his former campaign chairman on trial.

Role of new Attorney General William Barr

Mueller's own words over the 182-page analysis of the obstruction investigation refute the attorney general's own statements that Mueller found "evidence on both sides of the question" and could not decide on "'difficult issues' of law and fact" in the obstruction question.

In all, the evidence in many circumstances Mueller looked at fell in favor of a case, and Mueller outlined his opinions in the report on the "difficult issues" that the Justice Department would have to resolve if Mueller had chosen to prosecute.

At times, Trump was motivated to obstruct the Russian investigation. At other times, Trump wanted to obstruct the obstruction of justice investigation Mueller was conducting into him.

The pieces were all there. Yet Mueller didn't act.

Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein chose not to charge the President with an obstruction crime.

"Although the deputy attorney general and I disagreed with some of the special counsel's legal theories, and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision," Barr said at a press conference Thursday morning.

"Instead, we accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis, and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusions," he added.

Prosecuting a sitting president and DOJ rules

That the evidence wasn't conclusive wasn't at the crux of Mueller's decision not to prosecute, according to his report. The special counsel, even if he had wanted to, couldn't prosecute a sitting president.

"This Office accepted (an internal Justice Department) legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction," Mueller wrote, citing the Office of Legal Counsel policy. Even setting OLC aside, Mueller added, "We recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct."

Separately, Mueller disagreed with Barr's previous assertion that the President as chief executive isn't capable of obstructing justice -- another important constitutional question when they looked at potential cases. Mueller also fully disagreed with legal defenses Trump's lawyers presented when trying to sway the special counsel against charging the President, the report noted.

So, would prosecutors have brought an obstruction case if Trump hadn't been President?

"Here's the problem," CNN analyst Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor said. "Yes, but they're not going to charge the President."

"It's a strong obstruction case."
A loophole in how to raise funds? !

China and Korea are paying attention.

Speaking of funding for cryptocurrency, I think that the majority imagine "ICO"!

However, another method is now popular in China and Korea!

In China and Korea, where ICO (Initial Coin Offering), which is fund raising using tokens, is prohibited, IEO (Initial Exchange Offering), which is another form of financing using tokens, is secretly popular I'm starting.

The research company Diar informed.

IEO is a type of financing that uses tokens, and unlike ICO, a mechanism that only users using an exchange can buy and sell.

It is expected that fraudulent tokens will be eliminated as exchanges perform preliminary screening of tokens.

China and Korea banned ICO in 2017.

However, according to Diar, the exchanges of the two countries have found a technical loophole at IEO.

It was reported that they were raising funds.

For example, Korea's Exchange ProBit launched its own funding platform in February this year, raising over $ 2 million through more than 20 IEOs.

China's BW.com also launched the IEO platform despite China's ban.

Diar pointed out that as a way of trading these exchanges, it has repeatedly raised small-scale funding multiple times.

According to anonymity of a Korean exchange official, "I don't know if this method will last, but I feel that the regulatory environment is better than before."

Recently, it was reported that several senior officials of the Korean government are considering changing the regulatory framework of digital currency including cryptocurrency.

This year, major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Fobi have launched their own IEO platform.

With the bear market continuing, IEO funding has been strong and token prices are also rising.

Because they are tokens that have passed the examination of the exchange, they are more reliable than ICO!

Mozilla has told BleepingComputer that they will be enabling the tracking feature called hyperlink auditing, or Pings, by default in Firefox. There is no timeline for when this feature will be enabled, but it will be done when their implementation is complete.

For those not familiar with hyperlink auditing, it is a HTML feature that allows web sites to track link clicks by adding the "ping=" attribute to HTML links. When these links are clicked, in addition to navigating to the linked to page, the browser will also connect to the page listed in the ping= attribute, which can then be used to record the click.

You can see an example of what a hyperlink auditing, or ping, HTML link looks like below. This would render a link to www.google.com, but would cause your browser to connect to www.bleepingcomputer.com/pong.php so that the click can be recorded.

Ping HTML Link

When these links are displayed on the page, they will appear as a normal link and if a user clicks on it, there is no indication that a connection is being made to a different page as well.

Privacy risk?

Earlier this month, we covered how Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Safari enabled hyperlink auditing pings by default. While some browsers currently enable you to disable this feature, all of the mentioned browsers will no longer allow users to do so in the future.

Flag in Chrome to disable hyperlink auditing

For some users, any tracking method, including hyperlink auditing, is seen a privacy risk and that they should always have the ability to disable it if they wish.

For this reason, when it was shown that Firefox and Brave do not enable this feature by default and did not appear to be doing so in the future, people praised the browser's decision.

Furthermore, a recent report has shown that hyperlink auditing pings have been used by attackers to perform DDoS attacks on web sites.

Mozilla feels it's a performance improvement

While some users feel this feature is a privacy risk, browsers developers feel that trackers are going to track, so you might as well offer a solution that provides better performance.

In a post by Apple, the WebKit developers explain that hyperlink auditing pings are a performance improvement because unlike other tracking methods, they do not block or delay the navigation to the requested site.

"Just turning off the Ping attribute or the Beacon API doesn’t solve the privacy implications of link click analytics. Instead, it creates an incentive for websites to adopt tracking techniques that hurt the user experience. In effect, the choice between supporting Ping and not is not one of privacy, rather it is a choice between a good user experience and a bad one."

After reading Apple's post, I contacted Mozilla to see if they agreed with the views expressed in the WebKit article.

Mozilla told BleepingComputer via email that they agreed with Apple's views on hyperlink auditing. Furthermore, they stated that the only reason it is not currently enabled by default in Firefox is because their implementation is not ready.

"We agree that enabling the hyperlink ping attribute that is commonly used for hyperlink auditing isn’t a question of privacy but a matter of improving the user experience by giving websites a better way to implement hyperlink auditing without the performance downsides of the other existing methods listed in the webkit.org blog post. In fact, we already support the sendBeacon API and the reason we don’t yet enable the hyperlink ping attribute is that our implementation of this feature isn’t yet complete."

When we asked if they felt that users should at least be given the ability to disable the feature if they wish, Mozilla stated that they did not believe it would have any "meaningful improvement" to a user's privacy.

"We don’t believe that offering an option to disable this feature alone will have any meaningful improvement in the user privacy, since website can (and often already do) detect the various supported mechanisms for hyperlink auditing in each browser and disabling the more user friendly mechanisms will cause them to fall back to the less user friendly ones, without actually disabling the hyperlink auditing functionality itself."

Brave states it will continue to block this feature

After Mozilla's response, we also contacted Brave Software to ask if they had any plans to enable hyperlink auditing in their browser.

"Disabling hyperlink auditing is a crucial privacy feature, and Brave has always disabled this by default," Catherine Corre, Head of Communications at Brave Software, told BleepingComputer via email. "Brave users expect this protection from our browser."

Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois reportedly got a stern telling off from US Speaker Nancy Pelosi during an awkward meeting about the Northern Ireland Border.

The Speaker of the US House of Representatives branded Mr Francois 'condescending' during a meeting with senior European Research Group (ERG) members.

Also at the meeting were Jacob Rees-Mogg , Sir Bernard Jenkin and Steve Baker.

According to the Times, the discussion took a turn when the ERG members played down the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland border.

Ms Pelosi was reportedly so offended by members of the group that she turned to Mr Francois and said: "Don't condescend to me or to us."

(Image: AFP/Getty Images)

A source who was in the room told the Times: "His face turned from already red to even brighter red.

"They were really condescending to the group, repeatedly saying the issue had been 'concocted' by Remainers, Brussels, and Leo Varadkar, and essentially that they were unwitting dupes."

Ms Pelosi is visiting the Northern Ireland border today as part of a week-long visit to the UK and Ireland.

(Image: PA)

Mr Francois said: "We had a good discussion with Speaker Pelosi and her delegation in which she kindly said twice, 'You guys have been the most consistent of anybody we have spoken to since we've been here'.

"However, a number of the delegation had clearly visited the province prior to 1998 and made constant references to a hard border, including some cases of barbed wire and watchtowers.

"We did our best to point out that no one was contemplating any such arrangement on the border including Leo Varadkar who has said himself that no such infrastructure would be necessary."
South Bend, Indiana Mayor and presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg opens up about his thoughts on the presidency, his marriage and more, in a wide-ranging interview with John Dickerson for "CBS Sunday Morning," to be broadcast April 21.

Buttigieg, 37, is a veteran of the Afghanistan war and is one of many vying for the Democratic nomination for president. If elected, he would be America's youngest president ever.

One of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. "Because the presidency is also a moral office," Buttigieg tells Dickerson, co-host of "CBS This Morning." "It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story."

In terms of experience for the job, Buttigieg says one of the toughest decisions he's had to make was a moment in Afghanistan when he needed to make a split-second decision whether to abandon a vehicle that might be ready to explode and risk being killed, or continue on with his mission.

Dickerson visits South Bend with Buttigieg to see his home, and the city he runs. Dickerson also talks with Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a junior-high schoolteacher.

"Do you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in American politics?" Dickerson asks Chasten Buttigieg.

"I think I'd argue I don't have to answer for it," Chasten replies. "I mean, we passed marriage equality. I don't think I have to answer for my marriage anymore. But I do enjoy going out there with Pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage."

Husband after Pete Buttigieg first shared presidential aspirations: "For real?"

"Sunday Morning," hosted by Jane Pauley, broadcasts on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET. Executive producer is Rand Morrison. "Sunday Morning" also streams on CBSN beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET and repeated at 1 p.m. ET, and is available on cbs.com, CBS All Access, and On Demand.

The Global Wealth Report 2018



The ninth edition of the Global Wealth Report published by the Credit Suisse Research Institute provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date source of information available on global household wealth. During the twelve months to mid-2018, aggregate global wealth rose by $14.0 trillion (4.6%) to a combined total of $317 trillion, outpacing population growth. Wealth per adult grew by 3.2%, raising global mean wealth to a record high of $63,100 per adult. The US contributed most to global wealth adding $6.3 trillion and taking its total to $98 trillion. This continues its unbroken run of growth in both total wealth and wealth per adult every year since 2008. Unsurprisingly, China is now clearly established in second place of the world wealth hierarchy. The country overtook Japan with respect to the number of ultra-high net worth (UHNW) individuals in 2009, total wealth in 2011 and the number of millionaires in 2014.

This year's report also provides new insights on female wealth holdings. Women now account for an estimated 40% of global wealth overall and their share of wealth has grown considerably throughout the 20th century. The report explores global variations in female wealth accumulation, along with differences in portfolio composition, risk aversion and the impact on female Millennials.
Robert Mueller’s Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election is best read as a work of literary nonfiction. While it lacks the frisson of the Starr Report and the attention to storytelling of the 9/11 Report, it is by far the most historically significant work of the Trump era. The second volume of the report, which documents Trump’s obstruction of the investigation, is deservedly receiving an enormous amount of attention because it raises questions about whether Trump committed crimes. But here I’ll focus on Volume I, which will likely stand as the most comprehensive account of what the Russians did in 2016—the closest thing we’ll get to a 9/11 Commission-style report of an attack on our country that our current president and his top aides, as Mueller shows, abetted even if they didn’t collude.

The Mueller report’s attention to detail, vacuumed out of iPhones and cloud accounts and hundreds of interviews conducted under threat of criminal charges by dozens of prosecutors and FBI agents, is extraordinary. It has become a cliche to say that Mueller knows all, but at least on this topic, he really does. He knew from cell phone location data that Erik Prince was in Trump Tower at the moment he opened a specific email. He knew Paul Manafort was lying about his relationship with a Russian asset because he’d already accessed the person’s electronic communications. He knew that on the evening of Trump’s victory a wealthy Russian, Kirill Dmitriev, who was trying to make inroads with the Trump administration, received a message from someone that said simply, “Putin has won.”

Unlike Bob Woodward’s Fear, everyone in Mueller’s magnum opus is on the record.

Unlike Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury, which largely channelled the insights of Steve Bannon, Mueller’s definitive account of the 2016 Russian interference campaign does not overly rely on access to a few sources. Unlike Bob Woodward’s Fear, everyone in Mueller’s magnum opus is on the record. Unlike the daily news coverage that documented many of the same events covered by Mueller, the narrator here guides the reader through the thicket of lies told by Trump aides by addressing a source’s reliability upfront.

For instance Manafort, the former campaign chairman and senior strategist to Trump, who in Mueller’s hands manages to come off as even more of a cartoon villain than he did during his criminal trial, is such a grand liar that Mueller developed a guide for readers to understand how information from Manfort is used in the report. Manafort’s versions of events are only allowed when “sufficiently corroborated,” when his lies themselves are crucial evidence, or in a few cases when Mueller couldn’t get to the bottom of something but deemed it worthwhile to convey Manfort’s side of the story.

This sort of exacting attention to source credibility makes the entire work feel definitive. Mueller is never satisfied with the kind of he said/she said accounts that by necessity we journalists often have to resort to. (We can’t subpoena anyone!) In most cases he settles factual disputes between conflicting sources. (This has a devastating effect in Volume II, which documents Trump’s efforts to obstruct the investigation, when Trump repeatedly contradicts James Comey’s version of events, only to be swatted down as a liar by Mueller, who cites corroborating evidence from notes and other witnesses to back up Comey. Now wonder in a Friday morning tweet attacking the "Crazy Mueller Report," Trump advised followers, "Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes.'")

In the rare instances when Mueller couldn’t referee competing versions of the truth he lets the reader know. One example that stood out: unless it is in a redacted portion, Mueller did not establish for certain that Julian Assange knew that Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, the two entities that sent him thousands of stolen Democratic emails, were internet personas created by the Russian intelligence unit that hacked data from the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.

The characters presented in the Mueller report are familiar but they are more vivid than ever, not because of any writerly flair—the prose is wooden—but because of Mueller’s attention to detail. Many of the ridiculous early Trumpa-era personalities get their own section in Mueller’s account of the Russian interference campaign, and they often come across as too bumbling or inept to collude with a brunch menu, let alone Russian intelligence.

Google is a constant challenge for them. When George Papadopoulos meets one Russian contact, Olga Polonskaya, in London on March 24, 2016, he erroneously believes that she is Putin’s daughter. The degree to which Mueller shows receipts about even minor facts like this is extraordinary. He footnotes Papadopoulos’s mistake with a reference to the young man’s internet search history “revealing late-morning and early-afternoon searches on March 24, 2016 for ‘Putin’s niece,’ ‘olga putin,’ and ‘russian president niece olga,’ among other terms.” (Always erase your search history before meeting possible Russian spies!)

Michael Cohen was similarly flummoxed by Google. Mueller documents the long and detailed efforts that Cohen undertook on behalf of Trump to build a Trump Tower Moscow, a project that continued through the middle of the 2016 campaign, despite Cohen and Trump’s repeated denials that Trump had any financial interests in Russia. The Russian side of the deal went through different permutations and at one point Ivanka Trump connected Cohen with Dmitry Klokov, a former Russian official who offered Cohen assistance on both the building project and Trump’s presidential campaign—“political synergy,” he called it—and dangled a meeting with Putin. Cohen’s due diligence process to vet Klokov consisted of googling his name. He came to believe--erroneously--that Klokov was a former Russian Olympic weightlifter. They communicated by email and over the phone for two days and Cohen never realized Klokov was actually someone else.

Many Trumpers come across as too bumbling or inept to collude with a brunch menu, let alone Russian intelligence. Google is a constant challenge.

As late as last summer, when he was being interviewed by Mueller’s team, Cohen was still talking about his weightlifter contact in Russian. “During his interviews with the Office, Cohen still appeared to believe that the Klokov he spoke with was that Olympian,” Mueller notes in a deadpan style he seems to reserve for these comical moments. ”The investigation, however, established that the email address used to communicate with Cohen belongs to a different Dmitry Klokov.”

Properly communicating with Russians was a constant problem for Cohen. When he tried to reinvigorate the stalled Moscow Tower project in December 2015 he reached out to Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, but initially used an email address that was off by one letter.

Manafort may be the exception to this kind of ineptitude. He comes across as a Soprano-like criminal who has spent so much of his recent years in Ukraine electing politicians and then cashing in on access that he thought nothing of trying the same grift with Trump. The twist is that he was in debt to a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. and crafted a role for himself in Trump’s orbit that was designed to appease Deripaska. Mueller reports that Manafort repeatedly sent internal Trump campaign polling to his old business partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, who, we are informed, the FBI ”assesses” has ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik’s ties to Russia were sufficiently well-known that Manafort’s longtime business partner, Rick Gates, who was also the deputy campaign chairman for Trump, once joked that Kilimnik was “going to meet his Russian handler.” Manafort regularly followed up with emails to ascertain from Kilimnik as to whether Deripaska, with whom Kilimnik allegedly shared the polling data, was sufficiently impressed with Manafort’s new role to forget about all that money he owed him.

Manafort’s master plan was to elect Trump and reunite with a more forgiving Deripaska so they could both cash in on access to the White House. So what if one of the strings attached was helping Putin take full control of eastern Ukraine through a new puppet government endorsed by Trump and run by Manafort’s old client, Viktor Yanukovych? (Yes, this is all in the report.) Still Mueller found no evidence that Manafort had any connection to Russia’s election-interference efforts.

One of the most interesting new characters uncovered by Mueller is Petr Aven, a bonafide Russian oligarch. After pages and pages of only dimly seeing the Russian side of the story, Aven’s emergence on page 146, after Trump has been elected with Putin’s help, is a reader delight. By that point in the narrative one of the few clear weaknesses of the investigation is Mueller’s seeming inability to have penetrated Putin’s small circle. And then out of nowhere Mueller casually pops this surprise:

“As Russian officials in the United States reached out to the President-Elect and his team, a number of Russian individuals working in the private sector began their own efforts to make contact. Petr Aven, a Russian national who heads Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest commercial bank, described to the Office interactions with Putin during this time period that might account for the flurry of Russian activity. Aven told the Office that he is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin; these 50 men are often referred to as ‘oligarchs.’”

What?! Mueller got one of Putin’s oligarchs to spill some tea on what life as an oligarch is like when your boss, the murdering tyrant of Russia, is trying to influence the American President he just helped elect? Why, yes, he did.

Manafort’s master plan was to elect Trump and reunite with Deripaska so they could both cash in on access to the White House.

Aven does not disappoint. We learn through him that the oligarchs meet quarterly and that in December 2016, Putin hosted an “all-hands” oligarch meeting—yes, that’s apparently a real thing—to warn Aven and his colleagues that the Obama administration would retaliate for the interference campaign with new sanctions and that the Oligarchs should protect themselves by reaching out to Trump world. The diktat helps explain a renewed offensive from various Russian businessmen to penetrate the Trump world after his victory, all of which is exhaustively detailed by Mueller.

Aven also makes it clear that the American media’s view of Putin’s capabilities can be exaggerated. Putin, far from having unfettered access to Trump, found it difficult to know who to talk to in Trump’s world. Just passing on a congratulatory message was stymied by poor lines of communication. Hope Hicks, Trump’s top communications aide got a message from the Russian embassy when Trump won, but she was unsure it was legit, so she forwarded the email to Kushner. “Can you look into this?” she wrote. ”Don’t want to get duped but don’t want to blow off Putin!"

Sadly, the Aven character fades from the drama after his Q1 2017 oligarch meeting, though not before delivering a succinct view of how concerned Putin’s orbit was about the Russia investigation. Aven told Mueller’s team that at that early 2017 oligarch confab he informed Putin’s chief of staff that he was talking to the FBI about his attempts to create a backchannel to the new Trump administration. “According to Aven,” Mueller writes, ”the official showed no emotion in response to this report and did not appear to care.”

One of the strengths of the report is Mueller’s ability to distinguish between potentially troubling episodes—he seems highly alarmed by Manafort’s links to Ukraine and Russia—and those that may have looked awful but have innocent explanations. Kushner, who has often been caught up in the media’s Russian collusion drama, comes off as more naive than sinister in his dealings with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. Mueller dryly retells the story of Kushner suggesting that Kushner and Kislyak use the Russian embassy to securely communicate with some generals that the ambassador suggested could brief him on Syria, but there’s no inference that Kushner was plotting something nefarious. However the Kushner-Kislyak bromance does take a sad turn when Kushner is informed that there’s a more important Russian official with closer ties to Putin who he should be communicating with and Kushner stops returning Kislyak’s messages. (Even sadder: he makes his assistant meet with the still-persistent ambassador.)

Mueller also didn’t find anything particularly alarming about Sessions meeting with Kislyak in his Senate office and did not think Sessions perjured himself when he failed to disclose the meeting in his Senate confirmation hearing. Mueller confirms that a Trump staffer did indeed alter the language of the Republican Party platform to make it less hostile to Russia, but he didn’t find a Russian plot behind the change.

Mueller considered charging Don Jr. and others with a campaign finance violation for agreeing to accept opposition research from a Russian contact but found--wisely it seems--that the law against campaigns accepting something of value from a foreigner was too murky to apply to the unusual case. (Congress would be wise to step in and craft some tighter rules against foreign assistance.)

The one mystery not resolved by the redacted version of the report is the full extent of Roger Stone’s dealings with Wikileaks.

Mueller also clears up some of the conspiracy theories. The description of Carter Page’s links to Russian intelligence and his actions in 2016 offer plenty of fodder for defending the surveillance—“spying” in Attorney General Barr’s words—that was conducted against him by the government when fears about Russian meddling and the Trump campaign were at their height. Though it has been often disputed by some critics of the investigation, Mueller documents carefully that the probe was indeed opened after a foreign government tipped off the FBI that Papadopoulos had claimed to know about the Russian email hacking in advance, and not because of the Steele dossier (which gets very little attention in the report). Mueller even chases down and refutes a rumor that Trump may have been at a chess tournament in New York to secretly meet with a Russian businessman in late 2016.

The one mystery not resolved by the redacted version of the report is the full extent of Roger Stone’s dealings with Wikileaks. Most of the Stone material is blacked out because his trial hasn’t started yet and the Justice Department determined the information could harm the case. One section that covers declinations—decisions not to indict—tantalizingly appears to be about Stone and collusion. So we will have to wait a little longer for the entire Trump-Russia story to emerge.

But by the end of the first volume I was exhausted by the amount of detail and the comprehensiveness of the investigation. I also realized that after I finished it that we are right back where we started: Putin interfered in a dramatic fashion in the 2016 election and Trump encouraged it, benefited from it, and then tried to cover it up, even though he wasn’t a criminal partner in the conspiracy. We got attacked in 2016, and the real crime is what was legal: the person who got elected just didn’t care.

Lately, Donald Trump fans have enjoyed attacking left-leaning Americans. Last year, for instance, Miami-area resident Cesar Sayoc sent pipe bombs to prominent liberals across the nation and went to jail. Today another South Florida man was arrested, this time for allegedly threatening to kill four Democrats.

Federal authorities today announced that John Kless, a 49-year-old resident of Tamarac in Broward County, called three Democrats at their Washington, D.C. offices April 16 and left voicemail messages threatening murder. The lawmakers included California Congressman Eric Swalwell, Detroit Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

In all three messages, Kless referenced his hatred for Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar — repeatedly calling her a "towel head" and a member of the Taliban. In his message to Tlaib's office, Kless referenced Omar's recent "some people did something" comments about 9/11 — a statement Omar made to argue that all Muslims should not be punished for the actions of the few who committed the attacks. But conservatives have taken Omar's comments entirely out of context to falsely argue that Omar was diminishing the impact or tragedy of 9/11.

"It was your Taliban bitch, the one who opened up her fucking towel-head mouth about how 'some people did it,'" Kless allegedly said in his message to Tlaib. "You know what? She's lucky she's just getting death threats, bitch. So are you. All right? You're lucky they're just threats, motherfucker, 'cause the day when the bell tolls, whore, and this country comes to a war, there will be no more threats. Your life will be on the fucking line."

Kless allegedly continued to say the following:

No one wants to fucking hear you or that other little whore. I'd like to take that bitch and throw her right off the Empire State Building, that fucking whore. Tell her to shut her fucking mouth. You fucking fuck her all the time probably. So tell her to shut the fuck up, all right? From one towel head to another. You stanking, fucking, smelly, fucking bitch. Fuck off. I wish all of you the worst. You can go fuck off in life. Fuck you, and fuck Mohammed too, you bitch fucking cunt.



Kless also allegedly criticized Swalwell's stance on gun control. Kless reportedly said if Swalwell enacted gun-safety laws, someone would kill the lawmaker. He also called Swalwell a communist and, oddly, the N-word. (Swalwell is white.)

"The day you come after our guns, motherfucker, is the day you'll be dead," Kless said, according to a federal indictment. He added, "You're gonna die. Don't wanna do that shit, boy. You'll be [on] your deathbed, motherfucker, along with the rest of you Democrats. So if you want death, keep that shit up, motherfucker."

Swalwell this afternoon thanked the Capitol Police and Florida law-enforcement officials for apprehending Kless:

Thank you to the @CapitolPolice and Florida law enforcement for protecting my staff and constituents. https://t.co/qOuVcbnDJ8 — Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) April 19, 2019

Kless repeatedly used the N-word to refer to Booker and called him a "monkey," according to court records, adding he wanted to kill black men like the senator. "You're a fucking disgrace," Kless allegedly said. "We need to kill all you motherfuckers, man, every fucking one of you, man." He added that the terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia — in which a white supremacist drove a car into progressive protester Heather Heyer — killed only "one fucking person." He then said Booker should tell his "colleague with the towel on her head to shut up about 9/11."

"You're going to be the motherfuckers that pay," Kless allegedly told Booker. "Don't worry — you government officials will be in the graves where you belong." (Booker and Swalwell are both running for president in 2020.)

In two of the three voicemail messages, Kless defended Trump and told lawmakers to stop criticizing him. After running Kless' name and phone number, federal investigators learned he had previously left "profane/harassing" messages at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office.

Kless has been charged with making threatening communications, a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Kless is the second man this month arrested for threatening Omar: On April 4, an upstate New York man, Patrick W. Carlineo Jr., was arrested for threatening to shoot the congresswoman.

In response, Wilfredo Ruiz, a spokesperson for the Florida chapter of the Council of American-Islamic Relations, a civil-rights organization, said in a media release that Donald Trump's rhetoric is, indeed, sparking violence against Muslims. CAIR is also asking the federal government to charge Kless with hate-crimes.

"This outrageous, Islamophobic, criminal conduct needs to be forcefully prosecuted to the utmost extent,” Ruiz said. “The inflammatory and racist rhetoric originated by our President and several hate groups active across America have repercussions.”




A fourth measles case is now confirmed in Maryland.

The case also originated from the Pikesville area.

Measles Cases Prompts Travel Concerns As Passover, Easter Holidays Approach

The Maryland Department of Health wants to inform anyone who visited 4000 Old Court Rd in Pikesville on Tuesday, April 16 from 9:15 a.m. till 12:30 p.m. that they may have been exposed to measles. Individuals who may have been exposed at additional locations are being notified directly.

Measles cases in Maryland have been localized to a small geographic area within zip codes 21208, 21209 and 21215.

The first two cases were within a family, however, a third case was not from someone within the same home.

The exposures also include two grocery store locations in Pikesville:

Market Maven (1630 Reisterstown Rd, Pikesville) on Sunday, April 14 from 11:45 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.

Seven Mile Market (201 Reisterstown Rd, Pikesville) on Sunday, April 14 from 12:45 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.

“While the outbreak is currently localized to a small area of the state, the best way to prevent measles in Maryland, or anywhere people might travel, is through vaccination,” said Deputy Secretary for Public Health Frances B. Phillips, RN, MHA. “We continue to encourage all Marylanders to get vaccinated or check with their health care providers to ensure they and their families are up-to-date on vaccinations.”

If you’re healthy and are already vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccination, no further action is needed.

However, if you have a weakened immune system but are vaccinated, you should still call your doctor and tell them you may have been exposed.

MDH also suggests the following to people who think they may have been exposed:

If you know you have NOT received two doses of MMR vaccine, or if you aren’t sure whether or not you have received two doses of MMR vaccine, call your health care provider right away to determine next steps since you might need a dose of MMR vaccine or a medication called immune globulin

received two doses of MMR vaccine, or if you aren’t sure whether or not you have received two doses of MMR vaccine, call your health care provider right away to determine next steps since you might need a dose of MMR vaccine or a medication called immune globulin Monitor for possible symptoms of measles, such as fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and rash, and call your health care provider before visiting their office so they can make special arrangements to evaluate you, if needed, without putting other patients and medical office staff at risk

Far from the turmoil of new Facebook data breaches and APT threats, hackers are fighting for Julian Assange or maybe just attention.

Look up #OpAssange, #OpUK, #OpEcuador and you will find DDoS, hacks, alleged hacks, small leaks, and big ambitions.

Some of the attacks are targeting small sites with lousy security that didn’t do anything wrong other than have an Ecuador domain.

Accordingly to @your_anon_net, this is a severe leak.

https://ghostbin.com/paste/wx8rh

Hacking the agricultural university of Ecuador is for sure not something of significant concern for the Ecuadorian government.

Another targeted school was Ecuador’s School of the Judicial Function website https://escuela.funcionjudicial.gob.ec/ .

Yet the full list of attacked Ecuador sites sites is quite long and it comprehends many Ecuadorian Consulates, public and private institutions.

The government of Ecuador disclosed that they have been attacked more than 40 million times since the arrest of Assange, but again the true extent and forms of those attacks were not disclosed in more details.

But not only Ecuador is the target, as the UK is also on the list.



Allegedly websites like the National archive or the national crime agency went down, yet if they even were unavailable than for a short amount of time or it never happened. But at the same time I could verify that police.uk was down for a longer period of time.

Accordingly to isitdownrightnow.com The NAtional Archive wasn’t affected or for a very short period of time

Police.uk was taken down

Who is behind those attacks?



At #OpUK, the operation to disrupt the United Kingdom, that the most prominent group is called @Pryzraky that formed by different Hackers. In this case, @Mecz1nho and @al1ne3737 are the ones that claim most of the attacks.

In addition to that two anonymous groups are taking part in the operation called @your_anon_net and @An0nym0us_Esp.

Although @Pryzraky group member claim that many of their hacks are being stolen by new Anonymous groups.

#FreeAssange #OpEcuador



I hate when I have the job of gathering information and vulnerabilities from Ecuadorian Government websites and posting on my twitter, to come to "anonymous" and steal all my publications and use for their own benefit without giving the proper credits. — al1ne3737 (@al1ne3737) April 17, 2019



Also, @CyberGhost404 seems to have joined the efforts. This Hacker is also part of another hacker collective called Philippines Cyber Eagles.

At #OpEcuador @your_anon_net is again active in the movement, together with @ArksKaiser, @cyb3rc0v3nsec and @Karamujo18.

Most of the attacks are DDoS, SQL Injections, and few data leaks.

Netscout has a live Cyber Threat horizon DDoS map.

Although such maps are only an indication of such traffic and should always be taken with a pinch of salt, it is interesting to compare the attacks of #OpEcuador in time.

The arrest of Julian Assange was on the 12 of April, and you can see a clear indication of DDoS to the country, the time #OpEcuador was in effect.



Netscout Cyber Threat horizon 14 of April 2019

One month before you have similar if not higher traffic.

Netscout Cyber Threat horizon 13 of March 2019



In comparison, December 7, 2018, had much lower traffic.



Netscout Cyber Threat horizon 11 of December 2018

Netscout also has summary reports, and if you look into the statistics it looks like the March attacks had higher frequency and volumes than April.

The question is, who was attacking Equador before? Was it Nation State Hacking Groups? Did they have or wanted to gather intelligence on the arrest of Julian Assange before it happened?

It is a possibility that could not be verified.

Amazon and Google announce free Amazon Music and YouTube Music streaming for Alexa and Google Home devices respectively

Amazon and Google are feeling friendly this week. Just days after finally settling their streaming device feud, the companies are offering free versions of their music services for smart speakers. Amazon Music can be used for free on Alexa devices and YouTube Music can be used for free on Google Home devices.

Both companies are doing essentially the same thing. Amazon Music can be used for free with ads, sort of like Pandora. You simply ask for something like “play 80s music” and it will find a matching station. If you already have Amazon Prime you get Amazon Music Unlimited, which doesn’t have ads.

YouTube Music also now has a free, ad-supported version for Google Home devices. Similarly to Amazon’s feature, you can give a command like “play Latin vibes” and YouTube will find a station. This is basically the same as how Google Play Music’s free tier currently works. You can’t ask for specific albums or songs on either Amazon Music or YouTube Music’s free offering.

Amazon Music’s free tier is available to users in the US. YouTube Music’s free tier is available in the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, and Austria. This is a great option for those who don’t need a premium music service.

Fernando Llorente shooting from the hip is what football needs right now

Trending

Share







Fernando Llorente’s Champions League performance had everything: a flukey goal, a striker’s tackle and a reserve grabbing his chance. More, please.

Tottenham Hotspur are in the semi-finals of the Champions League because Fernando Llorente, a 34-year-old striker, this week eliminated Manchester City with what was only his second ever goal in the knockout stages of the competition.

To score it, he used body parts that weren’t feet or a head.

The debate will rage on, boringly, about whether the goal should have stood. At this moment, social media is saturated with slow-motion replays of the Spaniard’s rippling forearm.

At the same time, big (ish) questions are being asked. Why didn’t VAR use this angle? How was the movement unintentional if Bernardo Silva’s touch was deliberate? Has VAR made football better or worse?

Maybe those questions are valid; maybe they aren’t. That’s Man City’s business, but for the rest of us there are more important things to focus on.

Important things like how Llorente, who has occasionally been found knocking on the door of the Soldado-Janssen club of cursed Spurs strikers, has become an instant cult hero. Like how an ageing reserve player has stolen the headlines in the absence of one of the world’s best strikers. Like how a perilously slow striker briefly ended up at left-back.

VAR may have been Wednesday’s key player, but by scoring Tottenham’s winning goal, the big and blue-eyed Llorente has shown how absolutely anyone can be a hero in this season’s weird and wonderful Champions League.

For that and more, he’s done the game a huge service.

A great goal for great times

First and foremost, it should be noted that Llorente’s carefully placed body-goal is, without the doubt, the best strike of the 2018-19 Champions League.

It is the Gareth Bale overhead kick of this year’s edition. The Zidane volley of Tottenham’s European adventure. It is a goal that Harry Kane will wish he had scored with his own large quadriceps.

Not that it was beautiful in the traditional sense. A long-range wondergoal this was not. Skill and guile Llorente did not demonstrate.

No, the year’s most high-profile thigh-in was something else: the perfect distillation of an end-to-end ‘seven-goal thriller’ in which very little made sense; a perfect snapshot of football in the era of video assistant refereeing.

The Llorente goal was brilliant because it showed how, even with the slow-motion replay rolling back and forth dozens of times in front of referee Cuneyt Cakir, this technologically augmented version of football ultimately remained football as it always had been: random, marginal, hard to see in black and white.

Even your boys on Twitter, knee deep in Windows Movie Maker and zooming in on Llorente’s undulating bicep, couldn’t prove whether this was a handball or not.

That Cakir finally confirmed the validity of the goal with a gesture that can only be described as an ‘irritated shrug’ was brilliant in itself, a glorious moment worth a million topless Ronaldo poses.

Llorente, without doubt, has scored the Champions League goal of the season.

Hard to explain

That being said, Llorente’s controversial winning goal wasn’t even his best contribution of the match. Peak Llorente, peak madness, peak football came 18 minutes prior, when the Spaniard — for reasons not yet known — ended up in the left wing-back position.

Even more than his thigh goal, Llorente’s brave covering of the far touchline, while Danny Rose was back alongside his centre-backs, truly demonstrated the backs-to-the-wall graft of Tottenham and, more importantly, the overall nonsense of the tie.

In his only contribution from that position on the field, the cumbersome six-foot-four striker had a go — a very fair go — at tackling the five-foot-eight Bernardo Silva, one of the most skilful players on the pitch.

It went more or less how you’d expect.

This admirable positional adventure, a move that culminated in a foul that nearly led to a headed goal from David Silva (yet more nonsense), basically tore up the rulebook. If things like this can happen, can’t Spurs win the bloody thing?

Note, please, how Llorente shoots and tackles with his thigh.

At the end of the day, regardless of whether Tottenham can progress further in the competition, that brilliant quarter-final and Llorente’s role in it provided unquestionable proof that:

Anything can happen

Anyone can make it happen

Any body parts can be used by anyone to make it happen

The game-changing contribution from the rarely scoring, sparingly used Spaniard should have you on your toes for the semi-finals, for the final, for the rest of footballing eternity in which referees — fingers poked into ears, eyes glued to the screen — are really just as helpless as they always have been, and in which the least likely substitutes will emerge as the most feted heroes.

Be on your toes — or your thighs.

In the immediate aftermath of the horrific attacks at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, internet companies faced intense scrutiny over their efforts to control the proliferation of the shooter's propaganda. Responding to many questions about the speed of their reaction and the continued availability of the shooting video, several companies published posts or gave interviews that revealed new information about their content moderation efforts and capacity to respond to such a high-profile incident.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Emma Llansó is Director of Free Expression at the Center for Democracy & Technology.

This kind of transparency and information sharing from these companies is a positive development. If we're going to have coherent discussions about the future of our information environment, we—the public, policymakers, the media, website operators—need to understand the technical realities and policy dynamics that shaped the response to the Christchurch massacre. But some of these responses have also included ideas that point in a disturbing direction: toward increasingly centralized and opaque censorship of the global internet.

Facebook, for example, describes plans for an expanded role for the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, or GIFCT. The GIFCT is an industry-led self-regulatory effort launched in 2017 by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube. One of its flagship projects is a shared database of hashes of files identified by the participating companies to be “extreme and egregious” terrorist content. The hash database allows participating companies (which include giants like YouTube and one-man operations like JustPasteIt) to automatically identify when a user is trying to upload content already in the database.

In Facebook's post-Christchurch updates, the company discloses that it added 800 new hashes to the database, all related to the Christchurch video. It also mentions that the GIFCT is "experimenting with sharing URLs systematically rather than just content hashes"—that is, creating a centralized (black)list of URLs that would facilitate widespread blocking of videos, accounts, and potentially entire websites or forums.

Microsoft president Brad Smith also calls for building on the GIFCT in a recent post, urging industry-wide action. He suggests a "joint virtual command center" that would enable tech companies to coordinate during major events and decide what content to block and what content is in "the public interest." (There has been considerable debate among journalists and media organizations about how to cover the Christchurch event in the public interest. Smith does not explain how tech companies would be better able to reach a consensus view, but unilateral decisions on that point, made from a corporate and US-based perspective, will likely not satisfy a global user base.)

One major problem with expanding the hash database is that the initiative has long-standing transparency and accountability deficits. No one outside of the consortium of companies knows what is in the database. There are no established mechanisms for an independent audit of the content, or an appeal process for removing content from the database. People whose posts are removed or accounts disabled on participating sites aren't even notified if the hash database was involved. So there's no way to know, from the outside, whether content has been added inappropriately and no way to remedy the situation if it has.

The risk of overbroad censorship from automated filtering tools has been clear since the earliest days of the internet, and the hash database is undoubtedly vulnerable to the same risks. We know that content moderation aimed at terrorist propaganda can sweep in news reporting, political protest, documentary footage, and more. The GIFCT does not require members to automatically remove content that appears in the database, but in practice, smaller platforms do not have the resources to do nuanced human analysis of large volumes of content and will tend to streamline moderation where they can. Indeed, even YouTube was overwhelmed by a one-video-per-second upload rate. In the days after the shooting, it circumvented its own human-review processes to take videos down en masse.

The post-Christchurch push for centralizing censorship goes well beyond the GIFCT hash database. Smith raises the specter of browser-based filters that would prohibit users from accessing or downloading forbidden content; if these in-browser filters are mandatory or turned on by default, this pushes content control a level deeper into the web. Three ISPs in Australia took the blunt step of blocking websites that hosted the shooting video until those sites removed the copies. While the ISPs acknowledged that this was an extraordinary circumstance, this decision was a stark reminder of the power of internet providers to exercise ultimate control over what users can access and post.

When policymakers and industry leaders talk about how to manage insidious content that takes advantage of virality for horrific aims, their focus typically falls on how to ensure that content removal is swift and comprehensive. But proposals for quick and widespread takedown, with no safeguards or even discussion of the risks of overbroad censorship, are incomplete and irresponsible. Self-regulatory initiatives like the GIFCT function not only to address a particular policy issue, but also to stave off more sweeping government regulation. We've already seen governments, including the European Union, look to co-opt the hash database and transform it from a voluntary initiative into a legislative mandate, without meaningful safeguards for protected speech. Any self-regulatory effort will face this same problem. Safeguards against censorship must be an integral part of any proposed solution.

Beyond that, though, there's a fundamental threat posed by solutions that rely on centralizing content control: The strength of the internet for fostering free expression lies in its decentralized nature, which can support a diversity of platforms. This decentralization allows some sites to focus on providing an experience that feels safe, or entertaining, or suitable for kids, while others aim to foster debate, or create an objective encyclopedia, or maintain an archive of videos documenting war crimes. Each of these is a distinct and laudable goal, but each requires different content standards and moderation practices. As we debate where to go after Christchurch, we must be wary of one-size-fits-all solutions and work to preserve the diversity of an open internet.

YouTube has turned to one of its homegrown stars — technology vlogger Marques Brownlee, aka “MKBHD” — for its newest original series.

The video platform has greenlit series “Retro Tech” featuring Brownlee, in which he’ll unbox and review vintage technology products that have defined pop culture. The show, slated to debut in December 2019, follows an original special of the same name that premiered Friday, in which he plays with and details the history of the iconic Nintendo Game Boy, first introduced in 1989. (Watch below or at this link.)

The series six-episode unscripted series is slated to debut on Brownlee’s YouTube channel in December 2019. The show, produced by Vox Media Studios and YouTube, is based on his popular “Dope Tech” segment. The series will guest star YouTube creators, educators and inventors.

“Retro Tech” will be available on a free, ad-supported basis, whereas some YouTube originals are available only through the YouTube Premium subscription service. In the past few months, YouTube has canceled several scripted shows (but it’s retaining a few tentpoles, like “Cobra Kai”) with a programming slate focused on music, education, and YouTube creators like Brownlee.

Brownlee, 25, has been uploading videos to YouTube since he was 14 from his parents’ house in the New York suburb of Maplewood, N.J. His channel was previously called “MKBHD” before he changed it to his name. Today he’s one of the largest tech-focused creators on the platform with 8.3 millions subscribers and over 1.3 billion views across his channel. Recent top videos include “Talking Tech with Elon Musk” (4.9 million views) and “Google Pixel 3 Impressions” (3.5 million views).

For their first year and a half making music as a duo, David Singer-Vine and Lisa Vitale hid their identities — covering their faces with their hands in photographs, not doing interviews; for a long while, there was a theory circling the Internet that this enigmatic group had Kylie Jenner as its lead singer, after their song “Three Strikes” was featured in her “Glosses” video commercial. While Jenner’s involvement was debunked, it did serve to raise the duo’s profile. From 2015 to 2018, they released three separate LP-length projects, each called “Bop City,” a mysterious, made-up place with an album cover that revealed little else than the color purple and clusters of grapes.

But here they are, on a recent Thursday, performing at the Warsaw concert venue in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint neighborhood as part of their headlining tour — and they’ve got a meet-and-greet planned. They’ve just released their first full-length album, “Unfortunately,” and have adopted a newfound approach to being Terror Jr. They’re stepping into the light, making themselves known and shaking hands with the fans who stayed with them through all the riddles, secrets and dead-end clues to who they really were posted on social media for three years.

“For the first tour that we did in 2017, I wore a cape,” Vitale explains from their green room at the venue. “It was kind of protection for me, because I was not sure how people would respond to seeing me when we had kept that so separate from the group. Even on that tour, we kept everything very moody, you couldn’t fully see my face, it was still very mysterious. We were trying to keep people guessing.

“On this tour, the nerves of wondering how people would react to finding out who I was have dissipated because the fans that are around now support us as we are, with both of our faces out there.”

Vitale is a small 28-year-old with purple streaks in her hair, a toothy smile and tiny, slender hands. She hails from the Metro Detroit area — a town called Sterling Heights that she jokes has been nicknamed “Sterling Whites” for its primarily Caucasian demographic. Singer-Vine, a long-haired guy from Berkeley, Calif., who has a joke just goofy enough to be hilarious lined up at every moment, has worked in music for more than 10 years. Under the moniker Campa, he made music with the pop-rap group The Cataracs alongside Niles Hollowell-Dhar, who now DJs with the stage name Kshmr (Singer-Vine wrote their number-one hit, “Like a G6″). But with Terror Jr., Singer-Vine and Vitale have the chance to write pop songs that send more serious messages. Music publications have labeled Terror Jr.’s music — which contain song lyrics like “white women voted for Trump” — as political. But Vitale insists it isn’t limited to just that.

“It makes me imagine something different than what we are,” she says. “I actually prefer when people say ‘sugary pop group’ and then they’re sort of surprised by the lyrics. If they’re drawn to the sound and the music first, then they slowly realize that we are entering their minds with these other messages strewn in there. I like when people approach it that way. They’re drawn in by the pop and then maybe they stay because of the underlying message.”

The fans, which are cult-like in their love for Terror Jr., do feel a sense of connection to the band. Singer-Vine and Vitale say they’ve noticed this during their live shows and at the meet-and-greets.

“We’re always at a loss for words because we just can’t believe they want to meet us — because we’re like, ‘Prepare to be disappointed.’ I mean, Lisa used to be a dog trainer and I’m just a schmuck,” Singer-Vine laughs. “After meeting these people, you realize there is a massive audience out there who’s actually looking for that brutal, almost awkward truth, and not lyrics about flamboyant or lavish lifestyles.”

Creating the album “Unfortunately,” required an entirely different process from that of the three “Bop Cities.” In the latter’s case, the band finished the songs quickly, releasing them within a couple of weeks or months to keep their listener’s interests piqued. “Unfortunately,” on the other hand, called for hours of listening and relistening to the production and each line of every song.

There’s one lyric in particular that changed the entire trajectory of the writing for “Unfortunately.” According to Singer-Vine, it shifted the template for the whole album. On “Bop City 2,” there’s a line in the song “Caramel” that, although too risqué for print here, suggests a person upset or perturbed by an LGBTQ person’s lifestyle and sexual orientation might themselves be gay or lesbian.

“It was a song we wrote for months, sending lines back and forth, trying to get them perfect,” Singer-Vine recalls. “It changed the entire group, it changed what we were doing. I remember when we played our first show in San Francisco, we opened with ‘Caramel’ and I saw a few people in the front row were crying. That moment was a revelation, and my proudest. I was like, ‘Dude, just say something, and mean it.’”

It was then that Terror Jr. went hard to incorporate themes in their music that questioned white privilege, religion, homophobia and people cast out by mainstream society. It draws in a listener base that’s felt misunderstood historically, but can connect with each other through the music.

“I want to find all the angry, trampled-upon people. I seek them out so I can speak for them. And, I want to get on our own heads first,” Singer-Vine says. “Especially our fans of color and different cultures, I want them to hold us accountable. Like, let us do what we can. Make us do what we can.”

“The line that means a lot to me when I stand up there and sing ‘Caramel’ is, ‘If my skin was any darker, they’d be spilling my blood,’” Vitale adds. “We’re two white people who get to make music and we’ve gotten very lucky with what’s brought us to this point. I want to acknowledge that privilege.”

At the concert that same evening, Singer-Vine and Vitale do yet another meet-and-greet, as they’ve done throughout the tour. They hug their fans, some of whom say they’re shaking as they nervously take pictures with the band. But in those moments, there’s no separation between Terror Jr. and their listeners. And when the lights in the Warsaw go down at the start of the show, they stay that way for the first song. Vitale and Singer-Vine emerge on stage with a drummer and keyboardist, and a backup singer. They belt out “Maker,” the opening song on the album, completely in the dark. But then the soft, purple and blue lights turn a shade of white, and suddenly, you can see them — their smiling faces, their joy, everything about them.

David and Louise Turpin, the California parents who beat, starved and held 12 of their children captive inside their home, were sentenced Friday to life in prison.

The husband and wife pleaded guilty in February to 14 counts each of torture, dependent adult abuse, child endangerment and false imprisonment.

During their sentencing, both cried and wiped away tears as some of their children addressed the courtroom. The judge ruled the couple will be eligible for parole after 25 years.

"My parents took my whole life from me, now I’m taking my life back," one of the couple's daughters said. “Life may have been bad, but it made me strong. I saw my dad change my mom, they almost changed me. I’m a fighter, I’m strong.”

Disturbing details of the abuse came to light in January 2018 after one of the daughters, who was 17 at the time, escaped their home in Perris, California, and used a cellphone taken from the house to call 911. The girl, who officers initially thought was a child because she was so emaciated, told police that her brothers and sisters were being held by her parents and some of them were chained, investigators said.

When authorities entered the house, they found the children — aged 2 to 29 — being held in "dark and foul-smelling surroundings," authorities said.

Some were bound to their beds and furniture by chains and padlocks and many of the children told police they were "starving," according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

"I love both of my parents so much," a statement read in court from another daughter said. “God looks at the heart and I know he sees theirs. I’ve prayed often for them."

Twelve of the thirteen Turpin siblings were allegedly beaten, shackled to their beds, malnourished, denied access to the bathroom and only permitted to shower one time a year. TODAY

Louise Turpin read a statement in court, apologizing to her children.

"I'm sorry for everything I've done to hurt my children. I love my children so much," she said. "I want them to know that mom and dad are going to be OK."

David Turpin was so emotional, he had his lawyer read parts of his statement.

"I never intended for any harm to come to my children … I hope the very best for my children in the future," the lawyer read.

Prosecutors said the Turpin children were given only one rationed meal a day and allowed to shower once a year. Their parents would bake pies and not let their hungry children eat them, and would buy toys but forbid the children from opening or playing with them.

The children were forced to spend most of their time in the house. Neighbors told NBC Los Angeles last year that they knew the couple had a lot of children but weren't sure how many because "the kids didn't come out very often."

There were times the family was all out together, like on trips to Las Vegas where the Turpins renewed their vows. Videos showed the girls in pink dresses, white tights and heels. The boys wore dark suits with white shirts and red ties.

Kent Ripley, an Elvis impersonator who renewed the couple's vows at a Vegas chapel, said the children were always quiet and well-behaved.

Louise Turpin's sister, Teresa Robinette, said during an interview that the family gave the impression that they were "living the perfect life." She recounted how her sister would tell her about the Vegas trips and vacations at Disneyland.

Investigators, however, painted a very different picture.

Only one of the children — a son — was allowed to leave home to attend classes at a community college but was always accompanied by his mother.

The siblings would also get in trouble for things like "playing with water" while they washed their hands. Prosecutors said the punishment ranged from being beaten and choked to being shackled to their beds with no access to the bathroom for months at a time.

One of the daughters was allegedly the victim of a lewd act by her father, prosecutors said.

Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said in January 2018 that the abuse "started out as neglect" during the 17 years the family lived near Fort Worth, Texas, and intensified when they moved to California in 2010.

The couple's youngest child was the only one — of the 13 total — who appeared to have not been abused.

Despite the horrific torture authorities said the children endured, some of them told the courtroom Friday how much they loved their parents and said they did their best to raise them.

"I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up," one of the sons said. "Sometimes, I still have nightmares from things that have happened. … But that is the past and this is now. I love my parents and have forgiven them."

A statement from another daughter stated: "I want the court to know that our parents loved each other and loved each of their children. ... I believe with all my heart that our parents tried their best to raise all 13 of us and they wanted to give us a good life."

During a news conference after the sentencing, Jack Osborn, who represents seven of the adult children, said that his clients are “working very hard toward forgiveness" and said it was a "miracle" that they are thriving.

"Our clients are most of all survivors, they are not victims," he said.
The GAA is to ban overseas training for county squads and will also impose a restriction on the duration of home-based camps.

The GAA is to ban overseas training for county squads and will also impose a restriction on the duration of home-based camps.

The crackdown will apply from next year on and follows a series of controversies in recent seasons.

Armagh and Laois footballers both lost home advantage for one game in this season's Allianz League as punishment for breaking the rules on training camps last year.

Armagh travelled to Portugal while Laois went to Kerry. Both were deemed to have broken the rule because the camps were held outside the permitted time.

Armagh, who have failed to win a first-round Ulster game since 2014, are in Portugal again this week, but are not in breach of the rule, having received clearance from the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC).

Dublin footballers, who travelled to France, and Wexford hurlers, who went to Portugal, escaped sanction last year after insisting that their trips did not include training.

The explanations were treated with scepticism across the wider GAA but the investigating committee were unable to take any action due to a lack of proof. Armagh and Laois both admitted the offences, although both counties argued they had fulfilled the requirement for club games.

Congress amended the relevant rule this year, making it mandatory for counties to receive permission from the CCCC to undertake extended training camps either at home or abroad.

CCCC decided that permission would be granted in cases where counties gave a guarantee to have four weekends free for club activity between the end of the league and the opening championship game.

However, in a more sweeping move, permission will not be granted for overseas trips from 2020 on.

There will also be a limit on home-based camps, which cannot be longer than three days.

I’ve been reading and collecting the Book of Mormon my entire life in one form or another, from the illustrated “Book of Mormon for Beginning Readers” (or whatever it was called in the 1970s) to the official blue copy I handed out as a missionary, to Royal Skousen’s “Earliest Text.” I’ve also collected books written about the Book of Mormon, including much of Skousen’s Critical Text Project. I’ve appreciated being able to learn about the book and read it in these various formats particularly because I don’t usually like reading the same book more than once. This book edited by Grant Hardy gives a fresh new way to read it again, taking the official 2013 text and reformatting it to make for easier reading as well as to more easily identify various aspects, and also adding footnotes and other markers to point out changes gleaned from Skousen’s work, internal consistencies, and other interesting tidbits.

The book begins with the introduction from the 1981 edition “with minor modifications in 2013 (and the substitution of people for men in the third and next-to-last paragraphs),” (page vii) and then has the usual testimonies of three and eight witnesses, but then it also has the testimony of Emma Smith, taken from an interview by Joseph Smith III in 1879. In this, she mentions that Joseph did not have any manuscripts or books, what the plates felt like, that he did it “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the [seer] stone in it,” (page ix) and that she did not believe her husband capable of composing it by himself.

This is followed by the Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon, as you would find in a regular edition, although the Brief Explanation has an explanatory phrase inserted about the Plates of Ether. Then there is a Brief History of the Text, which is used as the editor’s introduction. In this, Hardy recounts the translation, printing, and subsequent editing and printing of the second edition.

He explains the work of Royal Skousen (“a professor of linguistics and English language at Brigham Young University, is the central figure in the academic analysis of the Book of Mormon text, including its origins, transmission, variants, and grammar”). He then describes what he has done in the book. “The footnotes here highlight instances in which earlier readings of the original and printer’s manuscripts may be more accurate, clearer, or more felicitous…. The notes here, however, are simplified, dispensing with Skousen’s indications of variants with a source, original and corrected readings in the manuscripts, spelling anomalies, and types of manuscript changes.” The original chapter divisions are indicated (“since these were apparently on the gold plates and thus were intended by ancient authors”), but the modern chapter and verse indicators are still included as well (page xvi).

His introduction ends with a statement that I believe sums up the purpose of the entire work: “The narrative complexity and coherence of the Book of Mormon — highlighted in this edition — offer some of the strongest evidences of its historicity and miraculous translation. As we learn to read the sacred text as carefully as possible, with detailed attention to language, structure, and historical context, its message of salvation through Jesus Christ will become more compelling and its lessons for life more clear” (page xvii). There is also a note that his royalties will be donated to the Humanitarian Aid Fund.

As examples of helpful explanations given in footnotes, footnote ‘a’ on the title page says, “Joseph Smith in 1838 said that the title page of the Book of Mormon is ‘not by any means a modern composition, either of mine, or of any other man who has lived or does live in this generation.’ For the 1840 edition, he added the name Moroni below the last line of the text as an indication of the original author, though the name was deleted in 1879.” Footnote ‘c’ says, “On the 1830 title page, Joseph Smith was identified as ‘author and proprietor’ in order to comply with copyright regulations. The preface to that same edition included Joseph’s assertion that he had translated ‘by the gift and power of God’ and that ‘the plates of which hath been spoken, were found in the township of Manchester, Ontario county, New York.’ The inscription ‘Translated by Joseph Smith, Junior’ has been on the title page of every edition since 1837” (page 1).

Here is a diagram of how a typical page is formatted, along with more footnote examples:

There is a lot of information packed into a typical page, and it is a little confusing at first. The section called “Using the Study Edition” (similar to the diagram above) will definitely come in handy until the reader becomes thoroughly familiar with the conventions used. It is at least much easier to decode than Skousen’s “Critical Text” volumes.

There are woodcuts by Brian Kershisnik at the beginning of each book, representing something from it. I particularly liked the one for Alma, with a seedling representing the lecture on faith growing from a seed. Third Nephi has two hands taking the resurrected Christ’s hand, showing the nail marks, while First Nephi has the Liahona.

At the back of the volume there is a collection of very helpful maps and charts, such as “Record Keepers in the Book of Mormon,” “Key Families in the Book of Mormon,” “Time Line of Nephite History,” and “Chronology of the Translation.” There are five pages of “Joseph Smith’s Statements on the Book of Mormon” followed by three and a half pages of “Stories of the Translation.” These provide insights into how Joseph Smith felt about the book, and how it was translated, some well known, and others not as much.

There is a section titled “General Notes” that talks about apparent anachronisms, the consistent internal chronology and coherence of the text, demographics, geography, language, the translation, and witnesses. These notes are very interesting, with the latest scholarship, as well as faith-promoting commentary: “This sacred record bears testimony of Jesus Christ from beginning to end, with an invitation to come unto Him and to see his Hand at work throughout history as He answers prayers, keeps covenants, and prepares a people for his coming” (page 623). A list of good books for further reading is also provided, with authors such as Brant Gardner, Terryl Givens, John Sorenson, and John Welch, among many others.

A section on “Literary Parallelism” is over eight pages long. It compares different types of parallelisms in the Bible with examples found in the Book of Mormon. “The writings of the prophets are much easier to understand when the English renditions of poetic passages are arranged so that they reflect the underlying poetic structure. Indeed, most modern translations of the Bible do this. It is easier to follow the prophets’ thoughts and arguments if we know where to expect repetition and where to look for new ideas. In this edition of the Book of Mormon, the lengthy excerpts from Isaiah that appear in 1 and 2 Nephi are presented in poetic form, but there are other sections of the Book of Mormon that also exhibit Hebrew-style parallelism, and these have similarly been arranged into lines and stanzas. While there are still many uncertainties about the Nephite language, reformed Egyptian (Mormon 9.32), and the nature of the translation, it is not surprising that when the Book of Mormon prophets wished to give particular emphasis to their message, they often employed the techniques of Hebrew poetry. In fact, characteristic biblical patterns of parallelism can be illustrated with examples from the Book of Mormon” (pages 625-626).

There is a helpful “Index of Names” based on the index in the 1981 Book of Mormon edition, with some differences, including variant spellings from the manuscripts. Finally, the “Reference Guide to the Book of Mormon” from the Doubleday edition is included, which also has some additions.

I have been enjoying reading this edition of the Book of Mormon. It gathers together many different resources to help bring out new insights, as well as pointing to things that are in the standard edition that may have been overlooked before. It has given me new appreciation for the internal consistency of the Book of Mormon, as well as a better understanding of its message. For someone who has read it many times already, it helps in seeing it with fresh eyes again.
One of the greatest assets of the Republican Party of Florida continues to be the Florida Democrats, who repeatedly find ways to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. They proved it again this week in Broward County, publicly organizing to support former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel (D), who many view as culpable for his agency’s many failures related to the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida that left 17 students and teachers dead, and another 17 injured.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) wasted little time after he was sworn into office this January to take action against Sheriff Israel, suspending him a mere three days into his term as governor, via an executive order citing neglect of duty and incompetence by Israel. DeSantis also appointed Gregory Tony to take over as the new Broward County Sheriff.

Israel sued to try and keep his job, but has been rejected by the courts, with the Broward County Circuit Court dismissing his lawsuit against the governor earlier this month.

Israel’s local Democrats apparently find him far more sympathetic.

According to a report by the Sun Sentinel, at the meeting of the Broward County Democratic Executive Committee earlier this week, a resolution was considered to condemn DeSantis for suspending Israel “without good cause and with no hearing.”

The resolution was not able to be officially passed because the committee lacked the quorum of members needed for a vote, but Anthony Man, the Sun Sentinel reporter who attended the meeting, noted that “[b]ased on applause and comments, most of the almost 100 people present for the discussion supported the resolution.”

Democrats can grumble about DeSantis’ suspension of Israel, but the inconvenient fact for them is that the governor is enjoying a “remarkably high” approval rating. Even his actions against Israel have been viewed more as a just response to severe professional malpractice rather than a partisan political maneuver by a Republican seeking to remove a Democrat.

To argue that Israel was suspended “without good cause” requires one to ignore the many missed opportunities, poor planning, miscommunications, neglect, and other failures by the Broward Sheriff’s Office under Israel’s leadership. It is a long and heartbreaking list, considering the horrific toll. Among the most egregious:

Broward deputies were called to the shooter’s (I am following the practice of the victim’s families in avoiding using his name) home dozens of times and were given direct reports of his erratic, disturbing, and increasingly violent behavior, but never arrested him, referred him to mental health treatment, or took any action that would have barred him from legally purchasing a gun.

Israel had enthusiastically supported controversial alternative education and discipline policies that sought to minimize juvenile arrests, even when the student was being violent or threatening school safety.

Multiple Broward deputies, including MSD school resource officer Scot Peterson, waited in the school parking lot during the shooting, never even attempting to enter the building until after it was over. The delay undoubtedly cost lives, according to analysis by multiple members of the media, government officials, and the MSD Public Safety Commission.

Israel himself had overseen a change in the BSO training to say that deputies “may” engage instead of “shall” engage an active shooter.

DeSantis sent clear signals during the campaign that he was willing to remove Israel, so voters knew that was a possibility when they cast a ballot for him last November. He obviously did not view it as a politically risky position to take, and with his suspension of Israel and several other negligence officials around the state getting significant media attention, it is undoubtedly a factor in his approval ratings.

Israel should be fading away as a media story, but actions like this by the Broward County Democrats shove him right back in the spotlight again. Israel is unrepentant about his failures and continues to insist he did nothing wrong — a tough pill for many to swallow when they know the names and faces of those who died.

If the Democrats want to kick off the 2020 election season by embracing a disgraced former sheriff whose negligence has a body count, then they are sending a clear message to voters that partisan politics matter more to them than good policy, ethical government, or life itself.

Deep divisions among MEPs made it clear on Thursday (19 April) that the social security coordination directive, aimed at enforcing the rights of mobile workers, would be postponed for the next European Parliament, after May’s EU elections.

“The report is not at all ready for a vote in plenary,” MEP Helga Stevens (Belgium, ECR) told the chamber, claiming its adoption should be postponed. “The vote will only highlight the division in the Parliament in the last parliamentary session,” she defended.

A narrow cross-party majority (291 votes in favour, 284 against and 6 abstentions) ended up backing Stevens’ motion to postpone the vote. EU lawmakers will, therefore, start the process again under the new legislature.

“The conservatives and liberals, with the help of some social liberal members, following a group of member states, have blocked any real progress for workers moving within Europe,” Guillaume Balas (France, S&D), rapporteur of the file, regretted.

Balas put the text to vote to conclude the first reading and avoid a potential reexamination of what has been assessed as a rather progressive position by the Parliament after the elections.

The social security coordination directive enforces the rights of mobile workers, including frontiers and posted worker, across Europe. Last time it was revised was fifteen years ago. The Commission concluded that the legislation was outdated and it did not fit the current world of work.

Commissioner for Social Affairs Marianne Thyssen told the chamber on Wednesday (17 April) that the update “is much needed to address new challenges and opportunities in the fields of long-term care, unemployment benefits, family benefits and the rules on applicable legislation for posted workers”.

Thyssen called on MEPs to support Balas’ report, although without success, insisting “that the compromise we reached should inspire us for the work that remains to be done”.

“By refusing to vote on newly updated rules on social security coordination, they refused to guarantee to all EU workers effective social protection that does not discriminate anyone,” Ballas concluded.

The modernisation of the legislation could have been the cherry on the top of the European Pillar of Social Rights, as the Commission has managed to pass twenty-four out of the twenty-seven proposals tabled during its mandate.

In the last plenary session, MEPs approved the establishment of the European Labour Authority and the directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, particularly important in a moment of growing incertitude for non-traditional workers.

“In the Parliamentary history of Europe, never before we have seen so much progress made in social affairs,” Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker argued in Strasbourg.

MEPs approve the creation of the European Labour Authority On Tuesday (16 April), MEPs approved the creation of a European Labour Authority, as well as several positions that favour the rights of European workers and combat social dumping. But major changes still need to be made. EURACTIV France reports.

National divisions

“I count on the wisdom of the member states for this dialogue to be concluded,” Juncker said a few days ago during a conference on the Future of Work, about the need for an agreement on the file.

It did not work. In spite of the efforts by the Romanian presidency to find a compromise that could accommodate the position of the Parliament and the concerns of some member states, particularly in the East, EU ambassadors rejected the provisional agreement.

The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and Austria were already against the general approach the Council agreed on and therefore, their opposition did not come as a surprise. Sweden and the Czech Republic rejected the compromise as well.

Malta, Hungary and Poland decided to abstain, allowing a blocking minority to stop the text from moving forward to the Council of Ministers.

The same divisions seen in the Council were visible during the Parliament debate on the matter, as northern and western MEPs shared their concerns on the legislative file.

For some, the new legislation does not prevent fraud. Citizens working in a member state other than theirs could export unemployment benefits to their country of residence for a limited period of time.

As it will be the country in which the citizen has worked carrying the cost and not the country of residence, workers enjoying unemployment benefits from one member state wouldn’t be subject to the applicable rules.

Some countries consider that under this system, workers might not be encouraged to search for a job. “The modernisation will provide the national administrations with better tools to fight fraud and abuses,” argued Thyssen.

Other member states and MEPs wanted to introduce in the legislation the indexation of family benefits. This would mean a reduction of the benefits when the members of the family are residing in a different member state.

This practice is currently illegal according to the EU law, as it is discriminatory. The Commission started an infringement procedure against Austria in January precisely because of this.

“The paradox is that we have a market that allows free movement but we have very different social security systems and therefore, workers are in a very vulnerable position in terms of portability of their rights and protection. This was the aim of the revision,” Balas argued.

“Free movement of workers only exists if mobile workers preserve their social protection,” agreed Thyssen who warned that the modernisation of the social security coordination should not be further postponed.

Thyssen announced on Tuesday (16 April) the Commission will launch a debate on moving to qualified majority voting in recommendations on the harmonisation of social security systems in Europe.

If neither the member states nor the Parliament has been able to agree on doing so only on mobile workers, it seems rather unlikely they will for all national systems.

One of America's wealthiest cities has a huge problem with public poop.

Between 2011 and 2018, San Francisco experienced a massive increase in reported incidents of human feces found on public streets.

In 2011, just over 5,500 reports were logged by the San Francisco Department of Public Works; in 2018, the number increased to more than 28,000.

The government watchdog Open the Books documented the sharp increase over time in a stunning chart, first spotted by the BuzzFeed editor John Paczkowski.

Open the Books/City of San Francisco

Notably, this is a chart of only documented reports — the actual amount of feces on San Francisco's streets is likely even higher than these statistics suggest.

"I will say there is more feces on the sidewalks than I've ever seen growing up here," San Francisco Mayor London Breed told NBC in a 2018 interview. "That is a huge problem, and we are not just talking about from dogs — we're talking about from humans."

San Francisco has struggled with a feces problem for years. The city even employs a "Poop Patrol" that attempts to keep the streets clean and focuses on the Tenderloin neighborhood.

But the problem is bigger than just keeping the streets clean — the issue appears to be related to the city's struggle to accommodate its homeless population amid skyrocketing rent prices and a decreasing supply of affordable housing.

A 2017 survey of San Francisco's homeless population counted nearly 7,500 people living on the street. That population faces limited public resources, and public bathrooms are no exception.

Whether the Poop Patrol is able to reverse the trend on San Francisco's streets remains to be seen, but there's an indication that the crew is a bandage on a problem much bigger than dirty streets.
The country is called a gem of the Baltics. That Hinduism reached its shores is an interesting thought in itself.

It is summer in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and I am seated in one of the classrooms of the historic old building of Vilnius University listening to Professor Nijole Laurinkiene’s presentation on the Sun in traditional context. Mid-way through her lecture, I hear distinct chants of “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” filtering in through the large windows behind me. A group of young boys are singing praises of Lord Krishna outside the campus grounds. Looking at my surprised reaction, a musician who is also attending the lecture and is seated next to me says with a smile in his broken English laced with heavy Lithuanian accent, “That is Indian no? We have lot of Hindus here who follow Krishna and even Shiva.”

Intrigued, over the next few days of my stay in Vilnius while I did come across several Lithuanians confessing to be fans of India and its culture, I also had opportunities to interact with a select few who have immersed themselves completely into becoming followers of Hindu traditions. While some enrolled themselves with Hindu organisations like International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Shri Sathya Sai Baba and Brahma Kumari, there were others who were seeking the internet to seek information on what it takes to become a good Hindu. Students of Indology in Lithuania appeared to be at an advantage over others as their curriculum enabled them to undertake trips to India to understand and explore the country and its religions.

Located in Eastern Europe, Lithuania is called a gem of the Baltics as it shares borders with the Baltic Sea on one side and countries like Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia on the other. That Hinduism should have reached its shores seems to be an interesting thought in itself.

Indologist and social anthropologist Samanta Galinaityt, a first year Master’s student at the Institute of Asian and Transcultural Studies at Vilnius University, who has travelled to India twice believes that though there are a lot of similarities between Lithuanian traditional Gods and Hindu Gods but it is hard to say that Hinduism as a concept exists in Lithuanian culture.

“In my strong opinion, different concepts of Hinduism are getting popular nowadays, but they are just concepts. For instance, we have a lot of different Yoga schools in Lithuania as well as a lot of houses related with Ayurveda. Of course, there are some individuals who practise or follow Hindu traditions but usually in small groups, communities or in private.” Samanta continues that she has met quite a lot of Lithuanians following the religion too. “I have seen a lot of Lithuanian devotees from ISKCON community, but there are also some individuals who follow the Hindu Gods as well. There are people who follow Hindu religion, but there is no data based on this,” she points out.

I meet one such follower a 50-year-old art collector, (he wishes to remain anonymous) who claims he makes it a point to visit his favourite temple in southern India twice every year, and has also given up meat to become a full time vegetarian.

In her paper “Strangers Among Ours: Contemporary Hinduism in Lithuania” written by Dr Milda Alisauskiene, Professor with the Vytautas Magnus University as part of a special volume on Hinduism in Europe, she analyses the phenomenon of contemporary Hinduism in Lithuania from historical and sociological perspectives and discusses diverse forms of its expressions and public attitudes towards it. Her paper points out that Hinduism in Lithuania might be considered a new religious tradition.

Dr Alisauskiene writes that groups representing contemporary Hinduism are active in large cities and smaller towns of Lithuania. “The adherents of these groups are citizens, majority of them have higher education, usually within natural or technical sciences and have cosmopolitan worldviews. Majority of contemporary Hinduism communities in Lithuania have affiliates in smaller towns, they also organise meetings in the rural areas but these are allocated for mainly citizens. Women prevail among the followers of contemporary Hinduism and men make up around one third of the followers. With this aspect contemporary Hinduism does not distinguish among other religious phenomena as women religiosity and their active participation in religious activities is well known and widely discussed phenomenon among researchers of religion in Western and post-communist societies.”

The age of the members of contemporary Hinduism groups, she continues, varies; though around 35-50 year-old individuals prevail.

She further writes, “Two public surveys conducted in 2007 and 2014 showed the dynamics of Lithuanian population knowledge about religious groups existing in the country. Among groups of contemporary Hinduism best known was ISKCON (34% in 2007 and 48% in 2014). Public knowledge about other groups of contemporary Hinduism differed. In some cases like Osho community knowledge remained the same, in other cases like Sathya Sai Baba community, Sahadza Yoga and Brahma Kumaris public knowledge slightly increased.”

Dr Alisauskiene further states in the paper that historical analysis showed that interest in Orientalism and Hinduism might be traced to the sixteenth century, however the institutionalization of this interest took place in the nineteenth century with the establishment of study programmes in Vilnius and later other universities.

“During the Soviet times, religion was removed from public life, however private religious practices continued. ISKCON started its activities in the late 1970s and its adherents experienced persecutions from Soviet authorities. Since the 1990s, with new conditions for freedom of religion possibilities, groups of contemporary Hinduism became even more active. ISKCON and Osho were two organisations whose activities were mostly visible in the 1990s. Art of Living and other so called spirituality groups of Hindu origins were more active in Lithuania.”

She continues that groups of contemporary Hinduism in Lithuania are mainly global organisations with centred management and controlled content of teaching, even more if the leader is still alive. “Despite global aspect these religious organisations in Lithuania have localised their activities in a new social context. The manifestation of such localisation is emphasis on the spirituality essence of these groups instead of going into the competitive field of religion with mainstream Roman Catholicism. An important feature of contemporary Hinduism in Lithuania is the ethnicity of members who are Lithuanians and not Hindus. Contemporary Hinduism in Lithuania is a social phenomenon indicating and manifesting social and religious transformations from homogeneous field of religion to religious diversity and reflecting the trends of religious individualisation,” she states.

But Dr Audrius Beinorius, Professor of Indian and Buddhist Studies, Institute of Asian and Transcultural Studies Vilnius University thinks otherwise.

“Dealing academically with India for more than 30 years I don’t believe there has been a rise in people following the Hindu religion in Lithuania, because many people are becoming more and more secular and not intended to replace one religion (local Catholic Christianity) with another (Hindu). They are searching mainly for practical spirituality, that would conduct a healthy way of life, help control stress and emotions, increase self-conscious attitude and so on,” he says.

ISKCON, he continues, is among the older Hindu religious organisations that was perhaps not most popular at the end of Soviet occupation period and was one of the spiritual alternatives of atheistic communist ideology.

“During last 10 years this movement is evidently decreasing in number of followers, perhaps it contradicts the local habits of social life.”

He points out that indigenous Baltic religion has many common elements with ancient Vedic religious culture and less with contemporary Hinduism.

“Lithuania was the last European country to accept Christianity. Baltic people have been fighting for almost 300 years against united European crusaders to project their own ancestral religion, language and culture. Thus similarities between Sanskrit and Lithuanian languages are tremendous, as the names of Gods namely Viešpatis (Višpati), Dievas (Devas), Vejas (Vayu), Ašvieniai (Ašvins), some mythological elements, fire rituals, polyphonic religious chanting etc.” He states that it’s a pity, not much is left during last 400 years of brutal Christianisation.

“The indigenous Baltic religion movement nowadays is mostly reconstructions. And thus these people are deeply interested in Vedic tradition and Hinduism, not because having intention to become Hindus, but because living examples of Hindu practices could help in reconstructing ancient Baltic religion. To my knowledge except ISKCON movement members there are almost no cases of Lithunians consciously and formally converting into Hinduism. Even followers of numerous yoga schools, among which Shivananda Yoga Center is the most popular, never consider themselves as a Hindu. Because chanting of mantras is considered to be auspicious and purifying your mind and soul, but that does not imply becoming a Hindu.”

Dr Beinorius believes that he does not see any sudden interest in Hinduism among Lithuanians. “Yes many people are visiting India, travelling to historical and archaeological sites, relaxing in beaches, claiming Himalayas. People are interested in the cultural heritage of India: Indian classical dances, classical music, Ayurvedic treatment, Jyotish predictions, meditations or even Bollywood cinema, but as I said before cultural interest has nothing to do with intentions for religious conversion. Lithuanians, like other Westerners are not entirely able to connect Indian gurus seriously and properly as Indians do, because too strong sense of individuality, pride and non-obeying that hinders their devotion. They are more interested in following a kind of ‘scientific raja yoga’ created by Swami Vivekanda, Advaitic perspective of Sri Ramana Maharishi and Nisargadatta Maharaj, or Intellectual Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo, than purely devotional bhakti of Sai Baba, Art of Living of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and similar. Perhaps our people trust themselves and their own efforts instead of waiting for blessings from gurus of divine anugraha,” he says.

Responding to the queries on whether ISKCON has seen a rise in Lithuanians seeking to follow the Hindu religion, Shatakula Das, of ISKCON Communications, Vilnius, Lithuania, said, “Yes, ISKCON has seen a rise in Lithuania for many years. ISKCON is part of the Gaudiya, or Chaitanya Vaishnava, tradition, which hails from the eastern regions of India. While we don’t have the exact number, an estimated 2,000 people are connected with ISKCON in Lithuanian through the Summer Vaishnava festival (which is hosted by the temple) and other program and events which are held regularly at the local centre. ISKCON Lithuanian’s facebook group Lietuvos Vaishnavai has 2,166 members. There is no exact statistics on the number of followers we have every year but approximately 10 new people appear yearly at the temple or festival,” he states continuing that ISKCON in Lithuania started in 1979.

“In December 1989, the first community of Krishna Consciousness was registered in Vilnius and after a few months in Kaunas. Now we have 5 communities registered and many legal public entities such as Vedic Centers, or Vaishnava Culture Centres around Lithuania.”

(CNN) The Mueller report -- the result of a 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election -- didn't end the debate over whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice or acted inappropriately while in office. But there's one thing it proved beyond any debate: The President lies with remarkable ease and cajoles those around him to do the same.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

The examples of Trump's willingness to bend the truth to breaking documented by special counsel Robert Mueller are legion. Here are just a few:

Trump's dim view of the value of telling the truth rolls downhill in his administration. Again, the Mueller report documents a series of instances where the President's advisers lie either because they believe that's what he wants them to do or because he has normalized it to the point that they no longer feel as though it's even the wrong thing to do.

The most glaring of these distortions came out of the mouth of White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, who, in May 2017, said this in the wake of the firing of Comey

"The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey. The DOJ [Department of Justice] lost confidence in Director Comey. Bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey. And most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director."

Pressed by reporters on that that last comment -- about the "rank and file" losing confidence in Comey -- suggesting that the rank and file were supportive of Comey, Sanders responded this way: "We've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things."

It turns out that, well, wasn't true. Here's what Mueller wrote about the episode:

"Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from 'countless members of the FBI' was a 'slip of the tongue.' She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything."

On Fox News Channel Thursday night, Sanders explained that discrepancy this way: "I acknowledge that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue ... that a number of both current and former FBI agents agreed with the President."

But at least according to what she told the special counsel's office, it is untrue. She said that her claim that "countless members" of the FBI were glad to see Comey go was "not founded on anything."

This is the culture that Trump has ushered into the White House -- and cultivated. He not only shows little concern for what's true, he is also entirely unwilling to ever admit when he has been caught in a clear lie. (Remember when Trump said, on Air Force One , that he had no idea where Michael Cohen got the money to pay off Stormy Daniels? So, yeah.)

That such a culture exists in the highest elected office in the country shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who has been paying attention over the past few years. It was apparent from Day 1 of the administration when then press secretary Sean Spicer was put out there by Trump to insist, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the inaugural crowd who watched Trump be sworn in as the 45th president was the largest in American history.

In small and large ways since that day way back in January 2017, Trump and those around him have repeatedly shown a willingness to obfuscate, distort and downright lie when it suits their needs.

What the Mueller report did then was not reveal that this culture existed within the White House. Rather, through the steady accumulation of facts and data, it showed just how pervasive the willingness to not be honest is within not only the Oval Office but also the people who work for the President.

It's a stark and startling set of facts. And not one that even the most loyal Trump ally would rightly dispute.
The special counsel report makes three things clear: First, there was never any evidence to back up the collusion conspiracy. Second, there was not enough evidence to accuse President Trump of obstruction.

Third, the lawyers that put together the report were really disappointed with both findings. Trump was right all along that Robert Mueller’s team was “conflicted.”

Even though It specifically states that the investigation “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated” with Russia, and that because “the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime,” it nudges House Democrats in the direction of impeachment anyway.

Attorney General William Barr accurately summarized the report Thursday morning when he repeated over and over again that the investigation uncovered no evidence to back up the ridiculous Russia conspiracy and that Mueller’s team deferred to his supervisors on the question of obstruction, which Barr and his deputy Rod Rosenstein settled themselves by saying there wasn't enough there, either.

But the full report still contains little hints for Democrats that it’s possible there in fact was collusion (despite the lack of evidence) and that they would be justified in pursuing their own corruption case. Did they let Maxine Waters edit this thing?

After meticulously documenting the events of the 2016 campaign and finding nothing that showed Trump or his campaign coordinated on any criminal level with Russia, Mueller’s team slipped in this gem: “While this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office [of Special Counsel] believes to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible … the Office cannot rule out the possibility [that] unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events describe in the report.”

They might as well have ended the report with, “To be continued, maybe ...”

Given unlimited time, money and power, the special counsel found nothing. Adding that caveat undermines the whole reason that the investigation ended. The point of concluding an investigation is that it’s done!

On the obstruction question, the report acknowledges three crucial reasons that it declined to make a prosecutorial decision. One of them is a longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. But the other two reasons are more important: that there was no underlying crime in relation to Russia and the campaign, and that there was “substantial evidence” that any of Trump’s efforts to curtail the department’s investigations (including with the firing of James Comey) were undertaken because he honestly “believed that the erroneous perception he was under [personal] investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and foreign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia.”

The report does lay out evidence to the contrary, suggesting it’s at least possible Trump was actually more concerned with the investigations turning up something criminal — such as when he told White House aides to say that Comey was fired over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, a clear pretext from the beginning.

But what the report doesn’t say is that Trump would have very obvious political reasons in choosing not to be up-front about that. It doesn’t take mental strain to guess how Democrats would have reacted if Trump had said he was firing Comey because he wouldn’t publicly state that the president wasn’t under investigation. That would have put us in the exact same place we are today.

That he thought Democrats would believe he had fired Comey over the Clinton controversy speaks to Trump’s self-delusion, not to criminality.

But in any case, the special counsel team admits there was no evidence of an underlying crime, and that there was “substantial evidence” that Trump’s actions in office regarding the investigation had a noncriminal motive. And yet the report includes a nice road map for Democrats who want to impeach him anyway, with a suggestion that even if Trump did not obstruct justice, he’s nonetheless corrupt.

“We concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the President 's conduct is justified,” the special counsel team wrote, “inquiries to determine whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his constitutionally assigned duties.”

In case the point wasn't quite getting across, they added that Congress may still “apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office” because it “accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”

Is that tortured cliche really something we needed to hear again?

Democrats and liberals in the media threw a fit because Barr used the phrase “no collusion” in his press conference Thursday, because it’s the same one Trump has used. I’m sure they’re tickled pink, though, at seeing their own language -- “no person is above the law! — used in the report, justifying their impeachment fever-dreams.

The special counsel team didn’t find anything on Trump. The report makes that much clear. But it also makes it clear that it’s not the result the special counsel team wanted.
Since the announcement of DUNE 2020, many fans have been wondering what sort of visual storytelling to expect from the upcoming film which is presently in production.

(Follow duneinfo.com @duneinfo to learn more.)

I will be speaking with various industry artists to determine what sort of aesthetic we can expect from the film release and get an insight into how the DUNE lore and story may be visually presented.

For freelance concept artist, Simon Goinard, the art of visual storytelling involves a process of finding a moment reduced from storyboard images that explore narrativity, as is the case for his research work for DUNE.

When it’s ready, the results speak for themselves. If a poet’s task is to capture a moment in just a handful of words, then an artist’s image can inspire a poem of an epic thousand-word tale.

Simon’s skillful collection is impressive, producing a combination of geometric, abstract and impressionist images for a wide range of clients, including Disney, WBros, Ubisoft, 20th Century Fox and many more (links at end of page). Some of his more recent works involve concept art development for his DUNE portfolio. Although this work is not directly related to the movie development, I’m hoping that with Simon’s feedback, viewers can get an understanding into working processes and ideas from experts that could give us some visual queues of what to expect. Although his newest additions are not yet available, I spoke with Simon to ask him about what we can expect to see from the upcoming work and how he visualizes the DUNE lore. To get an idea of how he will present the work, I wanted to know what his approach would be for mood and tone.

DUNE lore, mood and tone

“Basically the main idea was to have at least one bit of storytelling in each of pieces.” Says Simon, “as they were primarily made as an image board, the mindset was really to test narrativity in the DUNE lore. Right after that I tried to experiment with simple geometric and/or organic designs when possible.”

Utilizing digital tools, and trained in oils and acrylic, what visual artists such as Simon are capable of producing is nothing short of staggering. The range and depth and vision can be heightened and edited a thousand ways. Fans of Dune are very specific when it comes to their personal vision. When reading Frank Herbert’s novels, I personally often imagined a very eldritch and Gothic universe. DUNE has a cult following and a loyal and particular fan base, and expectations for the upcoming film are mixed. What a few are most concerned with in regard to the visualization often comes down to CGI treating the world as a new Star Wars, making it as big and as grand and showy as possible.

For this reason, some fans are curious about practical effects over CGI, which brings to mind one burning question. Where on earth is like Arrakis when we regard location? I asked Simon Goinard what sort of locations he thinks would best capture the film’s aesthetic, and how he thinks the film would be best conveyed.

Arrakis Settings – Practicality and CGI

“I don’t like the mood of the Sahara desert for DUNE, I really don’t. Arrakis is harsh, stronger than just emptiness. Too strong for just plain practical locations, frankly.”

Regarding the practical effects approached (David Lynch’s DUNE 1984, for example) it’s easy to see why CGI might be preferable. DUNE 1984 was a great film when I was a young teen but admittedly didn’t age well and visually often falls short. Today’s audience craves for something more, and to really capture the character of Arrakis, we would have to see this inhospitable place in all its vastness and darkness and hostility.

“At the end of the day, DUNE is a scifi novel, it should feel out of this world,” Simon explains. “So I’ll go for CGI here.”

There is nowhere on Earth like Arrakis. CGI has come a long way, and in my own view, I think a soft combination of CGI and practical techniques, if done well, could deliver good on a vision of Arrakis. There are many ancient buildings and temples that, if manipulated visually from old buildings and ancient temples of the middle east, could provide great reference points for The Citadel of Leto, for example and other such buildings.

Visual storytelling in epic battles

DUNE is an epic, the stories comprise history with houses and family names and tribes that reach throughout it’s expansive story. And fans want to see battles that matter. I asked Simon how he would portray epic battles in visual story telling in DUNE and what ideas he would be eager to explore?

“Story telling is linked to unsaid things most of the time, that’s strange to say but its a fact. What the viewer imagine in a picture will always tell more than what he see in it right away, and that’s what you should try to aim for. DUNE is no exception so I would go for something like two characters fighting in dynamic poses, both of them engulfed in shadows fighting in a sand storm for example. Shadow play Basically.”

Sandworms

This creature is a fan favourite, something many loved about the Lynch film (myself included) and had a clear vision of from the books. I’m very much looking forward to seeing Simon’s representation of the Sandworms, of which I think I can see a very distant teaser in one of his pieces.

So, I asked him: “When approaching this animal, what is your method and how do you intend to present them in your Dune portfolio? (More menacing, or as a distant reference).”

“I’ve already designed the Sandworms I would love to see, two types actually, but I will not share them. I’m basically keeping the DUNE landmarks hidden from my website for now.”

With two Sandworms in the design, I’d like to guess Simon is thinking about the Sandtrout as it was introduced on Arrakis before growing into the devouring behemoth we know from the novels, artistic representations and films.

Simon’s work beautifully captures contrasts and lighting, the white and violet working with deep, amaranth reds and black. I wanted to know if these choices were intuitive or if he approached his work with a steady plan. I asked Simon how these choices bring out a character.

“Yes it’s planned. I’ve strangely always seen the DUNE world in extreme opposite contrasts. Everything is at war in its universe for me (and I really think that a black and white film of DUNE could work extremely well by the way.) In term of paintings I will manifest this by thinking like Mark Rothko or like a Fauvist painter, that’s why you have those color choices in my pictures.”



Impressionism & mood

In case you aren’t aware of Mark Rothko’s abstract impressionism, these influences are visible in some of Simon’s works. Rothko demonstrates colour combinations and harmonies that artists can find inspiring for backgrounds, setting, mood and contrastive elements, a perfect inspirational choice for colour relations, and would explain too why Simon can visualize a black and white film of DUNE.

Simon Goinard’s work represents a deep understanding of colour theory which he draws on as he explores alien worlds and represents ethereal moments and strange technology, complementing a French and German abstract impressionistic style.

“On top of that my strokes are often impressionistic yes, as I search for some kind of mastery in them all of the time.” said Simon. When asked about his personal goals for this project, he explained: “In term of goals, apart from the storytelling, I think showing a constant personal vision of the lore is my priority here.”

The special counsel investigation was often cast as a clash between President Trump and Robert S. Mueller III. But there was always a third player, for whom victory seemed assured no matter the outcome.

Russian President Vladi­mir Putin set this sequence of events in motion with a Kremlin campaign to destabilize American democracy. That operation and its aftermath inflamed partisan tensions in the United States, eroded public confidence in core institutions and triggered a two-year investigation that consumed the nation’s attention and much of the Trump presidency.

The investigation may be finished now that the bulk of the report has been released, but the political battle it has generated in the United States — and the advantage Putin sees for Russia in that infighting — appears far from over.

In a sign of the Russian leader’s confidence on that front, Putin could not resist preemptive gloating in the days leading up to Thursday’s release. The entire Russia inquiry, Putin said with a smirk last week, was like “a mountain that brought forth a mouse.”

Speaking at an event in St. Petersburg, not far from where Russian trolls unleashed torrents of disinformation on American voters, Putin dismissed the U.S. effort to understand what had happened as “complete nonsense intended only for the domestic audience and used for interior political combat.”

It is a self-serving assessment that fails to acknowledge significant costs to Moscow, but U.S. officials and experts find it hard to argue with the view of the United States as a nation beset by internal dysfunction and strife.

In the months after the 2016 election, there was debate among U.S. intelligence analysts on Russia about whether the Kremlin operation’s gains exceeded its costs — economic sanctions, the expulsion of diplomatic personnel and further deterioration in its relations with the West.

That debate has waned, current and former officials said, with most describing the outcome as an overall win for Putin. The United States is led by a Kremlin-backed candidate who frequently praises autocrats, disparages allies and — based on the findings in the Mueller report — sought repeatedly to thwart the Russia investigation.

The smug display in St. Petersburg was “vintage Putin,” said William J. Burns, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008. Putin “likes to be snarky when he sees an event breaking his way. The backdrop is his sense that [Russia’s interference in 2016] worked,” that he saw vulnerability in the fraying American political landscape and “was able to sow even further chaos.”

Though always bound to be contentious, the special counsel inquiry had the potential to create a clarifying and unifying moment for the United States, a chance to stop arguing over what did and did not happen and confront more difficult questions about why it was possible and whether it could happen again.

Instead, the Mueller report itself has become something to fight over, viewed from political extremes as either exonerating or damning to the president, fulfilling or failing to uphold the rule of law, affirming or discrediting the press and its coverage of Russia and Trump.

The Mueller report may provide a definitive record of what happened. However, “it’s not going to bring any closure,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior U.S. intelligence analyst focused on Russia, now at the Center for a New American Security. “We’ll continue living in these two different realities.”

If anything, the report has caused additional splintering, with divisions coming into view between Mueller’s team and the Justice Department. While Attorney General William P. Barr has essentially declared that Trump is legally in the clear, the report suggests Mueller’s team believed it had found compelling evidence that the president obstructed justice — reigniting the prospect of aggressive follow-up investigations by Congress.

Setting aside the issues of collusion and obstruction, the country’s polarized view of the Russia investigation is perhaps most evident in connection to the least contentious of Mueller’s conclusions — that Russian interference in 2016 was real.

Much of Mueller’s evidence of this has been on public view for a year or more, contained in indictments that document how Russian intelligence agencies hacked the Democratic National Committee and how Russian trolls bombarded American voters with waves of false and divisive content on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.

Yet, recent polls show most Republicans refuse to believe the evidence. When asked whether Moscow meddled in the 2016 race, more than half of GOP voters polled said Russia did not even try.

More than anyone, Trump has stoked resistance to that objective reality. It dovetails with a cynical worldview Putin expressed in his summit with Trump in Helsinki last year, when he declared that ground truth will never be known and that, despite all the evidence, “no one is to be believed.”

Because so many American voters seem to have adopted a Putin-like cynicism, few experts believe they will be swayed by additional details in the Mueller document.

The report describes an elaborately choreographed campaign of disinformation and ma­nipu­la­tion that reached tens of millions of U.S. voters. It recruited unwitting Americans to spread divisive messages on Facebook and Twitter, with some of its posts recirculated by senior figures close to Trump, including his son, Donald Trump Jr., and national security adviser Michael Flynn.

The Mueller team, which enlisted the CIA and other U.S. spy agencies, gained such comprehensive insights into the hacking operations of Russian intelligence services that the report catalogues the cyberweapons they used to breach the defenses of the DNC, and traces how it turned the trove of stolen emails over to WikiLeaks to inflict maximum damage on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.

The chapters on Russian operations expand upon and augment the conclusions made public in 2016 and 2017 by U.S. intelligence agencies, providing evidence that is as close to irrefutable as the public is ever allowed to glimpse in the realm of espionage.

Russia’s election assault carried a more significant price than Putin may care to admit, mostly because of countermeasures imposed despite Trump’s seeming aversion to displeasing the Russian leader.

Moscow is increasingly isolated economically and politically. It has been hit with waves of economic sanctions, faces bipartisan hostility from the U.S. Congress and is flanked by European democracies erecting new defenses against Russian incursions — cyber and otherwise.

These consequences are on top of the repercussions Russia faced for its 2014 push into Ukraine. The U.S. military has ramped up the deployment of combat forces into Europe — a continent without a single American tank as recently as 2013 — while the Pentagon budget to deter Russia has grown by billions of dollars.

Every penalty for Moscow has been offset by developments that appear to advance Russia’s interests or expand its influence — gains that Putin and the 2016 operation cannot necessarily take direct credit for but have accrued like dividends.

Among them are Trump’s frequent disparagement of NATO and attacks on Western alliances, the United States’ perceived retreat from international commitments and human rights advocacy, and the extent to which domestic turmoil has diverted attention from challenges abroad.

U.S. intelligence agencies described Russia’s overriding objective in 2016 as seeking “to advance its long-standing desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order” and erode “public faith in the U.S. democratic process.”

The Mueller investigation proceeded against the backdrop of ceaseless effort by Trump to blunt the inquiry and a two-year campaign by his supporters in Congress to discredit the Justice Department, depicting as corrupt an inquiry they now say exonerates the president.

The charged climate has rendered the Russia issue so radioactive that foreign diplomats arriving in Washington have been advised by foreign policy experts at Washington think tanks to avoid even raising the subject of relations with Moscow in conversations with the Trump administration, according to a participant in one such briefing.

Although the Mueller report has answered some key questions about Russia’s interference and interactions with the Trump campaign, it was never intended to serve as a 9/11 commission-style inquiry with sweeping judgments and proposed reforms.

“We’ve never had a serious bipartisan effort to investigate and bring in the practical questions to address what do you do to make sure it never happens again,” said Andrew Weiss, a former adviser on Russia in the George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Some foreign policy experts who are more optimistic said they hope the completion of the report will enable the country to turn a corner and the president to emerge from what he once called the Russia “cloud.”

“If, in fact, it really looks like there wasn’t anything — contacts, yes, but collusion, no — in some sense, it frees the Trump administration’s hand a little bit to try to have some kind of dialogue with Russia,” said Stephen Hadley, who served as national security adviser to President George W. Bush.

“But at the same time, we have to recognize the reality of what Putin and Russia are doing,” he said. “They are weaponizing corruption and technology as tools to undermine us and undermine democracies.”
RIO — Slavoj Zizek já vai logo avisando: não sabe nada sobre o Brasil. Teme que a entrevista se concentre em torno da eleição do presidente Jair Bolsonaro — cujas plataformas o filósofo esloveno conhece apenas vagamente. Por outro lado, o comunista Zizek tem muitas opiniões sobre o mundo, da ascensão da “direita populista autoritária”, como ele chama os governos de Trump (EUA) e Salvini (Itália), aos desatinos da esquerda. “A coragem da desesperança” (Zahar), seu novo livro, fala da necessidade de mudanças radicais, para além dos fracassos do socialismo e do ressentimento populista.

Você já disse que a única coisa que o impediu de se matar foi a vontade de escrever mais livros. Ainda é o que o salva?

Naquela época, estava em uma situação desesperada, e é verdade: a teoria literalmente salvou minha vida. Ainda hoje, quando tenho crises pessoais, sei que preciso focar mais na teoria. É a minha saída particular. Não acredito em felicidade. Em nenhum lugar na constituição americana existe essa fórmula de busca pela felicidade. Sequer acho que as pessoas querem ser felizes. Se temos algo a aprender com a psicologia, é que as pessoas sempre dão um jeito de sabotar a própria felicidade. Nós, humanos, sabemos muito bem como estragar as coisas.

E por que corremos atrás delas?

Não acho que estamos felizes ao conseguir o que queremos. Quando isso acontece, nos decepcionamos. Temos que “quase” conseguir. Queremos o ouro à distância.

A felicidade é tema do seu “debate do século”. O que espera do evento?

É insano! Vamos admitir: eu não espero nada desse debate. Não por razões pessoais, mas porque acho que, mesmo quando eu e Peterson encontramos algo em comum, como a maneira como vemos a felicidade ou como criticamos o politicamente correto, ainda assim o fazemos de posições muito diferentes. Fico horrorizado em pensar o que as pessoas esperam. Meu Deus! Minha esperança é que, de alguma maneira respeitosa e amigável, pelo menos nossas diferenças fiquem claras.

Pode falar mais sobre as diferenças entre vocês?

Por exemplo, ele critica o chamado marxismo cultural, esse tipo de teoria pos-moderna. Eu também sou crítico em relação a isso. Mas o que ele chama de marxismo cultural, eu chamo simplesmente de capitalismo cultural. O fenômeno que ele descreve é um puro produto dos perigos da civilização ocidental. É tão cômico que Peterson tenha como inimigo o que ele chama de marxismo pós-moderno. Pera lá! Ele diz que o que vai destruir o estilo de vida do ocidente são ameaças externas, mas tanto o marxismo quanto o pós-modernismo são fenômenos do próprio ocidente.

A revista “New Republican” o chamou de o “filósofo mais perigoso do ocidente”...

Na mesma frase, eles também disseram que eu sou o mais desprezível de todos.

Mas você vê isso como um elogio, ser chamado de “perigoso”?

Vejo, sim, e sabe o que é interessante? Não são apenas os direitistas que me veem assim. Estou tendo muitos problemas também com algumas alas da esquerda ultimamente. Elas me veem como perigoso agora. Mas não ligo. Acabei de fazer 70 anos, não tenho nenhum problema em ficar isolado, tenho até gostado disso.

Seu novo livro traça algumas críticas à esquerda de hoje. O que ela fez de errado?

É fácil dizer que a esquerda liberal foi muito conformista, aceitou o capitalismo global, etc. Mas por acaso a esquerda mais radical tem um modelo sobre o que fazer hoje? Onde a esquerda populista, por exemplo, deu certo? Na Venezuela não foi! Na Espanha, o Podemos organizou protestos, mas nada além disso. A própria esquerda é o problema. Não aceito esse discurso de pânico “oh, o fascismo está aí, temos que nos unir contra o inimigo”. O que interessa é: de onde esse inimigo que chamam de “fascista” emergiu? Obviamente algo deu muito errado no projeto da esquerda predominantemente liberal.

O livro menciona o “ano em que agimos perigosamente”, ou seja, 2016, da eleição de Trump e do Brexit. O que ficou dele?

A situação que Trump trouxe para os EUA abriu espaço para algum radicalismo de esquerda. Se ele não tivesse vencido, não acho que haveria espaço para o que estão chamando de socialismo democrata. Temos que aceitar que esse pacto entre a esquerda e o liberalismo acabou. E a esquerda não vai vencer Trump com a nostalgia pela antigo centrismo liberal. Ela precisa ser mais radical. Filósofo diz que esquerda precisa aprender com Trump a 'quebrar as regras' Foto: Matt Carr / Getty Images

Ela pode aprender com Trump?

Deve. Não é por acaso que alguns setores da direita não queriam que Trump declarasse estado de emergência por causa dos imigrantes na fronteira. Porque eles sabem que um futuro presidente democrata poderá usar esse precedente para declarar nacional emergência por outras razões, como, por exemplo, o aquecimento global. Trump está quebrando e é isso que a esquerda precisa aprender com ele.

Quebrar as regras?

Regras nunca preenchem todo o campo legal. Regras sempre vêm acompanhadas com um conjunto entendimentos implícitos, que não estão no papel. Trump sabe como seguir as regras explícitas, mas violando as implícitas. Assim, está sempre fazendo movimentos inesperados.

É por isso que você disse, em uma entrevista polêmica às vésperas das últimas eleições presidências americanas, que Hillary Clinton era mais perigosa do que Trump? Por que isso abriria caminho para uma nova esquerda?

Por que a Hillary perdeu? De onde veio o fiasco dessa esquerda-liberal anti-racista, feminista, com mais consciência social? Como ela veio a perder o contato com as pessoas comuns? Isso é que a esquerda tem que se perguntar. Inclusive no Brasil.

No Brasil, há muitas discussões sobre se Bolsonaro deve ser chamado de “fascista” ou não. Baseado no pouco que você sabe sobre as políticas do presidente, qual a sua opinião?

Tendo a dizer que não. E sabe por que? Porque existe uma tendência geral na esquerda de chamar essa agressiva direita populista de fascista. E acho que é uma maneira fácil de evitar de pensar. Você associa com “fascismo” e acha que já sabe do que se trata. Não se aprende nada chamando Trump e Matteo Salvini de fascistas. A desprazerosa verdade é que a esquerda está fugindo de seus problemas.

O que ela deveria fazer?

Em vez de focar se é fascismo ou não, é melhor se perguntar: e se for algo diferente do que se entende por fascismo? E se for algo ainda pior? Hoje as pessoas estão revoltadas com o capitalismo financeiro, com as elites e o grande capital. Mas a verdadeira tragédia para mim é que, em muitos países, a direita populista está se apropriando dessa energia de revolta com mais habilidade.

Onde isso está acontecendo com mais força?

Olhe para os coletes amarelos na França. Certamente estão mais próximos da direita populista, e é por isso que Trump defendeu os coletes amarelos. Mas vamos parar com esse debate se são fascistas ou não e vamos para questão fundamental: o que nós, da esquerda, estamos fazendo errado? Na Europa, está muito claro: o homem comum se sentiu traído pela esquerda liberal.

A direita populista se apropria de pautas nacionalista e antiausteridade que costumavam ser da esquerda?

Sim. Na Itália, por exemplo, Salvini criou, de forma modesta, o primeiro caso na Europa de um programa de renda básica. Veja esse terrível movimento de direita que está agora na Polônia. Eles baixaram a idade da aposentadoria, deram melhores créditos para os estudantes... Não é triste e trágico que quem esteja implementando projetos que lembram a social-democracia-social tradicional sejam os populistas de direitista? É um problema, pois a esquerda está desaparecendo como fator em vários países, como França, Alemanha, Israel...

Como fã do cineasta Alfonso Cuarón, acha que ele deveria ter vencido o Oscar por “Roma”?

Eu gosto do filme, mas acho que ele ficou popular pelas razões erradas. Para mim, o filme é um retrato trágico de um personagem que não consegue se manter por conta própria. Mas ainda assim vejo como um escândalo ele ter perdido o Oscar para “Green book”. Odeio esse filme! É o que tem de pior no politicamente correto, um sanitarismo das relações raciais. Spike Lee teve toda razão em virar as costas como protesto.
Star Trek: Discovery wrapped its second season last night with an as-advertised ‘game changing’ jump to the far future, leaving Captain Pike, the Enterprise, and everyone else the from the last two years behind.

Helping to set the course for the show’s new future is series writer Michelle Paradise, who joined the Discovery team in the early part of Season 2, and is already making waves on the series as she steps up to join executive producer Alex Kurtzman as co-showrunner for the in-development Season 3, expected to arrive for viewers sometime next year.

After penning the Airiam-centric “Project Daedulus” earlier in the season, Paradise teamed up with Kurtzman co-writer Jenny Lumet to bring this year’s Discovery story to a close in the two-part “Such Sweet Sorrow” — and we caught up with her this week to talk about wrapping up Spock, those Borg parallels, Admiral Cornwell’s fate, and a whole lot more.

TREKCORE: Before we dive into the finale, could you talk a little bit about the journey that brought you to the Star Trek: Discovery team this season?

MICHELLE PARADISE: Well, I had been on The Originals for five seasons prior to this — I had done other shows before that, but I was on The Originals from day one to when that show finished up. Then I heard about this opportunity on Star Trek, which was such an amazing — I mean, what an amazing thing because I grew up watching Star Trek and to have an opportunity to write for the show was just incredible.

I came in, and I interviewed, and I got the job, which was wonderful. So I joined halfway through Season 2 and I’ve been working quite a lot with [executive producer and showrunner] Alex Kurtzman. I was working on some of the other episodes in addition to “Project Daedalus,” and then he asked me to write the finale with him and Jenny [Lumet], which was also just such an amazing experience.

We just get along really well and work very well together — and then he asked me to [be co-showrunner for Season 3]. I mean it’s the biggest no-brainer in the history of the world!

TREKCORE: Was it difficult to jump in to Discovery mid-stream, with how much of this year’s story was such a big puzzle?

PARADISE: You know it’s interesting — quite a few things, in terms of the larger mythology, were already set in motion by the time I arrived. They already had a handful of scripts by the time I came in, and some outlines [for later episodes], so they were definitely on a path.

But what was great is that there were still some larger decisions that were still being figured out — and there was a lot of the story yet to be told. Like, when I came in, Spock hadn’t even been introduced yet. We knew he was coming [later in the season] but the character itself hadn’t been introduced… so there were still quite a few larger questions to explore at that point.

Once I got up to speed on where they were [with the story], and where they wanted to go by the end of the season, I felt like I slotted in pretty quickly. And, of course, I was familiar with Season 1, so I know all of the characters, and what experiences they had had.

Being able to take all of that information and jumping into apply it to Season 2 was a really enjoyable and fun thing for me to do.

TREKCORE: Speaking of larger questions, the big mystery of the season gets answered in the finale, in that we find Burnham actually created the Red Signals to form the coalition to fight Control. How much of that final outcome was locked down at the beginning of the year, and how much came together as the episodes progressed?

PARADISE: I think it was an evolution of things — it was known from the beginning that we were going to a place where the Discovery was going to need to jump into the future.

In terms of the signals and the Red Angel, we knew that we needed to resolve all of that, what those things were specifically and how they would land, but some of that road map was still being worked out at the time I came on board.

It was really exciting to be a part of those discussions, because sometimes when you come into a show mid-season, a lot of things are already kind of set in place, and there was a lot that was already answered when I joined, but to get to be part of some of those larger discussions was really cool — because I got to the end of the season and I did feel like I had missed out on participating.

TREKCORE: Let’s get into the episode itself — Control finally gets taken down after that long fight with Georgiou and Nhan. How did you decide that magnetism, a rather low-tech solution, would be the key to stopping the advanced AI?

PARADISE: Well, by this point in the story — and we had set this up in “Through the Valley of Shadows” — the Control nanobots were known to be highly advanced, but they were still made from a metallic alloy; Spock is able to magnetize the floor on the Section 31 ship to stop the nanobots when Burnham is trying to get away from them.

We talked about how Control could essentially infect and inhabit a human form, and how the nanobots would do that — and it really just a matter of deciding what they would be made of, and how we could defeat it. So we wanted to use the thing it was made of against itself, the metal material.

TREKCORE: And it certainly gives Georgiou a hero moment for the season, after being such a villain last year…

PARADISE: Yeah, and I just have to say that the moment [where Leland is defeated], Michelle [Yeoh] just plays that character so beautifully. The moment where she’s watching him die, and she just smiled… I never cease to be delighted by that moment.

TREKCORE: As Control evolved throughout the season, some viewers started to see some similarities to one of Star Trek‘s biggest villains, the Borg; there was a lot of speculation that we were actually seeing how the Borg were created, though obviously that didn’t come to pass. Was that intentional parallel?

PARADISE: It’s interesting — we weren’t thinking Borg at all. I mean, we talked about all sorts of different things in the room, but there was never any intent on our part to parallel that in any way. I can certainly understand why people started to think we were going in that direction, but it was never where we intended to go with it.

TREKCORE: Stepping back a bit to that big three-way fight with Leland, Georgiou, and Nhan, that special rotating set to simulate the gravity failure…

PARADISE: We had lots of discussion about that rotating set – I’m very familiar with it! I missed when they were filming on that by one or two days [when I visited the sets]… they would have never let me do this, but I really wanted to go in and try it out!

We built that section of the corridor as a massive, rotating set, so you are actually seeing the actors walk up walls and ceilings as the set is rotating around them — it was just an incredible engineering and construction feat. If I remember correctly, I think that was [director Olatunde Osunsanmi’s] brainstorm. It was such an amazing idea, we couldn’t not do it. It was incredible.

TREKCORE: It’s really impressive to see something of that scale being done for television. Obviously, Discovery has a significant production budget but it’s something that generally would be done with wirework and greenscreen…

PARADISE: It really is exciting — and that kind of vision and scope, Alex drives that for the series, for every episode. His feeling, and all of ours, is that we want to blur the line between film and television. He really is a visionary in that way, encouraging us all to think like that — and to me, this finale is a perfect example.

From the rotating set to the incredible amount of visual effects in the episode — Jason Zimmerman and our VFX crew, our entire post crew and sound mixers… everybody comes together and makes that happen. Movie-quality and movie-style post work on a television schedule. That’s true of the directing, the acting… the fact that [Olatunde] accomplished what he did in this finale, on a television schedule, is amazing.

TREKCORE: Speaking of that scheduling, “Such Sweet Sorrow” was originally planned to be a one-hour finale — what lead to the decision to break it into to episodes, and expand the story?

PARADISE: We got to the end of the season, and as we were breaking the finale, we realized that to do the story justice, to do the characters justice, to answer all of the questions… it required a large story, and that just wasn’t one episode. We’re so thankful that our network partners heard that and gave us the opportunity to do it in two, because if we had tried to tell all of that in one episode, we really felt like a lot would have been left out.

We would have had to make the kinds of sacrifices that we didn’t want to make — and while the season was building to an epic finale, it wasn’t just in terms of fight sequences and battles, but an epic emotional moments too. We had to pay off the Burnham and Spock relationship, which deserved the time it got.

Plus, our bridge crew, and Captain Pike — a huge addition to the season, along with getting to see the Enterprise in all its glory… paying off that character, and all of the moments in between, we really needed the second episode. And we were very fortunate to have been given that opportunity.

TREKCORE: Before we get to the big ending, let’s do a bit of a character lighting round.

PARADISE: Yeah, sure!

TREKCORE: I have to ask, did Nhan survive that fight with Leland? The last time we saw her was face-down in the corridor…

PARADISE: Well I can’t say anything about that, but I will say that Rachael [Ancheril] is incredible. She pops in a big way, and the work that she did in the finale was absolutely wonderful. Even just watching as a fan, I loved watching her and Georgiou together, and the whole battle with Leland leading up to the rotating corridor was fantastic.

She’s been a wonderful addition — you know, she had a huge role in “Through the Valley of Shadows,” and other great moments along the way, so I’m not surprised that people have responded to her so well.

TREKCORE: You can really tell that she’s just having fun being there, which really comes across.

PARADISE: Oh yeah — and I have to say that all of our actors are like that; they’re all so supportive of one another and they really seem to enjoy being there and encouraging one another. It’s a great group of people.

TREKCORE: Well, the one character we do know the fate of is Jayne Brook’s Admiral Cornwell, who sacrificed herself to save the Enterprise. What lead to the decision to end her story?

PARADISE: It was a really difficult decision, but the thing we talked about is that you can only really tell the strength of an adversary by how they impact your heroes. As Control was getting stronger and becoming a more formidable foe, we thought about how that would impact the Discovery crew — and you saw the first casualty back in [“Project Daedalus”] with Airiam.

Once that happened, and the crew lost someone who was close to them, it put in relief how much more powerful this thing was than they expected — and to have this big battle [in the finale] and have no one die, it didn’t feel realistic.

It’s one thing to see characters that we don’t know or that we’re not familiar with lose their lives, but the real measure of how difficult the battle is — how much danger we’re in, how strong our opponent is — is if we lose someone close to us. We talked about who that might be, and we couldn’t think of a more appropriate person than Cornwell to step up and sacrifice herself for the greater good.

The way she played that moment, the strength she brought to it, Jayne just could not have been better — and having a character step up in that way, in such a crucial moment… she saves the Enterprise, so the ship can later go on with Captain Kirk, Spock, and all of those other beloved characters.

So if it had not been for her, that couldn’t have happened — so it’s not just this battle, but her place in canon is really cemented in that moment in such a big way, and we couldn’t imagine a better send-off.

TREKCORE: Rebecca Romijn’s Number One went by ‘Commander’ or simply ‘Number One’ for most of her time on-screen, but it sounded like Pike did call her ‘Una’ one time during the finale — the character’s name from the Star Trek tie-in novels. It wasn’t in the captions, so can you confirm we heard that correctly?

PARADISE: Oh yes, it was Una.

TREKCORE: There was an actor credited as ‘Yeoman Colt’ in Part 1, a character from “The Cage” – the original episode with Captain Pike – but she wasn’t called out by name that we noticed. Was she in a scene that ended up being cut, or…

PARADISE: No, she was one of the Enterprise bridge crew. We had Lt. Mann, Lt. Nicola, Lt. Amin, and Yeoman Colt.

TREKCORE: Was she the alien character with the spiked face? In the original pilot, she was a human…

PARADISE: Yes, I believe that was her. Amin was at the helm, Mann and Nicola was a bit further back, so yes, that would have been Yeoman Colt.

TREKCORE: So, this big time jump. It certainly seems to be the end of an era for Discovery, assuming the trip is as one-way as the crew believed it to be. We see the crew fly off to the far future, but the episode doesn’t follow them through the wormhole, instead sticking around in the ‘present’ to follow those left behind.

PARADISE: We absolutely wanted to wrap up the Discovery storyline for the season, to answer all the questions that were lingering for viewers: the Red Angel and signals, and Burnham and Spock’s relationship. But we also owed answers about canon, and pushing Spock’s character forward to the person he eventually becomes when he meets Captain Kirk.

As we were talking story, it felt that not following the Enterprise to see what happens next would have left way too many open questions, and we really wanted to finish answering those questions that viewers have been asking about: why has Spock never mentioned a sister, why haven’t people heard of Discovery’s spore drive.

All of these things had to be addressed to tie Discovery – the show – back in to canon, and using the last act of the show to do that, and to follow Spock’s journey, felt like the right way to go. It also allowed us to come back and see the Enterprise in all her glory, and reveal Spock [in his classic look]… it’s really the culmination of his story, and Pike’s story, and the Enterprise story.

It felt really important to do that for viewers — and for us.

TREKCORE: Spock suggests to Starfleet that everything about Discovery should get buried, classified, and hidden away to address some of those questions — but will all the time-travel elements that were part of this season, was there ever a thought to “erasing” Discovery from the timeline, or something like that, as an alternate solution?

PARADISE: You know, we talked about what the best way to handle that would be. Time travel is inherently tricky, but to us it felt that the strongest way to go was to make it a conscious choice on behalf of Spock, and Tyler, and Pike. For those to have been there, that they were choosing to keep this secret for the safety of the Federation.

Because if there are still bad elements out there, they don’t want another version of Control coming up and threatening the Federation – so to have them do it as an act of defense, an act of love, and act of courage, no matter how hard it may be…

For Tyler to never talk about Burnham again, for Spock to never talk about his sister, I mean, these are huge emotional sacrifices for these characters — and for Pike, the Discovery crew became family to him — to speak about them as if they’re dead.

Having these characters choosing to hold their secrets felt like the strongest choice, and a choice that comes from love for those people, and for the Federation. Doing anything [with time travel] to make them any less involved in that decision would have felt like we weren’t doing those characters justice.

TREKCORE: I know Discovery as a show isn’t going anywhere; you’re already hard at work on Season 3 in the writers room. How are thing going so far, as you’re getting into the next chapter of the Discovery story?

PARADISE: We are in great shape, and we have a very good sense of things, and where we’re headed. I obviously can’t say anything specifically… except about the musical episode where everyone puts on roller skates. [Laughs] That one’s not ever going to happen on the show, just to be clear!

But we’re in really good shape. We have an incredible team of actors and writers; Alex is just an amazing visionary force and we’re really excited about where we’re heading, and to let people see it whenever Season 3 comes out.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
For two long years, our news media has obsessively driven a xenophobic Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory.

Day after day, we’ve heard almost nothing but “collusion.” Didn’t matter if it was the New York Times, the Washington Post, Mother “Alex” Jones, the Atlantic, NPR, MSNBC, or CNN — our news media presented a unified conspiracy front. The Democratic Party fundraised off of it. Everyone was dead certain that “the Russians” were behind Donald Trump’s presidency. Everyone was sure that Robert Mueller’s team was going to deliver indictments showing what every spy and serious person already seemed to know was true: top Trump cronies, and probably even Trump himself, had conspired with a hostile power and engaged in all sorts of treasonous quid pro quo deals to steal the most powerful office in the world. How else could Trump have won, if not with the help of a shadowy foreign threat from the east?

And then it all came crashing down…

Now, following the meltdown of RussiaGate, some of the journalists who had critically covered RussiaGate (and there were only a handful) have been hoping that that this epic journalistic failure will serve as a teachable moment for our media establishment. Maybe mainstream journalists will finally abandon their spy-fed screeching about the “Russian threat” and focus on important issues that are impacting the lives of real Americans?

Well, I’m not that optimistic.

As I told Katie Halper, who wrote a story for FAIR about the future of RussiaGate and journalism in a post-Mueller world, I don’t see our media’s xenophobic, conspiratorial focus on Russia as a “failure” of the profession — or at least, not how most people would define the word “failure.”

Check out the FAIR story here (they even used my eugenicist James Clapper cartoon!), but here’s what I said:

The thing is that America’s media obsession with the Russian menace — this idea that Russia is the greatest threat to liberal civilization — predates the Mueller investigation. It predates the 2016 election, and it predates Trump. So this wasn’t a sudden mistake about a single investigation, but something that America’s been moving towards for over a decade. The Russian Menace has been a lucrative racket — paying the mortgages, car loans, kids’ college tuitions, for thousands of think-tankers, military contractors, academics and journalists. After Trump, the Russia hysteria hit a new level of paranoia and bigotry. There was a need to blame America’s domestic political turmoil, and the failure of its political establishment, on someone or something — to deflect responsibility for what happened. So suddenly liberal media began to see “the Russians” everywhere — part of a shadowy foreign conspiracy to undermine America from within. They weren’t just threatening Europe and NATO. They were in the White House, in American voting machines, in American electrical grids, in American children’s cartoons. They were hacking people’s minds. They were controlling both the international left and the international right—against the respectable political center. That’s how sneaky and devious and cynical they are. That’s how much they want to destroy America’s liberal democracy. The Mueller report may provide us some much-needed respite from this insanity for a few weeks or months, but this focus on the Russian menace isn’t going away any time soon. You can already see Joe Biden’s creepy behavior with women being blamed on a devious Russian plot to help elect Bernie. So as we get closer to the election, this kind of stuff is gonna fire up again big time. To treat this issue as a media problem that we “can solve” and “get right” in the future is a bit too optimistic, in my opinion. It assumes that our political and media establishment wants to actually “get it right.” What does getting it “right” mean, when they are the problem that needs to be corrected? To “get it right,” they’d have to admit that they’ve been wrong — not just about Mueller, but about the decades of bankrupt neoliberal politics they’ve been complicit in pushing on America and around the world. To get it right, our political and media elite would have to voluntarily deplatform itself. And I don’t see that happening anytime soon.

If you zoom all the way out and look at it dispassionately — as if you were analyzing the politics of someplace far away like, say, the late Romanov Dynasty — it’s easy to see how RussiaGate has been a success. It shifted blame for Trump away from a degenerate ruling elite that has presided over stunning levels of national decline and degradation onto a totally made-up, inscrutable foreign enemy.

RussiaGate’s worked, at least in the short term. It’s not going to help get Trump out of office, but that was never really the point of blaming the Russians.

PS: Right after I wrote this, as if on cue, Tim Ryan, Democratic Congressman from Ohio, launched his presidential campaign with a rallying cry to “Keep America Russisch-Frei!” The doubling down on this xenophobic conspiracy has only just begun!

R-Motorsport, making Aston Martin’s debut in the DTM this season, showed promising pace and reliability in the official pre-season tests at the Lausitzring earlier this week.

The team had two Vantage DTM race cars on track, as they continue their accelerated development and preparation programme.

All four drivers took turns behind the wheel, with Daniel Juncadella and rookie Ferdinand Habsburg on duty the first day, giving way to Paul di Resta and Jake Dennis for the last two days of testing.

R-Motorsport completed 3,610 kilometres of testing, with Jake Dennis posting the fastest lap for the Austrian outfit on Wednesday with 1:36.345, 1.1 seconds slower than Audi Sport’s Robin Frijns on the same day.

“I am impressed by the pace of development of our team,” said di Resta. “After making its racetrack debut in early March, our Aston Martin Vantage DTM has increasingly shown its potential on these test days here at the Lausitzring.”

“What especially pleases me is the consistency of the long runs. We’ve been able to learn a lot, in particular with regard to tyre wear. The handling is basically fine, and driving the new car is really fun,” added the Scot.

Juncadella was also on a high after the tests: “It is obvious that we lack some power in the engine with regards to Audi and BMW but, in other aspects, it seems that we have fewer technical problems than them, for example, with reliability. I think it was the best preparation I’ve had in all the years I’ve been in the DTM.”

“We are now better than expected, we were confident of getting the official test in good shape, but we have exceeded the expectations,” added the Spaniard.

“During the four test days at the Lausitzring, the many long runs provided us with valuable insights for the further development of our Aston Martin Vantage DTM,” said team principal Florian Kamelger. “As usual in such tests, we were able to identify and eliminate a few faults. We are very satisfied with the consistency in lap times we have achieved, bearing in mind that weren’t attempting to set fast times.”
This is a guest post by Tracy Rosenberg, executive director of Media Alliance. It was originally published on the Media Alliance website.

For the last two years (2017 and 2018) of the Urban Shield weapons expo and SWAT drill in Alameda County, I was a community observer. I went as a citizen to see how my tax dollars were being spent, and as an activist/journalist so I could describe the event to others and to the media. What I didn’t know is that in exchange the Alameda County Sheriff would access my driving record, parking tickets and legal history through CLETS, the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.

Urban Shield, as a Homeland Security-funded regional training exercise for SWAT, Fire and Emergency Services, was not open to the public, although some volunteers were solicited to role-play victims and perpetrators in the counterterrorism scenarios. So the great battle that sprung up around the event starting in 2013 with protests in Oakland dislodging the weapons expo from the Downtown Marriot, reporters getting thrown out of the event, civil disobedience outside the gates, and finally bloodied heads at a Berkeley City Council meeting debating the city’s possible withdrawal from the event, was largely waged by people who had never seen the event, but knew that militaristic training of local law enforcement wasn’t helping the growing problems with excessive use of force and the deaths of unarmed people.

When Alameda County finally got serious about debating whether the Urban Shield exercise should continue, a county task force was set up, and that task force set about gathering data, including organizing delegations of outside observers. I was a member of both of those delegations, a large one in 2017 and a smaller one in 2018. As a community observer, I was asked to register and fill out a form to produce a little badge on a rope with my name. The form included in small letters, a disclaimer that a background check would be performed.

I am a privacy advocate, so a) I noticed and b) I felt uncomfortable. In practical terms, during both of my observation periods, I was surrounded by battalions of armed officers at all times, rarely less than 2 feet from me at any given moment. During my guided tour of the SWAT practices, I was escorted by armed sheriff personnel and driven about in a sheriff SUV, much as the KGB-guided tours of the Kremlin during the days of the Soviet Union were described to me as a child. While neither I, nor my fellow observers who included attorneys, medical doctors, and religious leaders, were criminals, the slightest untoward action would have resulted in being immediately blown to smithereens.

In a memo to CLETS subscribing entities sent in April 2018, the Department of Justice reminded law enforcement agencies that CLETS was not to be used to query individuals in the media and the Automated Criminal History System (ACHS) was not to be used for licensing, employment, or certification purposes.

On April 12, Media Alliance and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a request for investigation into possible misuse of the CLETS database and a request that the agency cease all similar background checks on journalists and advocates engaged in oversight roles.

Read the letter from EFF and Media Alliance to the California Department of Justice.

Ancestry.ca, the Canadian outpost of the genealogy site Ancestry.com, has taken down an ad that was criticized for appearing to romanticize slavery. It was deemed an irresponsible retelling of an already reprehensible history.

manny (@mannyfidel) ooooh my god LMAOOO who approved this ancestry commercial??? pic.twitter.com/Isy0k4HTMA

The commercial, titled Inseparable, is a part of a Canadian ad campaign by Ancestry that tells the story of various histories cinematically. In this particular video, set presumably in the 1850s, a black woman and white man duck into a side street, where he presents her with a ring. “Abigail, we can escape to the north,” he says, eliciting her immediate skepticism. He continues: “There’s a place we can be together, across the border. Will you leave with me?” The ad ends without a clear answer, but the postscript is a mock-up of a marriage license for Abigail Williams and James Miller, dated 9 April 1857. While it is not made clear if she is a slave or a free woman of color, the portrayal does imply the couple is having a forbidden affair for the time period. It’s also not evident if the story is fictional or a retelling of an actual account.

According to iSpot.tv, the 30-second advertisement had been purchased for 90 slots before it was cancelled. Posted on Ancestry’s YouTube channel on 2 April, the commercial had only aired a few times before it was removed. After the backlash, Ancestry provided the Guardian with the following statement: “Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history. This ad was intended to represent one of those stories. We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused. We are in the process of pulling the ad from television and have removed it from YouTube.”

Anomaly, the creative agency responsible for the advertisement, previously won a Ad Age award for agency of the year in 2017. The agency declined comment, at the request of Ancestry.

Ancestry also put out an ad of a young man begging a doctor to clear him to fight in a world war, and another of a family preparing to leave Ireland due to the potato famine, all ending with: “Without you, the story stops here.” In an interview with StrategyOnline.ca, the Canada country manager of Ancestry, Bill De Groot, said he wanted to show the people of the past in a more humanistic way, saying: “They had trials and triumphs just like us.”

The ad sparked outrage after it was posted to Twitter on 18 April by several users. Desus Nice, of the comedy duo Bodega Boys, retweeted the video with the comment: “Oh y’all wildin wildin”. In a later tweet, he parodied the dialogue of the ad using a fictional account of Rosa Parks’ December 1955 arrest:

Desus Nice (@desusnice) White man: you can’t sit here!



Rosa parks: why not?



White man: because you already have a place......in my heart.

Many accused the heritage and genealogy site of romanticizing slavery and the antebellum period, noting this retelling of history is probably ahistorical and doesn’t touch on unfair power dynamics. One Twitter user pointed out black-and-white miscegenation laws were not in place in Canada at the time, but were enforced by vigilante groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.

Andray (@andraydomise) Oh for f---



This is the work of @AncestryCA.



No, Canada didn't have blatant anti-miscegenation rules on the books, but anti-miscegenation was enforced.



By the Klan. Which Canadian municipalities allowed to operate in broad daylight (when they weren't handing them charters) https://t.co/rkiPxMddek

Some surmised that the conception of the ad might have been made by a non-diverse staff, therefore not taking into account the response or implications of what an ad like this might mean.

Amy Silvers (@A_Silvers) One of the most troubling things about this is that Ancestry (and/or their agency) probably think this ad is "celebrating diversity."




Middlebury, Vt. — A chemistry professor whose exam question asked students to calculate the lethal dose of a poisonous gas used in Nazi gas chambers during the Holocaust has taken a leave of absence, Middlebury College said. The Vermont liberal arts college said that it's investigating under the terms of its faculty misconduct policy.

"This inexplicable failure of judgment trivializes one of the most horrific events in world history, violates core institutional values, and simply has no place on our campus," wrote Middlebury President Laurie Patton last week. "We expect our faculty to teach and lead with thoughtfulness, good judgment, and maturity. To say we have fallen short in this instance is an understatement."

A review of past exams given by professor Jeff Byers found a second objectionable question making reference to the Ku Klux Klan in an exam given last year. The question appeared to have a humorous intent, but "was gratuitous and offensive," the school said.

Byers apologized to the college community in an April 10 written statement on the school's website. He said he gave two exams in the last year that included questions "that were clearly offensive, hurtful, and injurious to our students."

"I can offer no explanation for my actions other than carelessness and hubris," he wrote.

The gas chamber exam question came to light in the student-run satirical newspaper, The Local Noodle, according to the student-run newspaper, The Middlebury Campus.

By now, you've probably heard about the controversial test question and the satirical article that followed. Our reporter explains and sheds new light on the situation. https://t.co/ia8I49sX75 — The Middlebury Campus (@middcampus) April 9, 2019

The preamble to the question said, "Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) is a poisonous gas, which Nazi Germany used to horrific ends in the gas chambers during The Holocaust." The question asked students to calculate the amount of HCN that would give a lethal dose in a particular size room, according to the newspaper.

The school's Community Bias Response Team, which is charged with assessing and responding to bias incidents, sent out a campuswide email criticizing both the exam question and The Local Noodle for making light of it, The Middlebury Campus reported.

An email sent to a Jewish student group and local Jewish congregation seeking comment was not immediately returned.

On Thursday, Patton, the college president, said in a campuswide email that the college has experienced several incidents of bias in recent weeks "that are causing pain and anger in our community," but did not specify what those were. She was following up on the school's decision Wednesday to cancel a lecture by conservative Polish politician Ryszard Legutko because of safety concerns, two years after the school was the site of a rowdy protest of another conservative speaker.

The Middlebury Campus reported that soon after the Nazi question controversy, another professor -- a geology teacher -- showed a cartoon in class that joked about the slave trade.
Fox has opted not to renew its sophomore drama series The Gifted for a third season. The family adventure series, set in Marvel’s X-Men universe, comes from 20th Century Fox TV, which now is part of Disney.

Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All

I hear that there have been no real conversations but there is a chance for The Gifted to find a new home within the Disney family. The show is produced by Marvel Television, which currently has series on Disney-owned Freeform and Disney-controlled Hulu. (Disney+’s Marvel series come from the company’s movie division.)

The Gifted was well received by critics, with its second season scoring even higher on Rotten Tomatoes (85% vs. 74% for Season 1.) But the drama was a soft performer in linear ratings for Fox in its second season, which wrapped in February. The Gifted‘s second season averaged a 1.1 adults 18-49 rating in Live+7, about half of its Season 1 average (2.0), and 3.3 million viewers.

Because Fox no longer has ownership in the series, linear ratings play a bigger role in the broadcast network’s renewal decisions. (Like most genre series, The Gifted does well in online viewing).

2018-19 Renewals And Cancellations For Broadcast, Cable & Streaming

The Gifted is one of two genre dramas to launch on Fox in fall 2017. The other, The Orville, also from 20th TV, is expected to be renewed.

The Gifted, from writer Matt Nix, focuses on a suburban couple (Stephen Moyer, Amy Acker) whose ordinary lives are rocked by the sudden discovery that their children possess mutant powers. Forced to go on the run from a hostile government, the family joins up with an underground network of mutants and must fight to survive. Natalie Alyn Lind and Percy Hynes White also star.

Twitch issued a temporary ban on one of its users after they used blackface makeup to cosplay an Apex Legends character.

Karina Martsinkevich, aka ‘Karupups’, was doing a live stream to around 100-200 Twitch users on the video platform on Saturday (April 14), where she used the ‘Just Chatting’ feature, meant for more casual streaming sessions, as she transformed herself into the character Lifeline.

The Lithuanian streamer donned Lifeline’s signature outfit, with a tank top, surgical mask, gloves and bandanna, even dying her hair red for the cosplay.

However, she then started to apply dark foundation to her face in an attempt to mimic the character’s skin colour.

Comicbook report Twitch ended the stream before Martsinkevich had finished, as they have a policy which prohibits the use of blackface.

This twitch streamer was cosplaying a Apex Legends character & got banned from @twitch for “Blackface” #DramaAlert pic.twitter.com/CSYZ0JrR8T — KEEM 🍿 (@KEEMSTAR) April 16, 2019

The site hasn’t commented on the issue, but they banned Martsinkevich’s account for 30 days.

The streamer spoke out about her ban in a YouTube video, where she admitted she wasn’t aware of the issue surrounding blackface, and never meant to make fun of, or hurt anyone.

You can watch it below:

Martsinkevich said:

The reason of the ban is ‘engaging in hateful conducts against a person or group of people’. On my previous stream I was cosplaying Lifeline from the Apex Legends game. I really wanted to be the same as she is, so I decided to colour my hair, to do a costume and to wear makeup; I decided to change my skin colour to a darker one. I made a mistake because I didn’t have enough information… my cosplay wasn’t meant to be painful for anyone. This is a very huge misunderstanding.

Speaking to Kotaku, she explained why she decided to do cosplay in the first place, saying:

On my stream, I wanted to show the viewers how hard is to prepare for a cosplay, how much time the make up, costume and another details can take.

Despite apologising for her use of blackface, Kotaku report Martsinkevich still shared a picture of herself in the cosplay outfit on the Russian social media app VK, even after the makeup caused her Twitch ban.

Lithuanian Twitch streamer Karina ‘Karupups’ Martsinkevich caught flak for her cosplay of Apex Legends’ Lifeline – the cosplayer’s ensemble included a generous heaping of blackface makeup, which she applied during a live broadcast in mid-April.#vicaption #twitch #twitchstreamer pic.twitter.com/WlT6iHAWZi — Vicaption (@vicaption) April 15, 2019

The caption reportedly read:

Thank you for the enormous support. Thank you for not leaving me alone in such a situation. So, guys and girls, what do you think about Cosplay?

Some of the streamer’s followers have stuck up for her, claiming as a Lithuanian she’s far removed from the history of blackface and therefore wouldn’t know why it was inappropriate.

However, hopefully the Twitch ban will serve to educate Martsinkevich about why it’s offensive, and prevent any future use of blackface.

Hello everyone! Luis “Azrael” Martinez here.



Development of Tech Tycoon is underway, and we’re very excited to share some of the challenges and solutions we’re working on. The idea behind Tech Tycoon is a simple one; a game that can be played “passively” while still finding ways to engage the player.

While the concept may seem simple enough, finding game-play mechanics that work is not a straightforward process. Rest assured: The Tech Tycoon team is hard at work making it a reality, and we’re at a point in development where we’re ready to share some of the things we’ve been working on.

Tech Tycoon: The First Prototype

As a small dev. group one of the first—and among the most important—decisions we had to make was to focus on creating, we couldn’t allow ourselves to get caught up in a single aspect of the game. As a 3D and texture artist my primary focus was designing and building a “First Level” that worked well with the mechanics that had already been programmed. Core features like the calendar system and the survey system were introduced after we already had the first office up and running in engine, we are hopping this gives us a way to easily identify game-play mechanics that work well together with the look and feel of the game.

Once we had our starting point, we began taking stock of what we had, which was a pretty bland looking office that ran the most basic mechanics of the game. Needless to say we were pretty excited! Again, we’re a small dev. group, this was big for us. After stitching various key pieces together, the thing that stood out the most was the fact that our “characters” were just “pills”.

Not terribly exciting

The Path Forward: Solidifying the Prototype

We knew that finding a style of character that would fit our concept might take some time so we decided to focus on other tasks, like finishing the various assets for the level, first. However, after one of our late night dev. sessions, I decided to mess around with some basic shapes in Maya, figuring that at least having a silhouette for the characters might not be a bad idea. As luck would have it though, what started out as an experiment ended up being the concept we decided to stick with for our characters.



“Oh my God

I LOOOOVEEEEEEE it”

-Allen “Green” Turner, after seeing the concept for the first time.

Any similarities in the uniform to a certain squadron are purely coincidental and not at all based on the personal experience of the developers.

Going in depth



So what are the reasons why we decided to use this model as a jumping off point?

Simple and clean: The mesh is simple to edit which allows us to create all sorts of looks using the base mesh as a starting point.

Universal Rigs: Because every character will be derived from the same base mesh we can stick to a universal rig, this also applies to the animations.

Limitless possibilities: Tech Tycoon will feature a massive pool of both employees to hire and manage, and customers that will visit your shop. Because they will all be derived from this base mesh we can simply tweak variables and generate different iterations of the same character.

Character Models in Engine

Looking Ahead

All the work we are doing comes from a place of passion, we are all creators and developers that have had to experience the wonder of working in retail. We want to create a fun and enjoyable way to share experiences from our time in retail and hopefully help us take our next steps into the Game Industry. We are looking forward to the challenges ahead and hope that you will continue to follow us on our journey.

I hope you all enjoyed my first developer blog! If you have any questions about the development process or have any feedback please feel free to reach out. I leave you with a little sneak peak of where we are currently at.

Muskrat Falls was billed as a strategy to meet the electricity needs of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador with environmental friendly, stable and competitively priced power.

More than six years after it was sanctioned, however, the focus now is trying to complete the project without inflicting any more pain on the province.

It's billions over budget, years behind schedule, and the subject of an ongoing commission of inquiry to determine why.

So why did things go so horribly wrong?

After months of public hearings before Justice Richard LeBlanc, the answer to that very complex question has slowly been stitched together.

And it's not a pretty picture.

Based on my own experience from attending just about every hour of testimony, I have compiled my own top five reasons why Muskrat Falls, to borrow a word from Nalcor CEO Stan Marshall, is a boondoggle:

1. Nalcor's oilmen left unchecked

A 2007 energy plan shepherded by then-premier Danny Williams identified development of the Lower Churchill as a "cornerstone public policy action."

CBC reporter Terry Roberts takes a photo of former premier Danny Williams at the Muskrat Falls inquiry. (Marie-Isabelle Rochon/Radio-Canada)

Nalcor was created to lead the effort, and former CEO Ed Martin assembled a team of men with pedigrees primarily in the oil and gas sector, leading to a culture clash with the hydro experts at Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, a Nalcor subsidiary.

Tom Marshall was Newfoundland and Labrador finance minister when the financing for Muskrat Falls was finalized in late 2013, but testified earlier this month he was not aware the cost estimate for the project had grown by $300 million. (Terry Roberts/CBC)

It's now clear Nalcor's team was given an unrestricted leash by its political masters, including what amounts to a blank cheque from the public treasury, to build the generating station at Muskrat and the transmission lines to Churchill Falls and Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula.

A parade of government witnesses have testified that they trusted the experts at Nalcor, prompting inquiry co-counsel Barry Learmonth to say government leaders were naive and blindly accepting of everything put before them.

We've heard evidence of reports being sanitized to downplay the risks of the project, of risk assessments being removed from the scope of work of at least one reviewer, and of growing frustration among bureaucrats, with one government lawyer describing Nalcor as a fiefdom and the project as a runaway train.

The Public Utilities Board, after intense public backlash, was eventually asked to review the project, but with limited terms of reference and outdated information supplied by Nalcor. The PUB was unable to draw any conclusions.

And in one of the more surreal moments at the inquiry, we learned about the confusion at the very top levels of government in late 2013 as the financing arrangement for the project was formalized.

Kathy Dunderdale was Newfoundland and Labrador's premier when the project was sanctioned in 2012, and when a federal loan guarantee was finalized a year later. (Terry Roberts/CBC)

Muskrat had been sanctioned at a cost of $6.2 billion a year earlier, but the price had grown by $300 million by the time the federal loan guarantee was concluded. But some top cabinet ministers from that era, including then-finance minister Tom Marshall, have testified they were not told of the increase, though there is documentation showing some bureaucrats were in the loop.

Then-premier Kathy Dunderdale testified she "must have known" about the higher number, and believes she was told by Martin, though she couldn't recall a specific meeting or who was in the room.

The Muskrat Falls power station and other infrastructure is seen in a recent photo provided by Nalcor Energy. As of the end of December, the power generation portion of the project had reached 92 per cent completion. (Nalcor)

There are no briefing documents or notes to clear up the confusion, since note-taking was discouraged because there was a fear of leaks, Dunderdale testified.

And while the federal government was receiving regular reports from an "independent engineer" with sometimes troubling warnings about the project, the provincial government had no such arm's-length scrutiny, and was not demanding access to the federal reports.

It's hard to argue the assertion by Learmonth that government oversight of Nalcor was "weak, feeble and limited."

2. An unrealistic cost estimate

In the world of major project construction, it's referred to as the capital cost estimate, and for Muskrat, the public was told the bill would be $6.2 billion. The fact there was another $1.2 billion for interest during construction on top of that was not talked about in the early years of the project.

There's now a mountain of evidence proving this original estimate was an impossible target.

Normand Bechard came to St. John's in the summer of 2011, believing he would be the overall project director on the Muskrat Falls project for SNC-Lavalin. But Bechard testified last month that Nalcor soon pushed him and SNC-Lavalin aside. (Terry Roberts/CBC)

It's obvious Martin and Nalcor went to extremes to keep the estimate as low as possible. I'll leave it to LeBlanc to make a finding on why this was the case.

Nalcor, for example, used a probability factor of 50 when determining its tactical contingency of $368 million, which in simple terms means there's a 50 per cent chance of overruns.

Several expert witnesses have criticized this high-risk approach for a publicly funded project, with one saying it was "bad practice."

If Nalcor had selected a higher confidence level, such as P90, it would have required a contingency of more than $1 billion, and a higher capital cost estimate.

A recommendation from a risk expert that Nalcor include a $500-million strategic risk allowance in its costs estimate was also ignored, because the province had committed to funding any cost overruns as one of the conditions of the federal loan guarantee.

So what might the public's reaction have been in 2012 if the provincial government had attempted to sanction Muskrat at a cost of $8 billion or $9 billion? And at that price, would Nova Scotia's Emera have agreed to a partnership and construction of the Maritime Link subsea cable beneath the Cabot Strait?

We'll never know the answer.

3. Nalcor knows better

In 2011, Nalcor hired Quebec engineering and construction management giant SNC-Lavalin to oversee the project. But the relationship quickly turned sour, with Nalcor eventually stripping SNC of its leadership role and establishing what's known as joint-management teams.

Witnesses for Nalcor have testified that SNC was performing poorly, while SNC witnesses have said Nalcor micro-managed the project and that SNC personnel were treated like "slaves."

These steel towers support the 1,100-kilometre Labrador-Island transmission line from Muskrat Falls to Soldiers Pond on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. (Terry Roberts/CBC)

Norman Bechard, a veteran manager of major project construction, was hired by SNC as project director.

He said he "felt useless" and said seasoned, world-class experts with the Quebec firm were replaced with personnel who lacked the proper experience for such a massive and complex project.

Bechard offered some harsh criticism of Nalcor, including its commitment to risk management.

SNC has a long history of developing hydro projects, and Bechard said he came to Labrador after leading a project for Hydro-Québec that was finished under budget and ahead of schedule.

4. Astaldi and the failed dome

The word "Astaldi" can be found 182 times in a Grant Thornton audit of the construction phase of the project.

The Italian company was awarded a $1.1-billion contract to build the powerhouse and other concrete structures at Muskrat in late 2013. It's the largest work package on the project, and Astaldi was the lowest bidder.

Very little went right for Astaldi, which had no previous experience in a northern, remote environment.

Astaldi had committed to pouring concrete year-round in aggressive amounts in order to stay on schedule, and attempted to build a heated dome over the powerhouse site in order to make that happen.

But the dome was only half-finished before it was decided to dismantle the structure. The misadventure set the project back by more than a year, and some say added up to a billion dollars to the project.

Nalcor was forced to make special payments to Astaldi of nearly $900 million, and eventually evicted the company from the project late last year.

So a contract originally estimated at $752 million by Nalcor in 2012 has now surpassed $2 billion, with the remaining work being concluded by a new contractor.

5. No geotechnical work on transmission line

Critics have alleged Muskrat was sanctioned without adequate planning, and the problems with the 1,100-kilometre Labrador-Island Link transmission line from Muskrat Falls to the Avalon Peninsula might be the best example.

A geotechnical review of the sub-surface conditions along the route was not done, and this resulted in a requirement to install many more solid — and more expensive — foundations for the steel towers than was originally budgeted.

This oversight was largely the reason why costs for the line soared by roughly $650 million.

Add it all up, and you have a project that will now cost at least $10.1 billion to build, or nearly $13 billion when interest and other charges are included.

They may have found love on The Challenge, but the real challenge for Tori Hall and Brad Fiorenza is coparenting. Tori, 32, and Brad, 38, share sons, Brady, 7, and Chase, 4, but she recently moved from Chicago to Nashville, something he is now blasting her on social media.

“Kids are not possessions, they are people. If you teach your kids to dislike one parent, even if you were raised that way, it’s like telling them they are half bad. In my opinion that is child abuse & not negotiable,” he tweeted on Wednesday, April 17. The message is currently pinned to the top of his Twitter account.

Between then and Friday, April 19, he shared multiple other messages, but never called Tori out by name. When one fan told him he has rights as a father, he responded, “It costs a lot of money to keep enforcing them. I wouldn’t wish this on anybody. I still count my blessing everyday but talk about pain.”

When multiple other followers shared their own story, he said they were “completely different situations,” before adding, “It is different when someone else quits on their family, trying to get rich off another persons ‘dads’ money in the church, then tries to blame you because they are too Christian to cheat.”

The Vendettas alum also noted that for him, it all comes down to the kids. “I just want to show my sons love & not have less than and hour contact a week. Anyone that knows my relationship w/ them can validate that. I begged her not to take them out of state. … I get them in the summer. I’m just putting lies & rumors to rest,” he tweeted on Friday. “A mother that moves sons away from a loving father and tries to convince them their dad was not there, needs to be corrected. So yeah, I want them to know I was always there and fought to keep them by me. No shame.”

He also claimed that he tried to discuss the situation with Tori privately but “it only got my kids moved out of state,” adding, “I sat on a pile of receipts from another mans wife for 2 years.”

The pair, who married in 2010 two years after meeting on MTV’s The Gauntlet III, went their separate ways in 2015 and finalized their divorce in December 2016. The former Miss Teen USA, who has not been on reality TV since 2010, responded to her ex’s claims in an exclusive comment to Us Weekly.

“When I hear of Brad saying something or tweeting irrational, I try to go to the mindset that he is hurting, and hurt people hurt people,” she shared. “I will always encourage the boys to have a relationship with their dad. Always. To say otherwise is simply untrue. I’m not operating in a place of hurt or anger, so my stance on this isn’t as emotionally driven as others. I took time to heal and deal with the divorce, and it’s made all the difference. Three years ago my response to this would have been very different.”

Tori also denied any claims of cheating. “As far as me having an affair or breaking up another family, there is no truth to that. None,” the Road Rules vet told Us. “I know people would love for this to be the case, so they could pinpoint reasoning/fault of our divorce, but it’s just not true.”

Crystal Palace’s Wayne Hennessey was accused by the Football Association of having a ‘lamentable degree of ignorance’ about Adolf Hitler and the Nazis after being charged with making an offensive gesture. Wayne Hennessey is ‘desperate’ to learn about the Nazis, says Roy Hodgson • Goalkeeper’s knowledge criticised by FA following charge

• ‘Crystal Palace and Kick It Out will sort it out,’ insists Hodgson Press Association Fri 19 Apr 2019 17.03 BST Share on Facebook

Wayne Hennessey is desperate to improve his knowledge of Hitler and Nazi Germany following the revelation he did not know what a Nazi salute was, Roy Hodgson has said.

The Crystal Palace goalkeeper was charged by the Football Association with making an offensive gesture after he was pictured with his right arm in the air and left hand above his mouth in a photograph posted on Instagram. After the charge was found not proven, the FA commission, in its written reasons, said Hennessey had showed a “lamentable degree of ignorance” about Hitler, fascism and the Nazi regime.

“We and Kick It Out work very closely together and between us I think we will be looking for a solution in the case of this one individual, but I would guess this might be a subject which goes beyond one individual,” Hodgson said. “We might be highlighting with Wayne [something] that is actually rife throughout football.

“I’ve no idea about the level of knowledge in relation to the Holocaust, the second world war, in other clubs or even in our club. It’s now something we know may well exist and will have to be dealt with.

“Together, the club and Kick It Out, we will sort it out, certainly where Wayne is concerned because he is actually very desperate now to learn as much as he can.”

The Palace manager, when asked whether he was disappointed at such a glaring gap in the 32-year-old Wales goalkeeper’s education, said: “I don’t know how disappointed one should be. It’s different to people of my generation, who are much closer to it. I don’t quite know what the young generation is learning about it.
Gobind Singh Deo poses for pictures with Les’ Copaque Production Sdn Bhd managing director Burhanuddin Md Radzi, after an agreement signing ceremony with Cultural Investment Holding Co Ltd in Kuala Lumpur April 19, 2019. — Bernama pic

KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 — Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo today urged local animation film producers to explore variations inspired by local culture that have universal values to penetrate the international market.

He said this would be good to sell Malaysia’s image on the world stage.

“With the animation and visual effects (VFX) industry a global commodity with a turnover of US$259 billion in 2018 and expected to exceed US$270 billion in 2020, we should continue to beef up the local animation industry to be a creative economy juggernaut,” he said when officiating an agreement signing ceremony between Les’ Copaque Production Sdn Bhd and Cultural Investment Holding Co Ltd.

At the same time, Gobind said the talent of young people in the local animation industry should continue to be nurtured by agencies like the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (Finas) and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation through incubation and skills development programmes.

He said this was because employment opportunities in the industry had expanded, with export of local animation products totalling RM132 million last year.

In the meantime, Gobind said, Les’ Copaque’s efforts through its film, Upin & Ipin: Keris Siamang Tunggal had successfully penetrated the China market in a strategic move by taking into account the cinema market factor in the country that would overtake the United States by 2022.

“The Upin and Ipin brand, which has become a phenomenon should also be praised for its intellectual property rights and copyrights held by the producer so that the product can be licensed through various platforms worldwide,” he said.

Furthermore, he said as China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner and leading investor in the country, this initiative has yielded economic benefits, including via the creative industry particularly in the film industry.

“The mutual understanding between Les’ Copaque and Cultural Investment Holding reflects the commitment by both countries’ filmmakers to strengthen cooperation and deepen cultural exchanges,” he said.

Meanwhile, Les’ Copaque Production Sdn Bhd managing director Burhanuddin Md Radzi said the movie, Upin & Ipin: Keris Siamang Tunggal, costing almost RM20 million, is expected to be screened in cinemas in China this June or July, and dubbed in Mandarin.

He said via the agreement, the Cultural Investment Holding Co Ltd would bear the cost of promotion of the movie in China amounting to RM6 million.

In addition, Burhanuddin said the latest movie would also be aired in cinemas in Vietnam on April 26 and in Indonesia on May 9.

This latest film produced by Les’ Copaque has collected more than RM25 million at the local box-office with over two million viewers, recording the highest collection of all time for the animated film category in Malaysia. — Bernama
The UFC has set dates for three international cards in August, September and November, sources told MMA Fighting.

On Aug. 10, the company will make its first trip to Uruguay with a Fight Night event in Montevideo. That will mark the third UFC card in a South American country — outside of Brazil — following 2018 events in Chile, headlined by Kamaru Usman vs. Demian Maia, and an Argentina show featuring Santiago Ponzinibbio vs. Neil Magny.

The UFC has selected the Sept. 7 date for a pay-per-view event, sources said. The current plan, according to lightweight king Khabib Nurmagomedov, is to have that show take place in Abu Dhabi. If all goes right, Nurmagomedov would unify the 155-pound belt against interim champion Dustin Poirier on that date.

The Octagon has arrived twice before in Abu Dhabi. The first with a pay-per-view card, with UFC 112 taking place in April 2010 with Anderson Silva and B.J. Penn putting their titles on the line against Demian Maia and Frankie Edgar, respectively. Four years later, a Fight Night card was headlined by Roy Nelson vs. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira.

With a pay-per-view event scheduled for May 11 in Rio de Janeiro, the UFC will make its final 2019 trip to Brazil on Nov. 16, in Sao Paulo. The Ibirapuera Gymnasium held UFC Fight Nights events every year since 2013, and could feature the retirement bout of former featherweight champion Jose Aldo.
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tried to do damage control on her credibility Friday, insisting that she hadn’t intentionally misled the American public about FBI Director James Comey’s firing despite telling the special counsel that her claim that “countless” agents had lost confidence in him was not founded on anything.

Sanders, who told special counsel Robert Mueller that her comment during a White House press briefing in May 2017 had been a “slip of the tongue” made in the “heat of the moment,” claimed in a series of television interviews that the sentiment behind her words — that many rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey and contacted the White House to say so — remained true.

“If you look at what I said, I said the ‘slip of the tongue’ was in using the word ‘countless,’ but there were a number of FBI, both former and current, that agreed with the president’s decision, and they’ve continued to speak out and say that and send notice to the White House of that agreement with the president’s decision,” she said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

“I said that it was in the heat of the moment, meaning it wasn’t a scripted thing,” she added on “CBS This Morning.” ″But the big takeaway here is that the sentiment is 100% accurate.”

Sanders is among scores of current and former White House officials who were interviewed by Mueller’s team during the nearly two-year investigation that examined whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election and whether the president tried to interfere with the inquiry.

Mueller concluded his investigation last month and Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version of the special counsel’s report on Thursday. Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy between the campaign and Russia but also made no clear verdict on the question of obstruction.

A section of the report that references Comey’s firing by Trump notes Sanders telling reporters that the White House had heard from “countless” FBI agents who had lost confidence in Comey’s ability to lead the bureau. She dug in when a reporter pushed back, asking, “I mean, really?”

“Between like email, text messages, absolutely,” she responded, claiming that there had been at least 50 contacts.

But Mueller’s report found that the “evidence does not support those claims.”

“The President told Comey at their January 27 dinner that ‘the people of the FBI really like (him),’ no evidence suggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything,” the report said.

Sanders, who spoke to Mueller’s investigators under oath, told them her use of the word “countless” was a “slip of the tongue.”

“I’m sorry that I wasn’t a robot like the Democrat Party that went out for 2½ years and stated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign, that they had evidence to show it and that the president and his team deserved to be in jail, that he shouldn’t be in office when, really, they were the ones that were creating the greatest scandal in the history of our country,” Sanders said on ABC.

This isn’t the first instance in which the credibility of Sanders, who speaks for the White House and is paid by American taxpayers, has come under scrutiny.

She faced similar questions last year after Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, surprised the White House by saying on national TV that Trump had reimbursed his then-fixer Michael Cohen for the $130,000 Cohen had paid porn actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign to keep quiet about an alleged past sexual encounter with Trump. Trump has denied Daniels’ claim.

The White House had failed to disclose the reimbursement. Sanders said she didn’t know anything about the repayment until Giuliani disclosed it.

At least one publisher said the credibility problems that existed for Sanders before Mueller’s report have worsened after it.

“This now documented, on-the-record, under-oath episode, I think it completely obliterates her credibility,” said Kyle Pope, editor-in-chief and publisher of Columbia Journalism Review. “I remember watching and thinking there is no way countless FBI people called up Sarah Sanders. It stretched credulity just on its face.”

Pope said the episodes raise questions about why any reporter would attend Sanders’ briefings, which she has scaled back from daily to about monthly, or “put stock” in what she says.

Frank Sesno, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University, said credibility is the only currency a press secretary has to offer.

“When you throw it overboard or devalue it, you do so at your own peril. I think that Sarah has a lot of explaining to do, which should be done forthrightly and honestly about the disparity in her comment,” said Sesno, a former White House correspondent for CNN.

Sesno continued: “The public and the media expect partisans and press secretaries to spin,” or attempt to put a rosier face on less-than-flattering situations. “They don’t expect them to lie. If you’re caught in a lie, you should acknowledge it and figure out whether you can repair your reputation.”

As jubilant Republicans celebrate their vindication following the release of the 448-page redacted Mueller report, Democrats are pushing ahead with their crusade to find something, anything, they can use against Trump by subpoenaing the unredacted report and the underlying evidence from the investigation, the Washington Post reports.

The subpoenas were issued Friday morning by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler.

The decision comes after the committee voted to authorize Nadler to issue the subpoenas earlier this month.

Earlier, Trump slammed certain allegations about things he purportedly said or did that were included in the report as 'total bullshit.'

Nadler was singing a different tune in 1998 when the Clinton report was finished, however - advocating for redactions "as a matter of decency and protecting people's privacy rights."

Rep. Jerry Nadler wants to see the full Mueller report, exactly the opposite of what he said in 1998 when the Clinton report was finished 🤷‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Z62JPV9iu4 — Wojciech Pawelczyk 🇵🇱 (@PolishPatriotTM) April 2, 2019

Because some of the materials being subpoenaed involve grand jury materials, which can only be released with permission from a judge, and material being used in ongoing investigations, the Dems' subpoenas might spark a legal battle that ultimately be decided by the US Supreme Court. "The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct," has argued, adding that "Congress is entitled to all of the evidence."

The subpoenas will hopefully (for the Dems' sake) distract from the wholesale 180-degree-turn that Congressional leaders like Adam Schiff have made, pivoting from Trump's behavior was unquestionably illegal to simply raising questions about unethical behavior.

Adam Schiff on Mueller report: "Whether these acts are criminal or not, whether the obstruction of justice was criminal or not or whether these contacts were sufficiently illicit ... they are unquestionably dishonest, unethical, immoral and unpatriotic" https://t.co/IiXmNES8Vq pic.twitter.com/BwtudbBZul — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 18, 2019

And keep in mind: Despite the leadership's earlier insistence that there's no point in impeaching Trump so close to an election, once the full report is in their hands, 'all options' will be on the table.
Sharper screens and better cameras have not been enough for people to upgrade their phones. Consumers are holding on to phones longer than ever before – up to 4 years according to a Bernstein report from February – and smartphone shipments are down across the globe to levels not seen since 2014.

That means companies like Samsung and Apple are looking for new ways to attract phone buyers.

The Galaxy Fold is a $1,980 example of a new form factor that might get people to care about new phones again... eventually.

Samsung has a history of driving the smartphone market forward with new form factors. People once gawked at the Galaxy Note for having a 5.3-inch screen, which seemed gigantic at the time. But it ushered in a new era of large phones that have been adopted by every phone maker on the planet.

As a major supplier of screen technology, Samsung's foldable displays are likely to be used in millions of devices in the coming years. And while I can't recommend it today, it could give you a taste of the future standard as prices drop.

Here's what I learned.

Animorphs #48: “The Return”

Publishing Info: Scholastic Paperbacks, December 2000

Where Did I Get this Book: own it!

Book Description: David, the “sixth Animorph,” is back. When the Animorphs and Ax decided to give another human being the power to morph, it was one of their biggest mistakes. David tried to destroy all of them–and almost succeeded. Rachel and the others thought they’d seen the last of him.

They were wrong.

Rachel knows what a threat David is. He’s cunning and dangerous. Worst of all, he knows their secrets. Now he’s captured Rachel as part of his plan to take over everything. David wants power. Money. But more than anything, he wants revenge.

Narrator: Rachel

Plot: Again, for 90% of this book I was banging my head against a wall at the sheer waste of the very last Rachel book we’re going to get. There’s a strong argument to be made that, other than Jake, Rachel has the most interesting over-arching story line throughout the series. And then, in the last book before we lose her for good, we get this. Dream sequences within dream sequences. A return to the crazy Rachel who wants to fight Jake for leadership. A bizarre Crayak appearance that comes with the worst “morph” (and cover art) ever. And then, at the very end, some truly good stuff about Rachel’s role on the team and how the others view (and use) her. But we’ll save that for just a few throwaway pages at the very end, just to really rub it in your face that there was in fact good stuff to be had here. But we had to get those dream sequences in, you know?! Priorities.

Rachel and the other Animorphs are on a school field trip to the White House when the Yeerks attack, leading with a shot that takes out Tobias. Enraged and assuming that the Yeerks are now going on the open offensive, so they might as well too, Rachel and the others go into their battle morphs. Grizzly!Rachel begins taking out Hork Bajir, but takes a lot of hits while she’s at it. Gorilla!Marco pulls her back and tiger!Jake orders her to stand down; that she’s taken too much damage and is out of control. This enrages Rachel and she decides that she’s done taking orders from Jake and it’s time for them to fight it out for leadership of the group. They fight, but Rachel continues to take too much damage, slowly bleeding out in front of the White House, only to wake up, drenched in sweat in her bed.

Later, Rachel is visiting Ax and Marco in Ax’s scoop in the woods after failing to find Cassie in her barn. Rachel is concerned about the repeated nightmares she’s been having of fighting Jake, one-on-one. On the Internet, the discover a first hand account of the attack on the battle carrier. Rachel expresses her excitement that the war will finally be out in the open. Marco and Ax are both concerned about this level of enthusiasm from Rachel, and she begins to feel ashamed herself. Marco goes on to explain that if the war does come out into the open, the Animorphs are finished.

Eagle!Rachel flies back towards home with Tobias. On the way, they get into another discussion about Rachel’s enthusiasm about the war, with Tobias pointing out that she was beginning to disturb everyone with her attitude. Rachel once again starts down the “Jake is threatened by me” mentality that we are all so familiar with and loved back in the “Rachel is the leader” book. As she ponders this, she almost hits an electrical wire before, again, waking from her dream.

Awake, Rachel is disturbed by her dreams and reflects on the David incident, one of the most extreme examples of her past ruthlessness, but also an example of when the hard thing had to be done and the fact that while the plan ad been Cassie’s, Rachel was the one who had to actually follow through with it.

At school, she sees Jake in the halls and feels that his nod of greeting is more cold than usual. She worries that she is still in another dream, feeling disturbed and as if something is wrong with the world. In class, she begins to see red flashes and thinks she hears rats in the wall, crying out for help. She skips the rest of school and sends a note to Cassie to meet her at Cassie’s barn. When she arrives, she sees Cassie run out, pursued by a mass of rats that being attacking her as she tries to morph. The rats come after Rachel too and she tries to escape them by jumping in a pond. But once there, she is grabbed by something beneath and almost drowns.

She wakes up in some type of dungeon/sewer location, trapped within a hard, plastic cube. Two thugs show up and one pulls out rat!David. David tells her of the horrors of living on the rock island, but explains that, because he’s so smart, he was able to recruit a few of the “smarter” rats as lieutenants and then sneak off the island on a boat brought in by a group of naturalists. Once on the mainland, he was able to recruit another 200 or so rats to his “cause” and, being able to get into small places, like banks, gather the funds to pay off thugs like the two in the sewer with them.

The two get into a conversation where David tries to manipulate Rachel into taking all of the blame for what happened to him and gas-lighting her into thinking he was an innocent victim. For his revenge, he wants to force Rachel to morph rat and become stuck, like him. The red light returns and reveals another corner of the room where Cassie is being held prisoner in similar cube. David says he’ll let her suffocate in the cube if Rachel doesn’t morph. To buy time, Rachel does as he asks, hoping to still find an out. As she tries to think of a way out of the situation, David continues to prod at her about her role on the team. He also reveals that he has a solution to the Yeerk problem: wipe out the humans on Earth with a plague, then the Yeerks have no reason to be here anymore. As David talks, his voice starts to sound strange. He continues to manipulate her, almost hypnotizing her into agreeing that without Jake, Rachel could be in charge and wouldn’t that just be better?

The red glow returns and reveals itself to be an eye. Rachel snaps out of it and realizes that David can’t have an army of rats, they aren’t smart enough for that. And thus nothing that has happened can be real, like her and Cassie being attacked by rats. In the cube, “Cassie” turns into the Drode, and Rachel realizes that the red haze/eye is Crayak. She also realizes that Crayak’s hatred of Jake has been behind her strange dreams, setting Rachel up to hurt him. David, it turns out, is also only working for Crayak.

Crayak tells Rachel that she needs to free herself from herself and magically pops her out of her cage and into a giant, warrior version of herself with claws for fingernails. She is able to transform to and from this form at will, and begins to revel in the power it offers. She tries to attack the Drode, but everything is an illusion. Crayak transforms her back into a rat, now trapped in her cube with David. She gets in a fight with David, but he has more experience as a rat. Just when she is beginning to lose, Crayak pops her back out and into human form. She transforms back into Super-Rachel. He tempts her with thoughts of the power she could have in this form, able to take out the Yeerk force all on her own. Then pops her back into the cage with David, a rat again. The contrast starts to drive Rachel crazy.

Back in Super-Rachel form, Crayak lays out what he wants: she can retain this form and power if she kills Jake. Rachel refuses, telling herself that she is one of the good guys. To push Rachel further, Crayak somehow snaps Visser One/Three into the room. Crayak tells Visser One that he is now involved in a fight to the death with Rachel. If Visser One wins, he gets Earth; if he loses, he and the Yeerks must retreat.

They fight. Rachel is able to instantly morph to any of her forms, including Super-Rachel. When Visser One morphs some type of sentient goo that Rachel can’t fight, she discovers that she can create morphs, essentially, turning into a killer plant of her own imagination. Even after Visser One beheads her, Rachel is able to quickly reform herself. Rachel prepares to kill Visser One. But as Crayak urges her onward, she begins to reflect on Super-Rachel and how the world and the other Animorphs would see her: not as a someone to be honored and respected, but someone to be feared and hated. She releases Visser One, repeating that she is one of the good guys.

Back in the cube, back as a rat, Rachel begins to despair, not sure what is real and what is not. Crayak and the Drode disappear, leaving rat!Rachel with minutes before she is trapped as a rat and with Cassie, back trapped in her airless cube. She remembers the two thugs, and quickly calls out to them, highlighting the crappy situation of working for a talking rat like David. She promises that if they let her out, she will find the money David had promised them and they’ll be free of him. They let her out and she morphs grizzly and scares them off while David scampers away. As they run off, Rachel realizes that eventually they’ll talk and a Controller will realize that there’s a rat out there who knows all about the “Andalite bandits.” She releases Cassie and tells her to go on ahead, that she still has something to do, to return David to the island. Cassie tries to stop her, and Rachel gets angry, saying that Cassie knows what needs to be done, and can she do it herself? When Cassie hesitates and says she doesn’t know, the matter is settled.

She catches up with David, who is sitting staring at the sun; he doesn’t run when she approaches. He tells her he’d rather die than go back to the island. When she tells him that she can’t kill him, that she’s one of the good guys, he replies that she should do the “good thing” and put him out of his misery. Horrified, Rachel tries to tell him to just run away and promise never to tell anyone about them. David laughs a manic laugh and calls her a fool. Despite herself, she feels sorry for him and sorry for herself that they are in this situation. Rachel sets him down and cries, half hoping that he’ll just run away and spare her the decision. But he doesn’t. He repeats that if she is one of the good guys, she’ll do the right thing and kill him. But Rachel doesn’t know what the right thing to do is, so she sits there, a teenage girl in an alley staring at a white rat.

Xena, Warrior Princess: As far as Rachel’s character goes, I feel like we only really get into it towards the last third of this book. There’s a horrible return to the power-hungry Rachel who has some type of grudge against Jake for the first half to two-thirds and I don’t really want to even bother going into my feelings on that yet again (instead I’ll do it in the Jake section next!)

Instead, I wish the story had focused on the David stuff the entire time as there is plenty of character stuff to mine there. Not only do Rachel’s actions in the David trilogy play a big role in her relationship with Jake, but we also see how Rachel’s view of Cassie has been affected by that group of books as well.

I really liked effect had by the repeated mantra of “I’m one of the good guys” and then the heart-braking pay off for that phrase in the end when David asks her to kill him, saying that that would be the “good” thing to do. Crayak mentions that good and evil are only simple to the small-minded (deep burn to Cassie!) and it’s another great payoff that we see that thought in action with Rachel’s decisions at the end of this book. What is the good ting to do?

I also really liked her reflections on her role in the team, once she settles upon the symbiotic nature of the relationship.

I looked at Cassie’s face. It was a sweet face. It was wise, too. But still…I don’t know…oddly innocent somehow. I’d been protecting her. Them. Jake. Cassie. Tobias. Even Marco and Ax. Helping to protect their innocence. Letting them see themselves as the good guys. It was a symbiotic relationship. Or co-dependent, whatever. They needed me to be the bad guy. And I needed them to be the good guys. See, if they were good guys, and I was on their team, then that automatically made me a good guy, too. Even if I was different.

For all of the book’s flaws, I’m really glad that this part came out of this story. It’s essentially the conclusion and thesis to Rachel as a character throughout the entire series. It’s just excellent all around. If only it had come in a book that didn’t have a god awful cover of Rachel morphing some mutated version of herself. *sigh*

Our Fearless Leader: It’s unfortunate to see a return to the “Rachel is jealous of Jake’s leadership role” take again in a Rachel book. While the later explanation by Crayak that his goal in recruiting Rachel is to take out Jake, it still seems to play off the idea that Rachel, on her own, still covets the leadership role and harbors some type of violent inclinations towards Jake. It was hard to swallow this the first time and having it reappear doesn’t really improve things. Since that book, again, we’ve seen no evidence that Rachel covets the leadership role, that the other Animorphs would ever accept her as the next in line for leadership, or that any of this type of tension lies at the heart of Rachel and Jake’s relationship. Given where the book ends up in the last third, with Rachel’s realization/acceptance of the role she plays in the team, especially when connected to David, there were a lot more interesting routes that could have been taken with her relationship with Jake given his and Rachel’s interactions back during the David trilogy. And when you know where the series is headed with Jake’s use of Rachel…I just feel like there were a lot better options to explore there than some weird jealously/leadership angle that has never made sense.

A Hawk’s Life: Tobias isn’t even in this book in reality, only in a dream sequence.

Peace, Love, and Animals: You have to wonder whether Rachel and Cassie talk more about this after the fact. And, as I’ll get to in the “crazy plans” section, like David, I’m not sure why real Cassie had to be involved in any of this either. But it’s good that she was, because, again, the end of the book had some good stuff between her and Rachel as Rachel is understand truly where she stands. Rachel thinks repeatedly about the fact that Cassie was the one who came up with the plan to trap David (ironic, since earlier in this book, David mentions that he would have picked Cassie as a companion because she was nice to him, but he didn’t want to torture her with being a rat, so he chose Rachel. If only he had know who the ultimate mastermind of his fate had been!) but how Rachel was the one who had to suffer actually executing it. There’s also this great interaction at the very end when Rachel is having to go after David once again to return him to the island:

“I don’t think you can do it a second time,” Cassie said quietly. I felt all the old anger bubbling up. Why was she arguing? She knew what had to be done. Why was she pretending not to understand what had to be done? So she could sleep at night? So she could say “I tried to stop her, so it’s not my fault?” so she could say “I didn’t know.” I looked her in the eye. <I’m not sure I can, either. So will you do it?> Cassie’s face creased. Her mouth opened and closed. Her eyes flickered.“I don’t know,” she whispered finally. <I didn’t think so.>

It really highlights how even Rachel’s best friend is willing to let Rachel suffer the brunt of these kinds of things. And Rachel’s right, it’s worse because Cassie and the others often do things like this, use Rachel to do the dirty work and then judge her for it. The symbiotic relationship Rachel references feels a bit uneven at that point. It’s one thing for Rachel to do the dirty work to be one of the good guys, and the others to let her, so that she’s the bad guy. But then taking the extra time/breath to judge her for it, that’s tipping the balance towards the others being in the wrong ultimately. Rachel’s essentially paying a double price at that point.

The Comic Relief: Marco, too, isn’t in this, other than the dream sequence. Though his contributions in the dream conversation hold pretty true to the Marco we know. He’s also the example Rachel uses in her discussion with Tobias about why one bad behavior in the group (Marco’s whining) is tolerated but her gung-ho-ness is not. I’m not sure about this comparison, but, again, it’s a dream sequence so probably not worth over-analyzing it.

E.T./Ax Phone Home: Ax is only in this in the dream sequence, and even there he doesn’t contribute much.

Best (?) Body Horror Moment: I mean, the most horrifying part of this book is the cover. Full stop. Super!Rachel is such a stupid idea. She ends up having unlimited morphing abilities as it is in the fight with Visser One, able to morph instantly and create imaginary morphs. There’s no reason to have some steroid version of herself included too. It’s just stupid and a truly unfortunate choice to include as the cover. If readers weren’t already jumping ship off this series at this point, I’m pretty sure showing up at the bookstore and seeing this cover might have been the death knell for a good number of people.

Couples Watch!: Man, I can’t emphasize enough just how disappointing this book is on this front, considering it’s the last Rachel book we have in the series. The past few Rachel books have been disappointing in this arena for the most part too, and it’s really unfortunate as it felt like at one point about halfway through the series this relationship was going somewhere interesting with the whole “Rachel is frustrated with Tobias’s choice to remain a hawk” thing. But then that whole plot point was just dropped all together pretty much. And the only interactions we get in this book are during a dream sequence that Crayak creates and in which Tobias is again mostly a jerk towards Rachel. What made them an interesting pair was their ability to understand the choices the other made, choices that were often hard for the main group to understand. Rachel can appreciate Tobias’s commitment to the war, and Tobias has his own ruthless streak to match Rachel’s (again, remember that he is ultimately the decider behind the destruction of an entire alien race back in Megamorphs #2). So yeah, it’s a bummer that we’re left out in the cold here. There’s some good David stuff in this book, but I can’t help but be disappointed that in Rachel’s last book we get more on her relationship with psycho David than with Tobias.

If Only Visser Three had Mustache to Twirl: There are essentially three villains in this book: Visser One, Crayak, and David. Visser One only shows up for the brief battle royale and you have to imagine how confusing this whole thing is to him. He tries to get arrogant/snippy with Crayak initially but quickly seems to realize he’s outmatched. And then he lucks out that Rachel has a crisis of conscience at the very end or he would have been a goner.

As for Crayak, he’s again kind of just a nebulous, Sauron-like bad guy with a fixation on Jake. Frankly, other than the “Ellimist” book, the Drode has been the more interesting villain from this group and I think the story might have read better with him and his snark taking point, rather than the pretty cheesy “master villain” vibe that Crayak had going for him.

David is by far the most interesting villain in this story. I’ll get into why it’s weird that he’s here at all a bit later, but regardless of whether it makes sense, I’m glad they included him since the best parts of the book were at the end when Rachel was having to deal with him. He’s pretty interesting throughout this story. We see the full scope of crazy!David, from his extreme egomania, to his the cowardice at the heart of him, to his deranged sense of being wronged and the extremes that he will go to to fight back, to the part that is still a human boy who is living through hell. I’m not convinced that David ever had to come back, but since he did, I would have rather had the entire book deal with him and the fallout from the events back in the David trilogy. Crayak and Visser One just seem kind of ridiculous in comparison to some of the pretty heavy stuff that comes to play with the David sections of the story.

Adult Ugly Crying at a Middle Grade Book: The end of the book definitely got to me. Not only does Rachel begin to feel bad for David, but the reader does too. There are just some really powerful lines and images dropped in there. Like when Rachel first comes across David again after chasing him down and she describes him as standing up on this back legs, facing the sun and delicately waving his paws around to appreciate his freedom and the world. And his pleas that Rachel kill him, that ultimately that is what a “good” person would do, all things considered. And the line, of a girl crying in an alley, staring at a white rat. It really hits home how terrible this situation is and that, regardless of all of this, Rachel is still a teenage girl faced with terrible choices. And choices that her friends have left her to make on her own.

What a Terrible Plan, Guys!: Crayak’s plan to try and turn Rachel on Jake seems overly complex. I’m not sure why David had to be involved at all really? The threat to trap her as a rat with references to her past ruthlessness with David would probably have been just as effective without him. Or, as we see throughout this book, Crayak is perfectly able to create illusions, so the real David was never necessary to the actual plan. And then why David had to have a plan of his own with two actual human thugs to carry it out? What benefit did this have for Crayak other than introducing points of failure to his plan which then…did fail because of them! If those thugs hadn’t been there, and David hadn’t been there, Rachel and Cassie would be done for. I guess maybe this would have been against the “rules” in Crayak and the Ellimist’s game. But the rules are pretty hard to really understand as it is, so I’m not sure that’s a good enough reason for the overly complex nature of this all.

Favorite Quote:

This is a long quote, but it sums up a lot of good stuff from this book and Rachel’s realizations about where she fits in the team. The biggest frustration for me, the reader, a Rachel fan, is the fact that Rachel has realized things like this a few times, but the other members of the group never seem to realize the same thing: that they need Rachel to do these things and that they are foisting a burden on her and the least they could do is keep quiet instead of shaming her further.

I looked into Cassie’s eyes. Did she want to know? Did she really want to know? No. she didn’t. That’s why I’d been so angry. Not just at Jake. At all of them. Because they had kept their hands clean. They had pretended they didn’t know I’d done something extreme like threaten to kill David. And his parents.And when David had confronted them with the truth, they’d made their disapproval known. Separated themselves from me. Made it clear I was deranged and out of control and so, so unlike them. And then, Cassie had come up with the plan to trap David in morph. But only I’d had the nerve to endure the two gut-wrenching hours of David’s misery.Why hadn’t I fought back? Defended myself against accusations, insinuations of craziness? Okay, I’d confronted Jake. But had anything really changed between us since then? Did he generally approve of my actions? No. Only of their results. He needed my results.

Scorecard: Yeerks 13, Animorphs 16

No change! Nothing really happens in this book and there aren’t any long-standing changes to the overall war effort on either side.

Rating: So, as evidenced by the gif at the beginning and my thoughts throughout, I had a very mixed response to this book. I think the inclusion of Crayak was questionable (and his plan was idiotic), and that the dream sequences were a waste of precious page space in Rachel’s last book. But I also think that the last third of the book dealing with David and Rachel’s realizations about her role on the team and how the others have treated her is crucial character development for her before the final chapter in the series. Other than the obvious end of the series, I think this book highlights why Rachel is one of the more tragic characters in the series. Tobias obviously has the roughest go of it, but I think Rachel might even beat out Jake. Jake at least gets some of the respect that comes with being a leader and the hard choices that come with that. We see in every other Animorphs book how much the others respect and recognize the burden Jake takes on in this role. Rachel, on the other hand, plays an equally important role, and the others use her for it knowingly, but she also gets only derision and shame for doing these hard things.

I also have mixed feelings on the end. I’m not sure if I like or dislike the fact that it doesn’t resolve Rachel’s choice about David. In some ways, it feels like the same type of cop-out that the Animorphs themselves take: leave it up to Rachel. But here, the author just side-steps the whole terrible choice by leaving it unanswered. So yes, on one hand you have the interesting situation where each reader can decide for themselves what Rachel did (or they would do in her place). But it also seems to avoid answering the main question of the entire book and Rachel’s arc throughout the series: what is the “good” thing to do vs. the necessary? And the fact that there really isn’t an answer to that question doesn’t mean that people/characters don’t still have to ultimately decide. Rachel can’t sit in the alley forever.

I do think the last lines of the book is one of the more beautiful endings of any book in the series, however. So I’m torn on whether I’d want to lose that in exchange for some more resolution.

I caught a glimpse of myself in a broken shard of mirror. And saw what anyone looking down the alleyway from the sidewalk would have seen. A young girl sitting knees-up in the sun, staring at a white rat. It would be hard to believe the entire fat of the planet depended on that girl. A girl who wanted to do the right thing. But who had no idea at all what that was…

Note: I’m not going to rate these books since I can’t be objective at all!


It was an extremely busy week for this author. The Masters was a masterful four-day event that saw the Tiger comeback win him his money back in the FanDuel MEGA Eagle tournament (thank you, Jesus). The NBA and NHL playoffs are in full swing and have seen some crazy underdogs win road games and series. And, I watched my first episode of Game of Thrones.

Yep – the first one I’ve ever watched is Season 8, Episode 1. You should’ve seen the look on my coworkers’ faces when I asked them what the ‘weird blue eyes’ meant. I’ve also decided to suspend my Season 8 viewing and go back to the beginning now. Have I already encountered too many spoilers? Hopefully not.

To cap off the week, I was able to dig into some minor league data and map out some Double-A and collegiate games to attend to do some fantasy scouting. How fun is that? I’m looking to keep this sportstacular month of April going with some live looks that I can share in this weekly prospect report.

But enough about my antics – let’s catch up on some minor league action through the first two weeks!

Touki Toussaint, SP, Atlanta Braves

It’s finally Touki time! As a Braves fan, we are on a first-name basis. No, this has nothing to do with my brain always wanting to put the ‘i’ in his last name after the ‘u’. Does that happen to anyone else?

Anyway, Touki was able to force his way back into the rotation after a masterful performance in relief of Sean Newcomb. The latter could not get out of the third inning and the former took it from there. In fact, the Braves went as far as to send Newcomb down to work on his control issues. Shocker. Now, Touki gets a chance this weekend to prove his worth with a start against the Indians. By the way, that makes him a viable starting option off of the waiver wire.

As with all Atlanta arms other than Mike Foltynewicz (upon return), there’s always the possibility of getting demoted or relegated to the bullpen. With Max Fried pitching well and Julio Teheran and Kevin Gausman getting the veteran treatment, that fifth spot is turning into a game of musical chairs. This week, Touki found the lucky seat, but who will it be next? Newcomb, Bryse Wilson, and Kyle Wright (mentioned later) will require a few starts at Triple-A. However, it’s Mike Soroka, who also joins the rotation this week, that worries me. As much as I wish that Teheran would go to a long-relief role, it’ll be either Soroka or Touki getting knocked out upon Folty’s return. If you can manage it, pick up both and play the waiting game.

Erik Swanson, SP, Seattle Mariners

Seattle may have stolen a mid-rotation starter from the Yankees. Acquired in the deal sending James Paxton to New York, Swanson has already made his mark on the big leagues. He was already called up and sent down earlier this season, but an injury to Wade LeBlanc gave him another chance. He proceeded to shut down the Indians in six innings to the tune of one run, five strikeouts, and no walks. LeBlanc’s strained oblique should keep him out at least a month, which gives Swanson a solid opportunity.

Therefore, you should consider picking up for the back-end of your fantasy rotation. He was fantastic across three levels for the Yankees last year with high K/BB ratios and an enviable three-pitch mix. His one downfall may be the long-ball as his flyball rate was high in the minors. However, with his home park and terrific outfield defense, his HR/FB rate should be suppressed for the most part. The reverse side of this is that it was Cleveland he performed well against – not exactly a lineup of world-beaters there. IT won’t cost you much to find out if his performance was a fluke or not, though.

Kyle Wright, SP, Atlanta Braves

In a corresponding move for Touki’s call-up, the Braves had to send someone down and that turned out to be Wright along with Bryse Wilson. After a few up-and-down starts in his big league debut, the Braves thought it best to send him down to regain some confidence. After all, he hadn’t pitched much at Triple-A Gwinnett last year and this was a tall task for him coming out of spring.

When I watched him pitch, it was simply a lack of control, which was uncharacteristic of him relative to his minor league days. It must have been a combination of nerves and the opposing offenses he was facing. After a rough start against Philly, he dominated against the Marlins and was terrible against the Mets. You won’t find many rookie starters that wouldn’t do the same against those opponents, so I’m not too worried about his long-term prospects.

Injury Update

Julio Rodriguez HBP in his first AB on the wrist and he’s in pain and has to leave the game. In other news, I’m headed to West Virginia, please Venmo me bail money. — Lookout Landing (@LookoutLanding) April 13, 2019

Hitters

The news on Alex Kirilloff is that there is no news. Since suffering a wrist injury in Spring Training (of which I cannot find evidence of), he’s been shelved by the front office. However, upon his return, he will make his 2019 debut at Double-A Pensacola, which is quite an impressive feat given where he was at the start of 2018. His expected return is in late April, but with this news, I’m willing to push it back to May.

Standout Seattle prospect Julio Rodriguez was turning heads in the early going with a 172 wRC+ in nine games. A plunk on the wrist in his most recent at-bat has seen him sit out the last few days. X-rays came back negative, so he should be back in short order. It’s certainly something to keep an eye on, though.

Pitchers

Good news, Brent Honeywell enthusiasts! He pitched in a simulated game last week and should start ramping up the rehab with starts in the minors soon. The Rays don’t expect him to pitch in the majors until the summer. A rotation of Honeywell, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and Charlie Morton should terrify opponents, especially Boston and New York if they can’t get their acts together.

Jose Suarez is rehabbing in extended Spring Training for the Angels. This is a particularly interesting name given the state of the Angels’ starting rotation. The starting staff is currently in the bottom five of the majors in ERA, FIP, and K-BB%. Suarez had a chance to break with them out of camp until his shoulder injury, so it stands to reason that he could move up quickly.

Three Up!

Yordan Alvarez hits bombs. 3 for 3 with 3 HRs 🔥 (4/6/19) pic.twitter.com/aMsbMccsBg — Prospect Gifs (@prospectgifs) April 7, 2019

Yordan Alvarez, 1B/OF, Houston Astros

If you’ve followed my minor league articles in the past, you’ll know that I love Alvarez. He’s built like a tree, has a swing as smooth as a saxophone, and power to all fields as seen in the video above.

The 21-year-old’s also making a strong push to join the majors right now. In his first 12 games, he’s popped seven homers and has a walk rate (19.6%) that is higher than his strikeout rate (17.6%). His 0.517 wOBA and 204 wRC+ across that span are among the top five in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and you can add this league to the list of leagues that did not faze him in his development as a hitter.

The major knock on Alvarez is his defensive ability, which I didn’t get to witness since he was the designated hitter when I saw him. That should tell you enough though – he was DH’ed in a Double-A game because of his defense. However, the DH spot is open for Houston as long as Tyler White keeps underperforming. If Alvarez keeps this up, there’s no way Houston keeps him down. He would warrant an immediate pickup in redraft leagues and should already be owned and cherished in your dynasty leagues.

97 mph coming in, a whole lot more going out! CAVAN BIGGIO launched his second home run of the season in the #Bisons loss to the RailRiders today. #BlueJays @MiLB pic.twitter.com/zJSVM2Ak95 — Buffalo Bisons (@BuffaloBisons) April 7, 2019

Cavan Biggio, 2B, Toronto Blue Jays

One of the few Triple-A hitters that are performing to the level of Alvarez is Biggio. As of this writing, he’s also striking out (15.2%) less than walking (17.4%) and proving once again that his change in philosophy towards power at the plate is not a fluke. After posting a 0.247 ISO in 132 games at Double-A last year, he’s got a 0.243 ISO in his first 12 matches at Triple-A.

I would hope that the Jays would feel inclined to call him up early in the summer. He can play at second, third, or in the outfield, which gives him great versatility and more guys to beat out. Speaking of guys to beat out, have you seen this Jays roster? They have a lot of average-at-best bats filling up the lineup like Billy McKinney, Brandon Drury, and Alen Hanson. You gotta think Vlad Guerrero Jr. takes the third base job in short order, but there are still two or three spots for Biggio to claim.

For an offense in the lower quartile of most crucial categories, one has to think that Toronto prospects will get their shot. Given Biggio’s hot start, his opportunity could come sooner rather than later.

Cole Tucker, SS, Pittsburgh Pirates

Known for his lightning speed and defensive prowess, Tucker is now providing more pop in the early going. He’s popped a couple of bombs along with three doubles and a triple in his first 11 games in Triple-A.

Watching him throughout the Arizona Fall League, this comes as no surprise to me as he does look like he’s got more power in the swing. His current 0.220 ISO may not be in the cards, but I don’t think Steamer gives him enough credit at 0.101 either. If he can give us a 0.120 to 0.130 ISO with his stolen base ability and walk rate, we could have a Jonathan Villar-type of fantasy player. In rotisserie formats in dynasty leagues, that’s incredibly juicy in the middle infield! (Not to mention that he will get a juiced ball, which makes things even juicier!)

Looking down the road, it’s hard to picture anyone blocking him. He’s the top middle infield prospect in the system and the Bucs don’t have much at the major league level. Adam Frazier and Erik Gonzalez are just eating innings until Pittsburgh thinks Tucker is ready. That could be as early as July or as late as 2020. Long-term, his defense will allow him to achieve everyday at-bats and allow him to build his offensive game.

Three Down!

Kyle Tucker, OF, Houston Astros

This Tucker is headed in the opposite direction as the previous one. Any time you are putting up negative wRC+ numbers, there is cause for concern. It’s wise to chalk this up as just a typical slump for a consensus top-ten prospect, but those who took a flier on him in redraft leagues have to be bummed. They also have to be wondering if he is now droppable in their 15-teamer.

With Alvarez performing like he is, it’s tough to envision Tucker getting a call-up anytime soon. If he were hitting well, he would be an easy promotion to take the place of the Jake Marisnick–Josh Reddick platoon. Alas, his cold start is costing him major league at-bats and Alvarez has likely leap-frogged him in the pecking order of Triple-A guys to be called up. Tucker is still preferred in the dynasty realm, but I think I would take Alvarez over Tucker for 2019 major-league statistics.

I could also be incredibly biased towards Alvarez having seen him in person. Internal conflict resides in my frontal lobe. On to the next guy…

Bo Bichette, SS, Toronto Blue Jays

Similarly to the Tucker-Alvarez situation in Houston is the Bichette-Biggio situation in Toronto. As Bichette struggles at Triple-A, it appears that Biggio would be first in line to take a middle infield spot should it come up in the summer. The good news here is that he’s starting to heat up at the plate. He’s currently on an eight-game hitting streak, but six of those games just saw one hit. Nonetheless, it’s a good sign for Bichette moving forward.

Which brings me to my next point, there’s no cause for concern here at all. Bichette is a top-ten fantasy prospect and one week of statistics can’t change that. Dynasty owners will be rewarded for their patience with Bichette once he is called up this year.

Isan Diaz, 2B, Miami Marlins

Now, here’s a player that I am truly concerned about. Once believed to be a three-true-outcome hitter, he’s starting to change his philosophy for the worse. Whether it’s intentional or not, he’s pulling the ball less and putting the ball on the ground more in Triple-A. Now, back in the day, everyone would be all for this change. However, it’s 2019 and the Gallo/Moncada ways of life are welcomed. We want the old Isan back! Walk at that 15% rate, strike out at that 30% rate, and pull some balls to the moon!

From a fantasy perspective, I’m wondering what his upside looks like now. I am of the belief that his stolen bases are a product of smart baserunning. I could see ten steals a season, but not much more. So, where does that leave him? Well, he could likely put up decent OBP with a subpar average. Additionally, if he can return to his roots, you see the homer potential in the mid-20’s. It could look very similar to Moncada’s 2018 line, which is still useful in fantasy circles. However, if this new philosophy change sticks around, you could be getting empty OBP, which just sounds terrible. He is a player whose plate approach I will be monitoring in the early going.

Live Look-In

I’ve got nothing here for you this week. Again. It might be a third straight week in Week 4. Or does this author have a trick up his sleeve? Stay tuned!

Bill Binney States that the NSA Has 32 Pages of Communications Between Seth Rich and Julian Assange, As Revealed by a FOIA Request

Mark F. McCarty Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 19

About six months ago, a blogpost by “Publius Tacitus” appeared regarding attorney Ty Clevenger’s FOIA request regarding Seth Rich:

“But now there is new information that may corroborate what the human sources quoted in the Fox article claimed about Seth’s role in getting the DNC documents to Wikileaks. Borne from a FOIA request filed in November 2017 by attorney Ty Clevenger, who requested any information regarding Seth Rich and Julian Assange. The NSA informed Clevenger in a letter dated 4 October 2018 that:

Your request has been processed under the provisions of the FOIA. Fifteen documents (32 pages) responsive to your request have been reviewed by this Agency as required by the FOIA and have found to be currently and properly classified in accordance with Executive Order 13526. These documents meet the criteria for classification as set forth in Subparagraph © of Section 1.4 and remains classified TOP SECRET and SECRET.

If NSA had come back and said, “No, we do not have anything pertaining to Seth Rich,” that would have been news. It would have been especially unwelcome news for those who believe that Seth was the source on the DNC emails. But now the opposite is true. The NSA says that it has documents that are classified TS and S. What do those documents say or prove? That remains to be seen.”

At the time this appeared, I felt that it was of high significance, but I wasn’t quite sure what it meant. What is meant by “any information regarding Julian Assange and Seth Rich?” Reports generated within the NSA that mention both? Communications in which either mentions the other? Direct communications between the two? What was the actual language of Clevenger’s request?

The final sentence of the blogpost seems to muddy the waters even more:

Eighth, the NSA has confirmed that it has Top Secret and Secret documents responsive to a FOIA request for information concerning contact between Seth Rich and other people including Julian Assange.

“And other people”?

Although I was somewhat confused by the meaning of this revelation, I commented on its significance. At the very least, it meant that the view that Seth was the source of the Wikileaks DNC releases was more than the brainless and callous conspiracy theory that mainstream media were making it out to be.

Fortunately, Bill Binney, one of the founding fathers of the NSA, and universally acknowledged to be one of the most brilliant people who ever worked for the U.S. government, has offered clarification on this issue in a brief interview with Ed Butowsky he gave two days ago.

In this interview, he offers a devastating rebuke of the fraudulence of the Mueller report’s analysis of “Russian hacking”. But the truly fascinating part occurs at about 6:40, where Binney discusses Clevenger’s FOIA request.

Here’s what Binney says:

“Ty Clevenger has FOIAed information from NSA asking for any data that involved both Seth Rich and also Julian Assange.

And they responded by saying we’ve got 15 files, 32 pages, but they’re all classified in accordance with executive order 13526 covering classification, and therefore you can’t have them.

That says that NSA has records of communications between Seth Rich and Julian Assange. I mean, that’s the only business that NSA is in — copying communications between people and devices.”

If Binney is interpreting this correctly — and bear in mind that, not only is he extraordinarily bright, but he is sometimes referred to as “the father of the NSA” — this provides strong support for the hypothesis that Seth was indeed Wikileaks’ source for the DNC emails it published. Assange has strongly hinted at this, Sy Hersh claims to have a trusted informant inside the FBI who states that he has seen FBI documents verifying this, and Binney himself says that he has two sources inside the intel community vouching for this.

(Go to the 8:30 mark — Binney inadvertently refers to “Seth” when he means “Sy”.)

Consistent with the possibility that Seth (or some other DNC employee) leaked the documents, Binney and colleagues have recently demonstrated that the DNC documents passed through a thumbdrive prior to their publication. There would have been no obvious need for such a transfer if Russians had hacked them remotely.

Beyond that, as Binney makes clear, the Mueller report’s tale of how Wikileaks received the DNC emails from GRU agents styling themselves as “Guccifer 2.0” is absurd on its face to reasonable people who will examine the pertinent evidence.

Astute cyberanalysts such as Adam Carter, the Forensicator, and Binney himself have presented compelling evidence that, far from being a Russian hacker masquerading as Romanian, G2.0 has operated in US time zones, down-loaded some of his “hacks” via thumbdrive, purposely implanted “Russian fingerprints” in the meta-data of some of his releases, made amateur attempts to impersonate a Russian using intermittently broken English, and never himself published any documents denigratory to the Clinton campaign. The GRU, if indeed they had hacked the DNC, would have had no need for such a ridiculous figure — but G2.0 functions wonderfully as a vehicle for incriminating Russia as the source of the DNC emails published by Wikileaks, tarring Russia and Assange with the same brush. G2.0’s contact with Wikileaks shortly (too shortly!) before the Wikileaks DNC release was evidently an attempt to produce a false trail that investigators (i.e. Mueller) could point to as G2.0's hand-off of the DNC emails to Wikleaks.

And if you examine Mueller’s report carefully, you’ll note that he never actually states or demonstrates that the material which G2.0 passed along to Wikileaks consisted of the DNC emails which Wikileaks published, undoubtedly because Mueller has no evidence for this. Indeed, the Forensicator has now shown that DNC emails with attachments which Wikileaks published would require the transfer of a file far larger that the “1 Gb or so” transfer described in Mueller’s report.

The cyberanalytic findings pointing to G2.0 being a fraud masquerading as a Russian hacker are touched on in Binney’s video, and comprehensively discussed in the website of Adam Carter devoted to this issue:

How does Mueller’s report deal with this countervailing evidence? Does he offer credible rebuttals to each of the findings? No, with consummate dishonesty he simply ignores this evidence in toto. And he feels no compunction to address this evidence because, with rare exception the stenographic MSM have done so as well, so that most Americans are wholly unaware of it. Mueller’s report on “Russian meddling” is simply intended to reinforce the Deep State’s preferred narrative, which he achieves by cherry-picking the evidence that he deigns to consider. This was the precise strategy that our Deep State — including Mueller himself — employed when they sold our nation on Saddam’s vast stocks of WMDs.

And here’s another intriguing point. Crowdstrike’s co-founder Shawn Henry used to be Mueller’s deputy at the FBI, acting as head of the counterintelligence division. Adam Carter informs me that, while Henry headed that division, it made an attempt to destroy Wikileaks’ reputation by feeding it documents that had been purposely altered; fortunately, Wikileaks exercised its customary caution and refused to take the bait. G2.0 — very likely a creation of Crowdstrike — appears to have been another attempt to smear Wikileaks, one that has worked wonderfully well with much of the American public. Clinton’s incompetence was expiated, Wikileaks was smeared, and the Russia was further defamed, all in one stroke — the Deep State’s wet dream! Assange became, not a journalist working with an American whistleblower disgusted by the gross bias of the DNC against Bernie, but instead a tool of malign Russians intent on meddling in our democracy and saddling us with the ridiculous Trump.

And, as to Seth Rich’s mysterious death, ask yourself this: who would have been in a perfect position to destroy the “Russian hacking” narrative that Clinton’s campaign and Crowdstrike had decided to run with?

So let’s push to get the real story out. And, if it turns out that Seth was indeed the source of the DNC emails published by Wikileaks, we’ll need to apologize to Russia, and then decide whom to send to prison for the rest of their miserable prevaricating lives.

Update: Reader Leonardo Facchin has found the entire letter from NSA responding to Ty Clevenger’s FOIA request, which he has posted below. This indicates that Clevenger had asked for more than just communications between Seth and Assange, and that Binney might therefore be incorrect in concluding that all 32 pages consist of such communications. However, the fact that NSA has 32 pages of secret/top secret documents on Seth remains highly significant — and the other findings cited here pointing to Seth as the likely leaker, and discrediting Mueller’s claim that G2.0 is a Russian hacker who was Assange’s source, remain valid.
Smith-Pelly, 26, has recorded eight points (4g, 4a) in 54 games with the Capitals this season. In 20 games with Hershey, the 6'0", 223-pound forwarded recorded 14 points (6g, 8a), including a hat trick on March 10 against the Hartford Wolf Pack.

The Washington Capitals have recalled forward Devante Smith-Pelly from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) and re-assigned goaltender Vitek Vanecek to Hershey, senior vice president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

Smith-Pelly collected 16 points (7g, 9a) in a career-high 75 games with the Capitals last season. During the Capitals' 2018 Stanley Cup run, Smith-Pelly was tied for fourth on the Capitals in goals (7) and scored in three-straight games in the Stanley Cup Final against Vegas. Additionally, Smith-Pelly scored the series-clinching goal in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal against Columbus. In 48 career playoff games, Smith-Pelly has 13 goals, and his 0.27 goals per game rating is tied for the 47th-highest in the NHL among active players with at least 45 career playoff games. Since joining Washington in 2017-18, the Scarborough, Ont., native has 24 points (11g, 13a) in 129 regular season games.

Smith-Pelly has recorded 101 points (44g, 57a) in 395 career NHL games with Anaheim, Montreal, New Jersey and Washington.

Smith-Pelly was drafted by Anaheim in the second round, 42nd overall, in the 2010 NHL Draft.

Vanecek, 23, has posted a record of 21-10-6 with a 2.62 goals against average and a .907 save percentage in 38 games with the Bears this season. The 6'1", 190-pound goaltender was named to the 2019 AHL All-Star Classic Atlantic Division team and was named the CCM/AHL Player of the Week for the period ending Oct. 21. In that span, Vanecek posted a 2-0-1 record with a 1.62 goals against average and a .949 save percentage, stopping 94 of 99 shots in three road starts. The Havlickuv Brod, Czech Republic, native has allowed two or fewer goals in 19 games this season.

In 110 career games with the Bears, Vanecek has a 52-33-24 record with a 2.69 goals against average, a .903 save percentage and nine shutouts.

The Capitals selected Vanecek with their second round pick, 39th overall, in the 2014 NHL Draft.
CLC Group Connects Steam With Smart Contracts

Timo Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 19

Some of the more popular developments in late 2017 focused on scarcity and non-fungibility on the Ethereum blockchain, with ‘tokenization’ being one of the key buzzwords. One of the leading blockchain-based ‘games’, CryptoKitties, managed to clog up the entire Ethereum network for days on end.

CryptoKitties proved that blockchain-based digital collectibles will be one of the most significant use cases in the space. But why is it that digital, in-game items — such as skins, loot crates, and other collectables — hold real-world value, and what is their future in a tokenized world?

How are they Relevant?

While it has tremendous utility as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, some of Bitcoin’s valuation can be traced to simple scarcity — much like how scarcity leads party hats in RuneScape or rare skins in CS:GO to serve as both in-game and real world currencies with prices over 10,000$. But with Bitcoin, it’s the security of the underlying blockchain protocol and the social consensus around it which makes this scarcity guaranteed. Similarly, having an asset digitally held on a network like Ethereum provides the trustless guarantee that an item that you own is yours alone. Currently, in-game items rarely have these guarantees.

We saw CryptoKitties taking off because of the popularity of card collectibles combined with scarcity (which was limited here by a sufficable issuance rate). CryptoKitties was just the first live example of this happening to a non-ERC-20 token, one which had the additional qualities of being usable in a sort of “game” environment where players could interact with their cats.

The Current State of This Industry

Across the industry, virtual goods are getting increasingly popular and giving game studios a new means to extract value. The highly popular title ‘Fortnite’ has, for example, recently set a new record in revenue by netting nearly 2.5 billion dollars in a single year. While the game itself is entirely free-2-play, its revenue was sourced from players spending money on in-game items like skins, collectibles and cosmetics. Many competitive free-2-play games also follow this model. By and large these items do not provide spendthrift players any inherent advantage for their games, and they are only for cosmetic purposes.

In 2017, the size of this market reached around 50 billion dollars according to WAX, a leading digital items trading platform. There are serious investors and traders in these marketplaces actively making a living on these digital assets.

The one problem in the industry is that these items are game-bound. Once a game dies, a player’s items die with it. This is a fundamental market flaw that blockchain can tackle — specifically, through smart contracts.

Opening This Market Up to the Blockchain

Opening up the market and bringing these collectibles to the blockchain would make them game-agnostic, thus significantly raising their value. A user can achieve true ownership, as no central developer company can interfere with the market to ‘reprint’ these items. This was actually one of the main reasons why Vitalik Buterin started Ethereum: a single company changed the value of an item that his in-game character possessed, thus changing its strength, which he’d put years of work into.

At CLC Group, we believe this market will only continue to expand, which is why we’ve worked to connect it with the smart contract ecosystem through the Chainlink decentralized oracle network.

In that regard, we are excited to share with you our latest partner, SteamAPIs.com, which will be listed on our Honeycomb marketplace at launch.

SteamAPIs is the leading API provider for accessing the Steam Community Market, which features over 360,000 digital items, skins, and collectibles, and which has transacted over 3.2 billion dollars during its lifetime. On the Community Market roughly 30,000 items are updated daily, and there are over 3 million individual users investing, trading, and gambling with these digital assets.

Together with SteamAPIs, CLC Group is the first to open up this global, digital market to smart contract developers, making it possible to trade, invest and tokenize these assets through smart contracts.

The Future of the Industry

Take a random CS:GO gambling website for example. Right now, there are dozens of markets with millions of dollars in volume where users gamble to win specific items in a lottery format. There exists a risk in skins being stolen or lost with websites shutting down, and users never know how the lottery algorithms are set up since it’s closed code.

With Chainlink and CLC Group, you can now connect a smart contract to a random number generator, offered by Chainlink, and the SteamAPI. The smart contract could then select a winner within a pool of participants, and by true randomness directly change the ownership of a Steam Marketplace item. Right now the centralized gambling websites handle these transfers, and they pose a risk to users through shutdowns and lottery tampering. These shutdowns happen regularly. In fact, the community even manages a list of known scam websites on github. The promise of smart contracts on Ethereum cutting out the middlemen is perfect fit and immediately applicable.

This is actually a use case which Cornell professor Ari Juels described in the Town Crier whitepaper. The whitepaper specifically cites a use case with Steam, and explains how a Town Crier authenticated data feed could be used as a trustless oracle for an exchange to take place within a secure enclave, whereby user credentials can be securely added to such an enclave in order to enable an exchange of games or items. Ari elaborates on how Town Crier would work with Chainlink here.

When the Town Crier whitepaper was published, the Steam API was not open to the public. We have now included an adapter for Steam APIs as part of our offering on Honeycomb, bundled together with a per-call pricing, which allows smart contracts to connect with these APIs through Chainlink.

In its current state, a smart contract would be able to use the API to query a list of a users items, the items price, the amount of the item model existing on the market, the lowest price it was sold and the highest price it was bought. The Chainlink node can get proof of the transaction happening with checking the buyers profile list of skins and see if the item ID is in that. In case the transfer didn’t happen, an pre-decided collateral (in cryptocurrency) would go back to the buyer.

At CLC Group, we’re proud to take the first steps to enable the tokenization of all in-game items and collectables. This tokenization will grant owners additional securities and enable new markets, which will in turn unlock the full potential of tokenized game assets. We’re thrilled to be a part of this burgeoning industry, and look forward to watching it grow in the coming years.

CLC Group is presenting an opportunity to own a share in the company to the general public. Check out our website for more info about the STO.

Warehouse robotics on the rise

Study shows an 18 percent increase in testing of warehouse robotics in 2019.

By DC Velocity Staff

Robotics are on the rise in the warehouse, according to a new study from supply chain and business intelligence firm eyefortransport (eft), released this month.

With the trend toward warehouse automation well underway, eft asked supply chain executives at retail and manufacturing organizations about their use of robotics as part of its Global Customer Report 2019. The results revealed an 18 percent year-over-year increase in the testing of warehouse robotics, with 25 percent of the 100 companies surveyed saying they are testing robotics in a limited number of warehouses this year.

The study also showed that while the barriers to implementing warehouse robotics have not changed, most organizations say they are easing. Customers still struggle with the cost, justifying return-on-investment (ROI) calculations, and understanding where or how to start implementing robotic warehouse solutions, but to a lesser degree over the past year. As concerns, eft said ROI calculations decreased by 15 percent and understanding where or how to start decreased by 18 percent. Cost was down by 10 percent, the study authors said. They also cited improvement in finding the right robotics supplier: In 2018, 11 percent of organizations said that finding the right supplier was a barrier to implementing warehouse robotics, compared to just 2 percent in 2019.

"With the barriers decreasing dramatically this past year, the field remains optimistic that warehouse robotics will be the future for accurate, timely and organized operations that allow a better experience for customers," the survey authors said.

Eyefortransport surveyed 100 supply chain executives from retail and manufacturing organizations across North America and Europe for its Global Customer Report 2019.

It was an extremely busy week for this author. The Masters was a masterful four-day event that saw the Tiger comeback win him his money back in the FanDuel MEGA Eagle tournament (thank you, Jesus). The NBA and NHL playoffs are in full swing and have seen some crazy underdogs win road games and series. And, I watched my first episode of Game of Thrones.

Yep – the first one I’ve ever watched is Season 8, Episode 1. You should’ve seen the look on my coworkers’ faces when I asked them what the ‘weird blue eyes’ meant. I’ve also decided to suspend my Season 8 viewing and go back to the beginning now. Have I already encountered too many spoilers? Hopefully not.

To cap off the week, I was able to dig into some minor league data and map out some Double-A and collegiate games to attend to do some fantasy scouting. How fun is that? I’m looking to keep this sportstacular month of April going with some live looks that I can share in this weekly prospect report.

But enough about my antics – let’s catch up on some minor league action through the first two weeks!

Touki Toussaint, SP, Atlanta Braves

It’s finally Touki time! As a Braves fan, we are on a first-name basis. No, this has nothing to do with my brain always wanting to put the ‘i’ in his last name after the ‘u’. Does that happen to anyone else?

Anyway, Touki was able to force his way back into the rotation after a masterful performance in relief of Sean Newcomb. The latter could not get out of the third inning and the former took it from there. In fact, the Braves went as far as to send Newcomb down to work on his control issues. Shocker. Now, Touki gets a chance this weekend to prove his worth with a start against the Indians. By the way, that makes him a viable starting option off of the waiver wire.

As with all Atlanta arms other than Mike Foltynewicz (upon return), there’s always the possibility of getting demoted or relegated to the bullpen. With Max Fried pitching well and Julio Teheran and Kevin Gausman getting the veteran treatment, that fifth spot is turning into a game of musical chairs. This week, Touki found the lucky seat, but who will it be next? Newcomb, Bryse Wilson, and Kyle Wright (mentioned later) will require a few starts at Triple-A. However, it’s Mike Soroka, who also joins the rotation this week, that worries me. As much as I wish that Teheran would go to a long-relief role, it’ll be either Soroka or Touki getting knocked out upon Folty’s return. If you can manage it, pick up both and play the waiting game.

Erik Swanson, SP, Seattle Mariners

Seattle may have stolen a mid-rotation starter from the Yankees. Acquired in the deal sending James Paxton to New York, Swanson has already made his mark on the big leagues. He was already called up and sent down earlier this season, but an injury to Wade LeBlanc gave him another chance. He proceeded to shut down the Indians in six innings to the tune of one run, five strikeouts, and no walks. LeBlanc’s strained oblique should keep him out at least a month, which gives Swanson a solid opportunity.

Therefore, you should consider picking up for the back-end of your fantasy rotation. He was fantastic across three levels for the Yankees last year with high K/BB ratios and an enviable three-pitch mix. His one downfall may be the long-ball as his flyball rate was high in the minors. However, with his home park and terrific outfield defense, his HR/FB rate should be suppressed for the most part. The reverse side of this is that it was Cleveland he performed well against – not exactly a lineup of world-beaters there. IT won’t cost you much to find out if his performance was a fluke or not, though.

Kyle Wright, SP, Atlanta Braves

In a corresponding move for Touki’s call-up, the Braves had to send someone down and that turned out to be Wright along with Bryse Wilson. After a few up-and-down starts in his big league debut, the Braves thought it best to send him down to regain some confidence. After all, he hadn’t pitched much at Triple-A Gwinnett last year and this was a tall task for him coming out of spring.

When I watched him pitch, it was simply a lack of control, which was uncharacteristic of him relative to his minor league days. It must have been a combination of nerves and the opposing offenses he was facing. After a rough start against Philly, he dominated against the Marlins and was terrible against the Mets. You won’t find many rookie starters that wouldn’t do the same against those opponents, so I’m not too worried about his long-term prospects.

Injury Update

Julio Rodriguez HBP in his first AB on the wrist and he’s in pain and has to leave the game. In other news, I’m headed to West Virginia, please Venmo me bail money. — Lookout Landing (@LookoutLanding) April 13, 2019

Hitters

The news on Alex Kirilloff is that there is no news. Since suffering a wrist injury in Spring Training (of which I cannot find evidence of), he’s been shelved by the front office. However, upon his return, he will make his 2019 debut at Double-A Pensacola, which is quite an impressive feat given where he was at the start of 2018. His expected return is in late April, but with this news, I’m willing to push it back to May.

Standout Seattle prospect Julio Rodriguez was turning heads in the early going with a 172 wRC+ in nine games. A plunk on the wrist in his most recent at-bat has seen him sit out the last few days. X-rays came back negative, so he should be back in short order. It’s certainly something to keep an eye on, though.

Pitchers

Good news, Brent Honeywell enthusiasts! He pitched in a simulated game last week and should start ramping up the rehab with starts in the minors soon. The Rays don’t expect him to pitch in the majors until the summer. A rotation of Honeywell, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and Charlie Morton should terrify opponents, especially Boston and New York if they can’t get their acts together.

A rotation of Honeywell, Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and Charlie Morton should terrify opponents, especially Boston and New York if they can’t get their acts together. Jose Suarez is rehabbing in extended Spring Training for the Angels. This is a particularly interesting name given the state of the Angels’ starting rotation. The starting staff is currently in the bottom five of the majors in ERA, FIP, and K-BB%. Suarez had a chance to break with them out of camp until his shoulder injury, so it stands to reason that he could move up quickly.

In the latest edition of ‘I have no idea where to find minor league injury news’, we come to Michel Baez. He was placed on the injured list with shoulder inflammation on April 1st and we haven’t heard anything since. Sigh.

Three Up!

Yordan Alvarez hits bombs. 3 for 3 with 3 HRs 🔥 (4/6/19) pic.twitter.com/aMsbMccsBg — Prospect Gifs (@prospectgifs) April 7, 2019

Yordan Alvarez, 1B/OF, Houston Astros

If you’ve followed my minor league articles in the past, you’ll know that I love Alvarez. He’s built like a tree, has a swing as smooth as a saxophone, and power to all fields as seen in the video above.

The 21-year-old’s also making a strong push to join the majors right now. In his first 12 games, he’s popped seven homers and has a walk rate (19.6%) that is higher than his strikeout rate (17.6%). His 0.517 wOBA and 204 wRC+ across that span are among the top five in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and you can add this league to the list of leagues that did not faze him in his development as a hitter.

The major knock on Alvarez is his defensive ability, which I didn’t get to witness since he was the designated hitter when I saw him. That should tell you enough though – he was DH’ed in a Double-A game because of his defense. However, the DH spot is open for Houston as long as Tyler White keeps underperforming. If Alvarez keeps this up, there’s no way Houston keeps him down. He would warrant an immediate pickup in redraft leagues and should already be owned and cherished in your dynasty leagues.

97 mph coming in, a whole lot more going out! CAVAN BIGGIO launched his second home run of the season in the #Bisons loss to the RailRiders today. #BlueJays @MiLB pic.twitter.com/zJSVM2Ak95 — Buffalo Bisons (@BuffaloBisons) April 7, 2019

Cavan Biggio, 2B, Toronto Blue Jays

One of the few Triple-A hitters that are performing to the level of Alvarez is Biggio. As of this writing, he’s also striking out (15.2%) less than walking (17.4%) and proving once again that his change in philosophy towards power at the plate is not a fluke. After posting a 0.247 ISO in 132 games at Double-A last year, he’s got a 0.243 ISO in his first 12 matches at Triple-A.

I would hope that the Jays would feel inclined to call him up early in the summer. He can play at second, third, or in the outfield, which gives him great versatility and more guys to beat out. Speaking of guys to beat out, have you seen this Jays roster? They have a lot of average-at-best bats filling up the lineup like Billy McKinney, Brandon Drury, and Alen Hanson. You gotta think Vlad Guerrero Jr. takes the third base job in short order, but there are still two or three spots for Biggio to claim.

For an offense in the lower quartile of most crucial categories, one has to think that Toronto prospects will get their shot. Given Biggio’s hot start, his opportunity could come sooner rather than later.

Cole Tucker, SS, Pittsburgh Pirates

Known for his lightning speed and defensive prowess, Tucker is now providing more pop in the early going. He’s popped a couple of bombs along with three doubles and a triple in his first 11 games in Triple-A.

Watching him throughout the Arizona Fall League, this comes as no surprise to me as he does look like he’s got more power in the swing. His current 0.220 ISO may not be in the cards, but I don’t think Steamer gives him enough credit at 0.101 either. If he can give us a 0.120 to 0.130 ISO with his stolen base ability and walk rate, we could have a Jonathan Villar-type of fantasy player. In rotisserie formats in dynasty leagues, that’s incredibly juicy in the middle infield! (Not to mention that he will get a juiced ball, which makes things even juicier!)

Looking down the road, it’s hard to picture anyone blocking him. He’s the top middle infield prospect in the system and the Bucs don’t have much at the major league level. Adam Frazier and Erik Gonzalez are just eating innings until Pittsburgh thinks Tucker is ready. That could be as early as July or as late as 2020. Long-term, his defense will allow him to achieve everyday at-bats and allow him to build his offensive game.

Three Down!

Kyle Tucker, OF, Houston Astros

This Tucker is headed in the opposite direction as the previous one. Any time you are putting up negative wRC+ numbers, there is cause for concern. It’s wise to chalk this up as just a typical slump for a consensus top-ten prospect, but those who took a flier on him in redraft leagues have to be bummed. They also have to be wondering if he is now droppable in their 15-teamer.

With Alvarez performing like he is, it’s tough to envision Tucker getting a call-up anytime soon. If he were hitting well, he would be an easy promotion to take the place of the Jake Marisnick–Josh Reddick platoon. Alas, his cold start is costing him major league at-bats and Alvarez has likely leap-frogged him in the pecking order of Triple-A guys to be called up. Tucker is still preferred in the dynasty realm, but I think I would take Alvarez over Tucker for 2019 major-league statistics.

I could also be incredibly biased towards Alvarez having seen him in person. Internal conflict resides in my frontal lobe. On to the next guy…

Bo Bichette, SS, Toronto Blue Jays

Similarly to the Tucker-Alvarez situation in Houston is the Bichette-Biggio situation in Toronto. As Bichette struggles at Triple-A, it appears that Biggio would be first in line to take a middle infield spot should it come up in the summer. The good news here is that he’s starting to heat up at the plate. He’s currently on an eight-game hitting streak, but six of those games just saw one hit. Nonetheless, it’s a good sign for Bichette moving forward.

Which brings me to my next point, there’s no cause for concern here at all. Bichette is a top-ten fantasy prospect and one week of statistics can’t change that. Dynasty owners will be rewarded for their patience with Bichette once he is called up this year.

Isan Diaz, 2B, Miami Marlins

Now, here’s a player that I am truly concerned about. Once believed to be a three-true-outcome hitter, he’s starting to change his philosophy for the worse. Whether it’s intentional or not, he’s pulling the ball less and putting the ball on the ground more in Triple-A. Now, back in the day, everyone would be all for this change. However, it’s 2019 and the Gallo/Moncada ways of life are welcomed. We want the old Isan back! Walk at that 15% rate, strike out at that 30% rate, and pull some balls to the moon!

From a fantasy perspective, I’m wondering what his upside looks like now. I am of the belief that his stolen bases are a product of smart baserunning. I could see ten steals a season, but not much more. So, where does that leave him? Well, he could likely put up decent OBP with a subpar average. Additionally, if he can return to his roots, you see the homer potential in the mid-20’s. It could look very similar to Moncada’s 2018 line, which is still useful in fantasy circles. However, if this new philosophy change sticks around, you could be getting empty OBP, which just sounds terrible. He is a player whose plate approach I will be monitoring in the early going.

Don’t mess with Khal Drogo.

Just when you thought you were done being shocked by Jason Momoa for the day — he shaved off his beard for the first time seven years, in case you missed it — HBO has revealed a truly wild tale about the actor.

On Thursday, the network released a new series of animated shorts called Backstories, in which the creators of some of their hit shows share behind-the-scenes secrets. For the Game of Thronesshort, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss teamed up to tell the story of when Momoa, 39, accidentally sent one of them to the hospital.

As the story goes, the cast and crew were shooting season 2 in Belfast. Momoa, whose character died in season 1, returned to shoot a dream-like scene in which he reunites with his wife Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). After they were done, they all went out drinking to celebrate being back together.

“Jason was one of our favorite people ever on the show, and very strong,” said Benioff, 48. “And that’s not TV makeup — in real life, he’s just a big, strong dude.”

“So I’m looking at Momoa and Momoa’s talking about beating someone at the slap game,” he continued. “I was like, ‘I’ll take you at the slap game.’ I was like, I’m going to challenge the Khal, because if I beat the Khal, I am the Khal.”

Having consumed an “anesthetic quantity” of beers, the two started playing the game, which essentially consists of slapping the other person’s hands as many times as you can until you miss, then switching.

“I got a few pretty good slaps and then I missed,” Benioff began. “Then it was my turn. I put my hands out and he starts slapping.”

The rest of the group only started paying attention when they noticed a “kind of firecracker sound” going off.

“I looked over and his hands were bright red,” Weiss, 47, said of Benioff. “He was still going, and that was when all of us decided to put our conversation on hold to watch this contest.”

“I looked in Momoa’s eyes, I saw no mercy there,” Benioff recalled. “But I wouldn’t quit, because, you know, I had my pride. I had my dumb pride.”

Clarke was the one to first point out the state of Benioff’s hands.

“When we looked down to his hands, his hands didn’t look right,” Weiss admitted. “His hands were a lot bigger than his hands normally are.”

But Benioff figured the swelling would go down on its own.

“I just thought it was one of those things where it looks pretty bad — yes, they look like catcher’s mitts with bubonic plague on them, but it’s going to be better tomorrow,” he said.

When Benioff woke up the next morning, his hands had “doubled in size overnight.” He flew back to Los Angeles, where he was greeted by wife Amanda Peet.

“I was kind of trying to hide my hands a little bit,” he admitted. “But it didn’t work because they were so monstrous.”

When she saw his hands, Peet immediately drove her husband to the emergency room, where a doctor ran a few X-rays.

“Her diagnosis was that Jason Momoa had squished my hands,” Benioff revealed. “So, it just goes to show, don’t challenge the Khal.”

Game of Thrones airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on HBO.
Shortly before Attorney General William Barr held a press conference to introduce the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, left-wing media pundits and politicians decried the conference happening before the report was released.

In her rush to capitalize on the moment, 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Barr was acting as if he were President Donald Trump’s “personal attorney.”

“It's a disgrace to see an Attorney General acting as if he's the personal attorney and publicist for the President of the United States,” Warren tweeted.

Warren’s comment would carry more weight if she had also found it a “disgrace” that former Attorney General Eric Holder called himself then-President Barack Obama’s “wingman.”

"I’m still enjoying what I’m doing, there’s still work to be done. I’m still the President’s wing-man, so I’m there with my boy. So, we’ll see," Holder said on the Tom Joyner radio show in response to a question about him leaving the administration.

That interview took place in April 2013. Warren was elected in 2012 and assumed office in January 2013. A quick Twitter search finds no comment from Warren the day of or day after regarding the Politico article containing Holder’s comment.

In fact, a search of her Twitter account reveals she only tweeted twice about the former attorney general — both tweets contained praise.

Was Holder’s “wingman” statement not evidence of him “acting as if he’s the personal attorney and publicist for the President of the United States,” as Warren said of Barr?

The difference, obviously, is the party of the president.

They hypocrisy was noticed by Twitter user “Craige Schmuckatelli,” who asked Warren to “supply a link to your criticism of Holder saying that he was Obama’s ‘wingman.’”

Please supply a link to your criticism of Holder saying that he was Obama’s “wingman”. https://t.co/zEg3iAbxbO — Craigé Schmuckatelli (@CraigR3521) April 19, 2019

Warren isn’t the only Democrat (or politician of any party, to be fair) with this problem. Another recent example comes from Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who also on Thursday said he was “deeply troubled by reports that the [White House] is being briefed on the Mueller report AHEAD of its release.”

But in 1998, when Bill Clinton — a Democrat — was president, Nadler whined that the White House wasn’t given an investigatory report before it was released because it prevented his preferred commander-in-chief from creating a response.

“What is at issue here this morning is not his conduct but the fairness of the resolution before us, which is manifestly and grossly unfair,” Nadler said of Ken Starr’s report in 1998. “It is manifestly unfair because it denies the President the privilege we have given to every other person accused, as the gentleman from Michigan stated, the ability to see the accusation before it is released publicly so he can prepare a response.”

Thankfully we have the Internet, where no one’s hypocrisy can remain hidden. Politicians and pundits show who they really are in their responses to similar events under presidents from different parties. Obama telling then Russian President Dmitri Medvedev he would have “more flexibility” to negotiate after the 2012 election received barely a whiff from the mainstream media. Had Trump said the same thing to current Russian President Vladimir Putin, it would be impeachable evidence of collusion.
Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin stunned the hosts of Fox & Friends this morning after a particularly unhinged rant, in which Levin screamed and cursed about claims of obstruction against President Donald Trump.

Levin, who hosts a weekend show on Fox News and a separate show on Glenn Beck‘s BlazeTV, began his seething commentary over yesterday’s release of the special counsel’s report on Russia and Trump by calling out Robert Mueller for writing “a political document that he should never have written.”

“This is a political document that he should never have written, a political document that is 200 pages long the press keeps focusing on,” he said. “That’s why [Mueller] and Weissmann and others wrote it… This is an op-ed. This is a 200-page op-ed, that’s all this is.”

He then said a “prosecutor” could be “disbarred” for producing the report and said the contents are all based on he-said-she-said allegations.

“‘Well the prosecutor said,'” Levin began, mocking those defending the report. “Well, who gives a damn what the prosecutor said!”

Levin became increasingly angry after Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry stepped in to note that Levin is “quoting the White House counsel” and ask, “Doesn’t whether the president told the truth or not matter to you?”

“How do you know this is truthful, Ed?” Levin shot back. “You have no idea!”

He continued:

“That is why we have a court of law. That is why prosecutors — dammit! — are not supposed to write essays like this… [Mueller] didn’t have an obstruction case against the president of the United States or he would have brought it. I’m using plain English so even Joe Scarborough and Jake Tapper can understand this. Volume two is crap. Volume two was written for slip and fall lawyer Nadler, slip and fall lawyer Schiff. That’s why he wrote it. He knew the media would run with it.”

After several more minutes of Levin shouting about Hillary Clinton‘s connections to Russia, anti-Trump bias in the “the unfree press,” and insisting it was unnecessary for Mueller to write the report in the first place, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade finally cut him off after Ainsley Earhardt unsuccessfully tried to end the rant prematurely.

Secondo Uecoop, "un rifornimento self service oggi costa 1,611 euro al litro per la benzina e 1,503 euro al litro per il diesel, ma ovviamente si tratta di valori medi mentre sul territorio nazionale". "Ci sono prezzi superiori anche di diversi centesimi al litro a seconda che si vada in una stazione servita oppure che si faccia il pieno in autostrada con picchi di 1,741 euro al litro per la benzina e di 1,636 sul diesel".



A pesare complessivamente sulla spesa degli italiani per il pieno sono anche le tasse. "Nell'ultimo anno hanno inciso per il 63% sul prezzo al dettaglio della benzina e per il 59,5% per quello del gasolio: in pratica ogni volta che un automobilista si ferma alla stazione di servizio per un pieno da 55 litri lo Stato si mette in tasca oltre 48 euro sul diesel e più di 55 euro sulla benzina, fra accise e Iva. La spesa per i carburanti ha pesanti ripercussioni sui bilanci delle famiglie e delle imprese con l'Italia - conclude Uecoop - che è nella top ten mondiale per il carburante più costoso".
TPG, one of the largest private equity firms in the world, boasts a portfolio replete with tech giants like Uber and Airbnb. But after mulling over the opportunity to invest in Juul, it passed.

“For all its growth, it just felt wrong to us,” said James Coulter, TPG’s cofounder and CEO, during a session at the Fast Company Impact Council meeting in New York this morning.

That’s largely because the e-cigarette company, controversial for steering its early marketing toward teens and playing down health detriments, failed to pass Coulter’s various ethical tests.

Attitudes about taking social stances in business have changed for the better, Coulter said. Business and social responsibility used to be distinct, like the separation of church and state. Today, it’s increasingly important to develop your own moral compass and code. That code may differ for different business leaders, and your stakeholders may not always agree, but ultimately, “It’s good for business to stand for something,” Coulter said.

For instance, when it came to financially supporting DACA recipients across TPG’s portfolio, or following the Paris climate accords even in the face of the government’s neglect, those choices were obvious for Coulter.

One of the ethical tests that Coulter recommends is to ask yourself: “What would I be willing to go home and talk about at the dinner table with my family? How would they feel about the business decisions we’ve made?” If they’d feel uncomfortable, then the decision was likely a poor one.

Le conseil de bande d'Opitciwan en Haute-Mauricie estime que les membres de la communauté possèdent un droit « inaliénable » sur leur territoire ancestral et ne sont donc pas tenus de porter le vêtement coloré.

Un événement est d’ailleurs venu renforcer la position du conseil de bande. À l’automne 2016, un membre de la nation autochtone qui se trouvait dans une zone de chasse sans porter de dossard s’est vu imposer une amende de 300 $ par deux agents de la Sûreté du Québec qui agissaient alors à titre d’agents de la protection de la faune.

Selon l’article de loi tiré du Règlement sur les activités de chasse, toutes les personnes, autochtones ou non, en activité de chasse doivent porter en zone de chasse « un vêtement de façon à ce que soit visible, en tout temps et en tout angle, une surface continue de couleur orangée. »

« Ce sont nos territoires ancestraux et par conséquent nous n’avons pas à nous soumettre aux lois québécoises, lance en entrevue téléphonique Christian Awashish, chef du Conseil des Atikamekw d'Opitciwan. Nous vivons dans notre territoire 365 jours par an. Va-t-il falloir que nous portions le dossard orange toute l’année durant? »

Le chef estime d’ailleurs que le dossard est discriminant pour toute sa communauté. Il ne fait pas partie de ses habitudes, clame-t-il. « Nous avons nos propres techniques de camouflage qui ne sont pas compatibles avec ce vêtement. Les agents du gouvernement n’ont visiblement pas les formations nécessaires quant à nos spécificités culturelles propres à nos habitats. »

On a le droit de circuler dans notre territoire sans avoir à justifier notre présence auprès des autorités provinciales. Qu’on nous laisse tranquilles! Christian Awashish, chef du Conseil des Atikamekw d'Opitciwan

Dans un communiqué transmis cette semaine aux médias, le Conseil des Atikamekw d’Opitciwan explique que l’Autochtone qui a reçu la contravention se trouvait lors de son interpellation dans son territoire familial. Même si celui-ci tenait une arme dans sa main, il ne pratiquait pas pour autant une activité de chasse, soutient le communiqué.

« Nous ne pratiquons pas seulement la chasse sur notre territoire habité par les 33 principales familles que compose notre communauté. En plus de l’occuper et de le parcourir, nous l’utilisons pour nos activités traditionnelles ou pour préserver notre artisanat. »

Après plus de deux ans de procédures, le directeur des poursuites criminelles et pénales a abandonné vendredi dernier la poursuite envers le membre de la nation attikamek ayant omis de porter le dossard. Mais l’incident vient rappeler à la nation qu’elle n’est toujours pas souveraine sur les territoires traditionnels qu'elle revendique.

« Cela fait plus de quarante ans que nous tentons de faire reconnaître nos droits ancestraux sur notre territoire de 26 360 km2, rappelle le chef. Les négociations n'ont toujours pas abouti, mais nous les poursuivons devant les tribunaux avec l’espoir que nous soyons enfin entendus. »

Quitte à aller jusqu’en Cour suprême, prévient-il.

National Popular Vote Movement Seeks to Make Electoral College Obsolete

WASHINGTON—A proposal to guarantee that the winner of the national popular vote in future presidential elections becomes president of the United States—without going through the effort of amending the U.S. Constitution—now has 70 percent of the state-level support its backers say it needs to become a reality.

The 70-percent mark was achieved April 3 when New Mexico became the 15th jurisdiction in the nation to enact enabling legislation, committing its presidential electors to vote for the candidate who receives the greatest number of popular votes nationally.

Republican officeholders generally favor the current system, which incorporates the power-sharing arrangement between higher-population states and lower-population states that is at the heart of federalism.

The system, they reason, prevents smaller states from being dominated by larger states and ensures that whoever wins the presidency enjoys a measure of broad-based support across the country. It does, however, occasionally lead to a president being elected who didn’t win the national popular vote.

Democrats have long sought to get around the Electoral College, which prevents the United States from political domination at the hands of major population centers, which are controlled by Democrats in so-called blue states.

National Popular Vote

Instead of amending the Constitution, a very difficult thing to do, a group called National Popular Vote (NPV) wants the states to ignore their own voters and enter into an interstate compact that would hand the presidency to whoever gets the greatest number of popular votes nationally. Rather than abolishing the Electoral College, the plan would require presidential electors in the states and the District of Columbia to vote for the candidate who gets the most popular votes.

Constitutional amendments need two-thirds approval of each chamber of Congress, and then ratification by three-quarters of the states. Small states aren’t likely to go along with a proposal like NPV’s that would permanently water down their voting power in presidential elections.

The current system came out of the Constitutional Convention that met in 1787 in Philadelphia, and ousted the earlier constitution known as the Articles of Confederation.

NPV says its proposal “would guarantee the Presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.” Currently, 48 states give all their electoral votes to the candidate who prevails in the popular vote in that state. Nebraska and Maine use a different formula, awarding some of their electors by congressional district.

Getting to 270

According to a tally maintained by NPV, enabling legislation has been adopted in 14 states—including New Mexico, which enacted the model statute on April 3—plus the District of Columbia, representing a total of 189 electoral votes. Those states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Not one is a red Republican state.

The plan, NPV claims, would become effective when enacted by several more states with 81 more electoral votes, taking the total to the magic number of 270 out of 538, the absolute majority required to win the presidency in the Electoral College.

Getting to 270 won’t be easy, but it isn’t impossible. In eight states with bicameral legislatures–Arkansas, Arizona, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon—one legislative chamber has passed the NPV statute. The Nevada Assembly passed the statute on April 16. The measure now moves to the Nevada Senate.

Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a former Justice Department civil rights attorney, rejects the proposal for popular election of the president.

“It is an effort to dissolve the Union,” he told The Epoch Times. “States who sign on are behaving like secessionists in 1861 and are aiming to undo the Union.”

Ray Haynes, who heads the Institute for Research on Presidential Elections and is a senior consultant to NPV, defended the proposal, saying it was both legitimate and constitutional.

“The Constitution has only one sentence that addresses the method of populating the Electoral College,” he told The Epoch Times.

“The one sentence in the Constitution on appointing the electors says: ‘Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors …’”

He said when the issue was addressed by the Supreme Court in McPherson v. Blacker in 1892, the court ruled:

“The Constitution does not provide that the appointment of electors shall be by popular vote, nor that the electors shall be voted upon by a general ticket, nor that a majority of those who exercise the elective franchise can alone choose the electors. It recognizes that the people act through their representatives in the legislature, and leaves it to the legislature exclusively to define the method of effecting the object. The framers of the Constitution used words in their natural sense, and where they are plain and clear, resort to collateral aids is unnecessary, and cannot be indulged in to narrow or enlarge the text.”

Haynes was a Republican member of the California state Senate for eight years and the California Assembly for six years, and was the 2000 National Chair of the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Concerns that the proposal would lead to massive fraud are overblown, Haynes said.

“First, if critics are concerned about electoral fraud, the current system is much more prone to a focused fraud in a small area … It is much easier to conceal a localized fraud … fewer people are involved, and fewer fraudulent votes are needed, to completely change the outcome of an entire Presidential election.”
Ken Starr, the former independent counsel who spent four years investigating President Bill Clinton, went on Fox News Friday to defend President Donald Trump and accidentally admitted that the president had engaged in the same behavior of which Starr once accused Clinton in his 1998 report.

Asked about the allegations in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that Trump may have obstructed justice by urging then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to lie, Starr acknowledged, “That’s a fair point.”

“You shouldn’t be coaching a witness. That’s exactly what Bill Clinton did with Betty Currie long ago and so forth. And we put that in [the 1998 Starr report]. It can be part of obstruction of justice,” he said, speaking on Fox & Friends.

Starr was referring to one of the 10 possible episodes of obstruction of justice documented by Mueller in the report, one of which detailed an instance in which Trump told McGahn to get rid of the special counsel — orders that McGahn did not carry out. After these efforts became public, Mueller wrote, Trump allegedly demanded that McGahn put in writing that this never happened — even after McGahn made clear that it did.

Starr mounted a passionate defense of Trump, arguing that because McGahn didn’t actually carry out the order, Trump had come to “the brink” but had not crossed a “red line.”

Starr also argued on Friday that this single act was not enough to prove obstruction, “especially when you counter that with what we’ve been trying to emphasize, the full cooperation” by the Trump administration Attorney General William Barr talked about in a press conference Thursday, ahead of the report’s release.

However Barr’s description of the Trump White House as cooperative has been roundly criticized, given Trump’s prior refusal to be interviewed by Mueller’s team during the course of the investigation. In his report Thursday, Mueller also called Trump’s partial responses to written questions sent by Mueller’s team “inadequate” and insufficient.

Starr’s own report in 1998 included a lengthy section in which he alleged that Clinton had met with his executive secretary Betty Currie after his deposition about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and encouraged her to cover up their encounters. Clinton denied that he tried to get Currie to say anything untruthful.

Based on Starr’s report, the House of Representatives charged Clinton with obstruction of justice, citing his alleged attempts to tamper with possible testimony by Currie in one of its articles of impeachment. Clinton was later acquitted by the U.S. Senate.
A team of scientists at MIT and elsewhere has developed a neural network, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), that can read scientific papers and render a plain-English summary in a sentence or two. Credit: Chelsea Turner

The work of a science writer, including this one, includes reading journal papers filled with specialized technical terminology, and figuring out how to explain their contents in language that readers without a scientific background can understand.

Now, a team of scientists at MIT and elsewhere has developed a neural network, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), that can do much the same thing, at least to a limited extent: It can read scientific papers and render a plain-English summary in a sentence or two.

Even in this limited form, such a neural network could be useful for helping editors, writers, and scientists scan a large number of papers to get a preliminary sense of what they're about. But the approach the team developed could also find applications in a variety of other areas besides language processing, including machine translation and speech recognition.

The work is described in the journal Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, in a paper by Rumen Dangovski and Li Jing, both MIT graduate students; Marin Soljačić, a professor of physics at MIT; Preslav Nakov, a senior scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU; and Mićo Tatalović, a former Knight Science Journalism fellow at MIT and a former editor at New Scientist magazine.

From AI for physics to natural language

The work came about as a result of an unrelated project, which involved developing new artificial intelligence approaches based on neural networks, aimed at tackling certain thorny problems in physics. However, the researchers soon realized that the same approach could be used to address other difficult computational problems, including natural language processing, in ways that might outperform existing neural network systems.

"We have been doing various kinds of work in AI for a few years now," Soljačić says. "We use AI to help with our research, basically to do physics better. And as we got to be more familiar with AI, we would notice that every once in a while there is an opportunity to add to the field of AI because of something that we know from physics—a certain mathematical construct or a certain law in physics. We noticed that hey, if we use that, it could actually help with this or that particular AI algorithm."

This approach could be useful in a variety of specific kinds of tasks, he says, but not all. "We can't say this is useful for all of AI, but there are instances where we can use an insight from physics to improve on a given AI algorithm."

Neural networks in general are an attempt to mimic the way humans learn certain new things: The computer examines many different examples and "learns" what the key underlying patterns are. Such systems are widely used for pattern recognition, such as learning to identify objects depicted in photos.

But neural networks in general have difficulty correlating information from a long string of data, such as is required in interpreting a research paper. Various tricks have been used to improve this capability, including techniques known as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU), but these still fall well short of what's needed for real natural-language processing, the researchers say.

The team came up with an alternative system, which instead of being based on the multiplication of matrices, as most conventional neural networks are, is based on vectors rotating in a multidimensional space. The key concept is something they call a rotational unit of memory (RUM).

Essentially, the system represents each word in the text by a vector in multidimensional space—a line of a certain length pointing in a particular direction. Each subsequent word swings this vector in some direction, represented in a theoretical space that can ultimately have thousands of dimensions. At the end of the process, the final vector or set of vectors is translated back into its corresponding string of words.

"RUM helps neural networks to do two things very well," Nakov says. "It helps them to remember better, and it enables them to recall information more accurately."

After developing the RUM system to help with certain tough physics problems such as the behavior of light in complex engineered materials, "we realized one of the places where we thought this approach could be useful would be natural language processing," says Soljačić, recalling a conversation with Tatalović, who noted that such a tool would be useful for his work as an editor trying to decide which papers to write about. Tatalović was at the time exploring AI in science journalism as his Knight fellowship project.

"And so we tried a few natural language processing tasks on it," Soljačić says. "One that we tried was summarizing articles, and that seems to be working quite well."

The proof is in the reading

As an example, they fed the same research paper through a conventional LSTM-based neural network and through their RUM-based system. The resulting summaries were dramatically different.

The LSTM system yielded this highly repetitive and fairly technical summary: "Baylisascariasis," kills mice, has endangered the allegheny woodrat and has caused disease like blindness or severe consequences. This infection, termed "baylisascariasis," kills mice, has endangered the allegheny woodrat and has caused disease like blindness or severe consequences. This infection, termed "baylisascariasis," kills mice, has endangered the allegheny woodrat.

Based on the same paper, the RUM system produced a much more readable summary, and one that did not include the needless repetition of phrases: Urban raccoons may infect people more than previously assumed. 7 percent of surveyed individuals tested positive for raccoon roundworm antibodies. Over 90 percent of raccoons in Santa Barbara play host to this parasite.

Already, the RUM-based system has been expanded so it can "read" through entire research papers, not just the abstracts, to produce a summary of their contents. The researchers have even tried using the system on their own research paper describing these findings—the paper that this news story is attempting to summarize.

Here is the new neural network's summary: Researchers have developed a new representation process on the rotational unit of RUM, a recurrent memory that can be used to solve a broad spectrum of the neural revolution in natural language processing.

It may not be elegant prose, but it does at least hit the key points of information.

Çağlar Gülçehre, a research scientist at the British AI company Deepmind Technologies, who was not involved in this work, says this research tackles an important problem in neural networks, having to do with relating pieces of information that are widely separated in time or space. "This problem has been a very fundamental issue in AI due to the necessity to do reasoning over long time-delays in sequence-prediction tasks," he says. "Although I do not think this paper completely solves this problem, it shows promising results on the long-term dependency tasks such as question-answering, text summarization, and associative recall."

Gülçehre adds, "Since the experiments conducted and model proposed in this paper are released as open-source on Github, as a result many researchers will be interested in trying it on their own tasks. … To be more specific, potentially the approach proposed in this paper can have very high impact on the fields of natural language processing and reinforcement learning, where the long-term dependencies are very crucial."

Flashing between past and present, a fractured family confronts haunting memories of their old home and the terrifying events that drove them from it. - ahmetkozan

Explores a group of siblings who, as children, grew up in what would go on to become the most famous haunted house in the country. Now adults, and forced back together in the face of tragedy, the family must finally confront the ghosts of their past, some of which still lurk in their minds while others may actually be stalking the shadows of Hill House.
If special counsel Robert Mueller‘s investigation makes one thing clear, it’s that many of the news reports that President Donald Trump branded as “fake news“ were, in fact, very real news indeed.

While Mr Mueller’s report didn’t establish a criminal conspiracy and was “unable” to conclude that obstruction of justice occurred – contrary to hours of speculation among cable-news pundits during Mr Mueller’s long investigation – it also largely validated news accounts that Trump dismissed or disparaged.

Instead, at least in the Mueller team’s analysis, the fake news seems to have flowed not from the media but from the other direction.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

His report, released Thursday, cites multiple instances in which Trump and White House aides misled or lied to journalists or in public statements as the investigation was unfolding.

On the day of Mr Mueller’s appointment, in May 2017, for example, White House aides said Trump reacted calmly to the news.

Shape Created with Sketch. WITCH HUNT! Trump cashes in on Mueller report with merchandise range Show all 6 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. WITCH HUNT!

In fact, according to Mr Mueller’s report, Trump’s first reaction was anything but calm.

According to notes taken by an aide, Trump responded by saying: “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m f***ed ... This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters repeatedly in May 2017 that she personally had heard from “countless members of the FBI” that they were “grateful and thankful” to Trump for firing FBI director James Comey.

That never happened, Mr Mueller said. He wrote that Ms Sanders later acknowledged to investigators that her comments were “not founded on anything”.

Trump also dictated a press statement saying that he had fired Mr Comey based on the recommendations of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

But Mr Mueller found that Trump had already decided to fire James Comey before Gen Rosenstein had weighed in.

Mr Trump backed down and later publicly acknowledged he intended to fire Mr Comey regardless of Gen Rosenstein’s memo after unnamed Justice Department officials “made clear to him” that they would “resist” the bogus justification, Mr Mueller said.

Incoming White House aides also lied about press accounts they knew were accurate.

Former national security adviser Michael Flynn directed an aide, KT McFarland, to call Washington Post columnist David Ignatius during the presidential transition in January 2017 and deny Mr Ignatius’ reporting about Mr Flynn’s conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Ms McFarland “knew she was providing false information” when she called Mr Ignatius to dispute his surmise that Mr Flynn had discussed removing sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak. (Prompted by Ms McFarland’s call, The Post updated the column to note that a “Trump official” denied that Mr Flynn discussed sanctions.)

Mr Trump and his aides also knocked down an accurate New York Times story in May 2017 reporting that the president had asked Mr Comey for loyalty during a private dinner several months before his firing.

Mr Trump even lied about who invited whom to dinner:

He told NBC News anchor Lester Holt in an interview that month Mr Comey had asked for it because “he wanted to stay on”.

Mr Mueller found evidence that the president extended the invitation to Mr Comey on 27 January.

On the eve of Mr Comey’s testimony to Congress that May, Mr Trump sought to raise questions about his credibility, when – as Mr Mueller found – it was Trump’s credibility that was questionable.

At the time, Trump tweeted, “James Comey better hope there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press!”

Mr Comey’s contemporaneous accounts of his meeting with Mr Trump and corroboration from his FBI colleagues also show that another New York Times story, branded as “fake news” by the president, was true.

The Times reported that Trump had asked Mr Comey to end the investigation of Mr Flynn; Mr Mueller found “substantial evidence” that this was true, despite Mr Trump publicly saying otherwise.

Mr Trump also tried to persuade then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn to deny stories in The Washington Post and the Times in early 2018 that Trump had asked Mr McGahn to fire Mr Mueller about seven months earlier.

Mr McGahn refused repeatedly to undercut the stories because he knew they were “accurate in reporting on the President’s effort to have the Special Counsel removed”.

Mr Mueller noted that Trump “challenged” his lawyer for taking notes of their conversation.

“Why do you take notes?” he asked Mr McGahn, according to the report. “Lawyers don’t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.”

Mr McGahn said he kept notes because he is a “real lawyer” and to establish a record.

Mr Trump replied, “I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.’’

Mr Cohn, who was chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy, during Mr McCarthy’s communist-hunting hearings in the 1950s, was disbarred by a New York court in 1986 because of “dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation”.

President Moon Jae-in is looking to reduce South Korea's reliance on traditional partners Beijing and Washington

Tashkent (AFP)

South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday signed deals worth $12 billion with Uzbekistan during a week-long tour of Central Asia, as he seeks to ease reliance on China and the US.

President of commodity-rich Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev praised his country's "strategic partnership" with Seoul as the leaders signed documents following talks.

Moon credited Mirziyoyev for "leading Uzbekistan into a new era" with a series of bold reforms.

The nature of the deals were not specified during the press briefing.

Trade between Uzbekistan and South Korea in 2018 was just over $2 billion.

Uzbek leader Mirziyoyev is looking to break out from the economic straitjacket imposed by his late hardline predecessor Islam Karimov and encourage more foreign investment and trade.

Karimov ruled Uzbekistan from before independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 until his death in 2016.

Moon's office confirmed at the beginning of the week that economic affairs would dominate talks during his eight-day regional tour that began in gas-rich Turkmenistan and will finish in oil power Kazakhstan.

But Moon also gave a nod to the cultural ties shared by the two countries when he referenced Uzbekistan's 180,000-strong ethnic Korean population in an interview with Uzbek state media on Thursday.

In 1937, suspecting divided loyalties, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had the entire ethnic Korean population of the Russian Far East -- around 172,000 people -- transported to Central Asia on cattle trains.

Stalin saw the Koreans as a threat, as the peninsula's colonial ruler Japan was hostile to the Soviet Union -- although some of the deportees were exiles fighting for independence from Tokyo.

Moon thanked Uzbekistan, saying the country "warmly received citizens of Korean descent who lost their home more than 80 years ago," in the interview.

Moon is looking to reduce the reliance of the world's 11th-largest economy -- stuttering on 2.7 percent annual growth -- on traditional partners Beijing and Washington.

RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- Lawmakers filed legislation this week that would decriminalize marijuana possession of four ounces or less, while simultaneously raising the amounts that would qualify for a felony charge."Lots of people of color and young people are getting busted with possession with intent to sell and deliver. And they're not selling and delivering. What they're doing is purchasing it for their private use," said Representative Allison Dahle, one of the primary sponsors of House Bill 766 Currently, possession of 1.5 ounces or less is a misdemeanor, with anything above that a felony. If passed, anyone with possession of more than four ounces, but 16 ounces or less of marijuana, would receive a misdemeanor."There are tons of people in jail for a pound. And they're sitting in jail on sentences that are not doing anybody any good," Dahle said.Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C. have expansive medical marijuana programs, and 10 states and Washington, D.C. allow for recreational marijuana use."Yes it's illegal, but they don't need to be in our jails. It sets them up for the rest of their life struggling. It sets them up for not being able to get a job, having to check that box that says 'I have a criminal history,'" Dahle argued.North Carolina has an exception for "hemp extract" to treat intractable epilepsy, but strict medical marijuana use laws outside that.The legislation has the support of the North Carolina branch of NORML, which stands for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws."We have a lot of sponsors this year. More than any previous year," said Keith Caughran, who is part of the NORML Charlotte chapter, referencing the 12 additional sponsors signing on to the proposal.Dahle acknowledged they have not found any Republicans to support the proposal."What's going to get the Republicans to change their mind on this - I would say it would be a fiscal conservative argument that around North Carolina, a lot of the municipalities and counties, the police are spending tens of thousands of hours either on arresting people or issuing citations to them after they're caught during a traffic stop. So every hour that they spend on this, they can't spend rolling up the Opioid trafficking networks," Caughran said.Last month, a group of lawmakers filed HB 401 , specifically addressing medical marijuana.
Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy said the Congress-JD(S) alliance is expected to win 10-12 seats out of 14 Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka which are undergoing polling today during the second phase of general elections.

“Today I request all voters to go to the polling station and cast their vote, whatever decision you will take will form the future of the country. Please put your valuable vote and don’t miss it,” Kumaraswamy said after casting his vote here on Thursday.

“Elections are crucial for protecting the interest of the farming community. Out of 14 Lok Sabha seats, the JDS-Congress candidates may achieve 10-12 seats in this election,” he added.

Later, Kumaraswamy, while speaking to ANI, said, “Dynasty politics isn’t an important issue now, country’s problems are the main issue. Only because of dynasty politics and regional politics, this country developed in several states. We’re not bothered about criticism from BJP.”

DMK Chief MK Stalin, who cast his vote at a polling booth at SIET College in Teynampet, Chennai, alleged that the Election Commission is in connivance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government, adding that the EC would be reformed if the Opposition is voted to power.

“This year election has been full of Rs 500, 1000, 2000 and 10,000 currency notes. All attempts have been made to buy votes but in spite all this I have full faith in voters of Tamil Nadu who will exercise their democratic rights fairly,” Stalin told media here.

“Regarding the election issues, I can only request the EC but unfortunately the EC itself has become a party to the Modi-led government. People know this, therefore, we will thrive to reform EC once voted to power,” he added.

DMK Lok Sabha candidate from Thoothukudi, Kanimozhi, cast her vote at a polling station in Chennai’s Alwarpet. “People in the opposition have been harassed, raids targeted at opposition candidates. BJP has completely taken over AIADMK,” she told reporters after casting her vote.

Wheelchair-bound DMK General Secretary K Anbazhagan also cast his vote at a polling station in Mylapore, in Chennai South Parliamentary constituency.

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh cast his vote at a polling booth in Imphal, BJP candidate for Sivaganga constituency H Raja cast his vote at a polling station in Karaikudi, Sivaganga.

In Karnataka, RSS leader Dattatreya Hosabale cast his vote at polling station number 45 in Seshadripuram at Bengaluru, while Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and his wife Kannika Parameshwari cast their votes at a polling booth in Koratagere, Tumkur.

Meanwhile, PWD minister HD Revanna offered prayers at a temple in Paduvalahippe village in Hassan before casting his vote. His son Prajwal Revanna is contesting from Hassan.

Independent candidate from Bengaluru Central Prakash Raj cast his vote in Bengaluru. Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and Chief Minister V Narayanasamy also cast their votes.

Polling is being held in Lok Sabha constituencies of Assam (5), Bihar (5), Chhattisgarh (3), Jammu and Kashmir (2), Karnataka (14), Maharashtra (10), Manipur (1), Odisha (5), Tamil Nadu (38), Uttar Pradesh (8), West Bengal (3), and a single parliamentary seat of Puducherry.

Strada dei Parchi conferma la chiusura del traforo del Gran Sasso prevista per il 19 maggio, resta da sciogliere il nodo sulle responsabilità dell’inquinamento delle falde acquifere.

Prosegue il braccio di ferro tra Strada dei Parchi e gli enti coinvolti nella chiusura del traforo del Gran Sasso, prevista per il prossimo 19 maggio. Trenta giorni per la deadline, prima della quale si dovrà necessariamente trovare il mondo di sbloccare la situazione di stallo che si è venuta a creare a seguito delle contestazioni per l’inquinamento delle falde acquifere mosse dalla Procura di Teramo a Strada dei Parchi e Infn.

Non è infatti bastato il primo round che riguardava la competenza della messa in sicurezza delle falde a risolvere la questione. Il Ministero delle Infrastrutture ha messo nero su bianco che non è di competenza di Strada dei Parchi, ma viste le contestazioni in corso alla società non basta. Se c’è una contestazione a carico della concessionaria per l’inquinamento delle falde acquifere, la stessa si “autotutela” evitando di “reiterare” il reato ipotizzato, chiudendo il traforo. Come spiegato al Capoluogo.it dall’ufficio stampa di Strada dei Parchi, “il Ministero ha chiarito, come diceva la stessa società, che non è di nostra competenza la messa in sicurezza delle falde acquifere, ma qualcuno ci deve dire se possiamo andare avanti o no, visto che ci sono inchieste della magistratura”. Insomma, Strada dei Parchi vuole essere sicura che mantenendo aperto il traforo non rischi di “reiterare” le ipotesi di reato già contestate.

Nel frattempo, il sindaco dell’Aquila Pierluigi Biondi, ha chiesto alla Regione Abruzzo di attivarsi per chiedere il riconoscimento dello stato di emergenza, “affinché si proceda alla messa in sicurezza delle acque del Gran Sasso” e scongiurare “il rischio di chiusura del traforo del Gran Sasso. Un’eventualità, quest’ultima, che comprometterebbe la completa fruizione di una infrastruttura strategica per la città dell’Aquila e l’intero sistema delle aree interne che, altrimenti, dal 19 maggio rischiano di rimanere isolate con gravissime ripercussioni per il tessuto economico, sociale e, visto che siamo alle porte dell’estate, turistico”.

A mobilitarsi è anche il Presidente di Confindustria Abruzzo, Agostino Ballone: “Le problematiche inerenti gli sversamenti di sostanze pericolose sotto il traforo, oggetto di interesse della Procura di Teramo, ed i relativi costi per i lavori di rifacimento delle condotte di captazione e per l’impermeabilizzazione, necessari a mettere giustamente in sicurezza le falde acquifere, non possono e non devono trovare soluzione nell’interdizione traffico nelle gallerie del Gran Sasso di A24, in entrambe le direzioni di marcia. L’intera politica regionale, inoltre, in maniera unitaria, deve prendere posizione e agire in tempi rapidissimi, affinché si riesca a salvaguardare tutti gli interessi legittimi, e non si dia invece avvio all’attività dello scaricabarile che non farebbe altro che allungare colpevolmente i tempi per la ricerca delle soluzioni. Il Sistema Confindustriale abruzzese metterà in campo tutte le armi a sua disposizione volte a determinare una positiva evoluzione della vicenda e naturalmente è disponibile ad apportare il proprio contributo fattivo per raggiungere il traguardo di evitare in ogni modo la chiusura del Traforo del Gran Sasso”.

Ancora da verificare la posizione dei vertici regionali. Al momento non è possibile raggiungere telefonicamente il Presidente Marco Marsilio, fuori per qualche giorno, mentre il sottosegretario con delega a Trasporti pubblici e Mobilità, Umberto D’Annuntiis, ha assicurato che la settimana prossima, alla riapertura degli uffici, la richiesta del sindaco verrà valutata dalla Giunta regionale per le azioni conseguenti a scongiurare la chiusura.

Intanto “l’ultimatum” di Strada dei Parchi scadrà tra 30 giorni.
Hello Node.js lovers, in this post I’ll describe how to properly measure request duration in a Node.js + Express application. This topic is not new, but after googling for a while I found that even approved answers on StackOverflow are outdated and represent not an optimal way to measure requests duration. In the end of this post, you’ll be ready to use a generic middleware to measure the duration of every request in your app, even a terminated one.

First of all, let’s make some assumptions. By measuring requests duration I mean measuring only the time needed for processing a request by your app’s code. I ignore the time needed for DNS lookup and time spent inside TCP/IP stack. I think you couldn’t really affect a DNS lookup or TCP/IP time. It’s better to direct your efforts to your app’s performance, which you can improve significantly.

In terms of Express framework, we will measure the time of the request-response cycle. Let’s start with a simple boilerplate code, which has the fast method ( /fast ) which responds immediately and the slow one ( /slow ) which responds after 10 seconds.

const app = require('express')() // send response immediately app.get('/fast/', (req, res) => { res.sendStatus(200) }) // mock heavy load, send response after 10 seconds app.get('/slow/', (req, res) => { setTimeout(() => res.sendStatus(200), 10 * 1000) }) app.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Server started') })

With this boilerplate, we’re ready to dig into the matter of requests duration measuring.

The start point

The only one legit method to capture all the requests in Express framework is to implement a middleware function and load it before any other handlers, which means it will be the first to handle a request from a client. In other words, it will be our start point to measure the duration of a request. Let’s add a middleware function that logs the request url and the http verb.

app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl}`) next() })

And make a request to our test app:

> curl localhost:3000/fast/ GET /fast/

The end point

When does the request-response cycle end? The first and the obvious answer is when the response is sent. Node.js has a default event that is fired when the response has been sent. This hook is res.on('finish') .

99% of software developers use only “finish” event, but I should notice that not every request comes to the “finish” state, in the real life client can close the connection before the response has been sent. In this case Node.js emits only the res.on('close') event.

Personally, one of my client was constantly complaining on my api for not responding properly. For other clients everything was fine. After a few hours of digging into the problem I found that he misconfigured his timeouts, so he was closing his connections before the response was sent. If I’d used the “close” hook I would have nailed it in a few seconds, not hours.

Let’s add both hooks to our sample middleware and capture the “finish” and the “close” events:

app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [STARTED]`) res.on('finish', () => { console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [FINISHED]`) }) res.on('close', () => { console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [CLOSED]`) }) next() })

And make a few test requests

> curl localhost:3000/fast/ GET /fast/ [STARTED] GET /fast/ [FINISHED]

Notice that I added the -m 1 argument to the curl command to close the connection after 1 second

> curl localhost:3000/slow/ -m 1 GET /slow/ [STARTED] GET /slow/ [CLOSED]

Time measurement

Now we have request-response cycle start and end points, let’s measure the time between them.

The most popular approach is to use JavaScript Date class (e.g. Date.getTime() ), it can be found in many StackOverflow answers. However, it has several disadvantages such as limitation to milliseconds (hard to measure functions executing for a fraction of a millisecond) and a vulnerability to a clock drifts, this means new Date() relies on the system clock. For instance, if your system clock gets adjusted by an automatic clock adjustment job (which happens regularly in operating systems, google for the “NTP” phrase), the elapsed time between measures may not be correct.

So, to measure time we will be using high-resolution Node.js timer. Let’s add a call to capture the time at the start point of a request-response cycle and calculate the diff at the end point of the request-response cycle. I created a small helper function getDurationInMilliseconds to translate high resolution results to milliseconds. Check the modified middleware code below.

const getDurationInMilliseconds = (start) => { const NS_PER_SEC = 1e9 const NS_TO_MS = 1e6 const diff = process.hrtime(start) return (diff[0] * NS_PER_SEC + diff[1]) / NS_TO_MS } app.use((req, res, next) => { console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [STARTED]`) const start = process.hrtime() res.on('finish', () => { const durationInMilliseconds = getDurationInMilliseconds (start) console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [FINISHED] ${durationInMilliseconds .toLocaleString()} ms`) }) res.on('close', () => { const durationInMilliseconds = getDurationInMilliseconds (start) console.log(`${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} [CLOSED] ${durationInMilliseconds .toLocaleString()} ms`) }) next() })

The results:

> curl localhost:3000/fast GET /fast [FINISHED] 6.951 ms > curl localhost:3000/slow GET /slow [FINISHED] 10,007.288 ms

Sum up

That’s it. We created a middleware that captures all the requests and logs the duration of every request with the nanosecond precision. The full code of this sample app you can find on this GitHub page. Also if you’re interested in a Node.js middleware and request capturing I recommend you to read my previous post Counting requests in your Node.js + Express application

One of Northern Ireland's "most promising" journalists has been shot dead during rioting that police are treating as a terrorist incident.

Dissident republicans are being blamed for killing 29-year-old Lyra McKee after violence broke out during police searches in Londonderry on Thursday.

Police said a group known as the New IRA "are likely to be the ones" responsible for her murder.

Ms McKee's partner said she had been left without "the love of my life".

Sara Canning, speaking at a vigil in Derry, said the journalist's dreams had been "snuffed out by a single barbaric act".

Prime Minister Theresa May said the killing was "shocking and senseless".

Ms McKee was a journalist who "died doing her job with great courage", added Mrs May.

The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) described Ms McKee as "one of the most promising journalists" in Northern Ireland.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that a gunman fired shots towards police officers in Derry's Creggan area at about 23:00 BST on Thursday.

Mobile phone footage taken by a bystander during the rioting appears to show a masked gunman crouching down on the street and opening fire with a handgun.

Ms McKee, who was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle, was wounded.

"She was taken away from the scene in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin Hospital but unfortunately she has died," said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton.

The leaders of Northern Ireland's six biggest political parties said they were "united in rejecting those responsible for this heinous crime".

In a joint statement, they said: "Lyra's murder was also an attack on all the people of this community, an attack on the peace and democratic processes.

"It was a pointless and futile act to destroy the progress made over the last 20 years, which has the overwhelming support of people everywhere."

Detectives have started a murder inquiry and the PSNI's Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said "evil people" had been behind the killing.

Ms McKee's death has caused a "wave of shock and sympathy" and was "met with global condemnation, horror and revulsion", he added.

"The gunman and those who share his warped ideology should hang their heads in shame today - they represent no-one."

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said Ms McKee "changed lives" as a journalist and an activist and would continue to do so.

Irish people stood in "solidarity with the people of Derry" after the murder," he said.

"We stand with you as strong as your walls and for as long as they stand," he added.

"This was an attack not just on one citizen - it was an attack on all of us, our nation and our freedoms."

Ms McKee was a journalist of "courage, style and integrity" and a "woman of great commitment and passion", according to the NUJ's Séamus Dooley.

"I have no doubt that it was that commitment which led to her presence on the streets of the Creggan last night, observing a riot situation in the city," he added.

Filmmaker Alison Millar, who was due to have dinner with Ms McKee on Friday night, said her friend had been "stolen from us".

"Lyra was the most beautiful human being," she said.

"She was compassionate, she was honest, she was funny... she had so many friends and was loved by so many people."

Analysis by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI home affairs correspondent

Dissident republican activity has been increasing of late, with police in Northern Ireland fearful of a spate of violent incidents marking the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising.

An intelligence-led operation took them into Londonderry's Creggan estate late on Thursday night in a hunt for weapons and ammunition.

They were concerned they could be used in the days ahead to attack officers.

The group blamed for killing Lyra McKee is known as the New IRA and was behind a bomb attack outside the city's courthouse at the start of the year.

The violence on Thursday night broke out after police raids on houses in the Mulroy Park and Galliagh areas in Derry.

"Violent dissident republicans are planning attacks in this city and we were carrying out a search operation in Creggan," said the PSNI's Mr Hamilton.

Rioting began at Fanad Drive - more than 50 petrol bombs were thrown at police and two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire.

"I believe that this was orchestrated - orchestrated to a point that they just want to have violence and attack police," said Mr Hamilton.

"Bringing a firearm out is a calculated and callous act."

One reporter who was at the scene said a gunman "came round the corner and fired shots indiscriminately towards police vehicles".

"There were a number of houses with families - they had all spilled out on the street to see what was happening," added Leona O'Neill.

"There were young people, there were children on the street, there were teenagers milling about and a gunman just fired indiscriminately up the street."

Archbishop Eamon Martin, the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, tweeted to ask people to pray for Ms McKee's family.

By the end of April, and just shy of its 85th birthday, Denver’s Bonnie Brae Tavern could be one step closer to being razed and redeveloped.

According to city records, the owners of the restaurant at 740 S. University Blvd. earlier this month applied for non-historic status on their building. If approved, the certificate would exempt the tavern from further review if its owners decide to demolish it.

They can do so soon after the decision or up to five years later, Alexandra Foster of Denver Community Planning and Development told The Denver Post over email.

“By ordinance, all demolition applications are reviewed for historic potential regardless of whether they are designated landmarks or historic district properties,” she said. “This is done precisely to give the community an opportunity to speak up for beloved sites.”

But a family spokesman this week wouldn’t say what plans are for the restaurant.

“Whether we’re going to remodel, expand, sell … we’re just weighing our options at this point,” Michael Dire, a third-generation Bonnie Brae Tavern owner who owns the business with his sister and two cousins, told The Denver Post on Tuesday.

By applying for non-historic status, Dire said that his family was “just trying to find out where we stood” as they consider next steps for the building and their business.

But based on community response, the inquiry has “turned into a nightmare, let me tell you,” he added.

Dire said questions and concerns from customers started rolling in after Denver’s Landmark Preservation office posted a sign outside the tavern on April 9 notifying the public of the application process.

Community members have until April 30 to counter-apply for landmark designation in order to preserve the building, though applying without the owners’ consent comes with a fee of $875, according to the city’s application page. (Read more about the process in Westword.)

The landmark preservation office already has deemed Bonnie Brae Tavern potentially historic for its “direct association with development of the city,” and architectural features such as the iconic neon sign on its facade, according to a landmark preservation staff briefing. Its evaluation prompted the public response period.

“As one of the earliest commercial enterprises in the area, the Bonnie Brae Tavern grew with the neighborhood around it and became an integral part of the community during its 85 years of operation,” the city’s brief says.

If a formal landmark designation application is not filed by the end of the month, Bonnie Brae Tavern will get its non-historic status by May 8, according to the posted notice. That status would allow “demolition permits to be issued upon compliance with all state and city requirements,” it said.

But at the tavern, it’s business as usual, according to Dire.

“There’s nothing really going on,” he said, adding that the family is targeting June 6 and 7 for its 85th-anniversary celebration.

Bonnie Brae Tavern was built and opened in 1934, just after the repeal of Prohibition. The spot soon became a destination for families to get pizza in the community. By the time of second-generation owner Hank Dire’s death in 2012, his daughter Angela told The Denver Post that her father had considered Domino’s Pizza to be the family’s big competition.

At least 13 people have died and many were injured when a wall collapsed in South Africa at the start of an Easter service at a Pentecostal church.

Emergency services said that 29 people were rushed to hospital after the collapse in the coastal province of KwaZulu-Natal.

Local officials have blamed the tragedy on heavy rainfall in the area around eMpangeni on Thursday night.

Most of the victims were reportedly women sleeping in the church.

An 11-year-old girl is thought to be among them.

The wall at the front of the Pentecostal Holiness Church collapsed at the start of what had been planned as a weekend-long service to commemorate the Christian festival of Easter.

On Friday, a special prayer service was held in a large tent in front of the church, reports the eNCA TV station.

The Reverend Thulasizwe Buthelezi, the mayor of Zululand municipality, said the community was devastated and they would be praying for those affected by the tragedy.

"Christians [from] all denominations - we are here in solidarity. We are here to pray with the church, to pray with the families and to offer our support that God may really heal their wounds."

President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the church last year and some of the congregants reportedly asked for his support to build a new church.

Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant is a member of the church and was planning to attend the Good Friday service there.

She visited the scene and said: "Even at this difficult time, we still need to trust in God."

STRENGTHS

—Clean technician with ideal arm movement, lower body base and an easy, flawless whip through his throw. Can spin the ball well with an over-the-top motion and a fast release.

—At his best working over the middle of the field on short-to-intermediate throws; offers touch and timing to give receivers yards-after-the-catch ability.

—Played his best football down the stretch after gaining experience as a starter; attacked strong defenses vs. Michigan, Northwestern and Washington and came out with 14 touchdowns and only one interception. Teams should be encouraged by his in-season development and poise in big moments.

—Active in the pocket despite a lack of speed and lateral mobility; confident to hold his ground between the tackles and scan the field with a hop in his step.

—Stands tall in the pocket and is able to easily see over his line and find middle-of-the-field targets.

—Executed well on half-rollouts, especially to his right, where he showed good touch and accuracy on the move.

WEAKNESSES

—One-year starter at Ohio State with little exposure to NFL-style throws (i.e. downfield timing routes).

—Struggles to hit downfield throws due to limited arm strength and timing on his throws; doesn't have the arm to lead receivers deep and didn't attempt many shots down the field.

—Offers little to no threat as a runner; thick-bodied and doesn't show burst or quick-twitch movement.

—Can be slow to read coverage and can stall in the pocket trying to find his progressions. Needs more reps before he's ready to attack an NFL defense.

—Can get stuck on first read and linger in the pocket waiting for his man to come open. Will have to adjust to throwing into tighter windows with better timing.

OVERALL



Critics will tell you Dwayne Haskins benefited from tremendous yards-after-the-catch performances by his receivers, while supporters will say he made the right read and gave his man room to operate. That's how it goes with Haskins, who is a polarizing quarterback prospect because of his natural arm talent and poise but limited reps in college. NFL scouts will have a hard time pointing to success from quarterback prospects with so few starts in college, but Haskins' ability to throw on time and accurately, plus his poise and football IQ, add up to project a future-starter grade. Haskins would benefit from time to develop behind an established starter or being worked into an offense that relies on short and intermediate timing plays, like the Cincinnati Bengals or Washington Redskins.

For real life ghost story aficionados-and since 2013, even big screen supernatural movie buffs- no individuals are more prominent than Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo founded N.E.S.P.R., the New England Society for Psychic Research in 1952 and were involved in some of the most famous cases of hauntings of all time, including the infamous Amityville house, the Enfield poltergeist, and the Annabelle doll. They’ve been famously portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in a series of The Conjuring movies and spinoffs, which have only increased their presence worldwide over the past six years. Ed passed away on August 23rd, 2006, and Lorraine continued to help people around the world with the assistance of her son-in-law, Tony Spera. It is with heavy hearts that we report that an era has come to an end today, as Lorraine Warren has passed away at the age of 92.

Tony Spera and is wife Judy-Ed and Lorraine’s daughter- confirmed in a Facebook post that Lorraine, “died peacefully in her sleep at home last night.”

Here is a link to his entire post:

https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10219359699331355&id=1477354378

“It is with deep sadness that I must announce that Lorraine Warren has passed away.

She died peacefully in her sleep at home last night.

The family requests that you respect their privacy at this time.

Lorraine touched many lives and was loved by so many.

She was a remarkable, loving, compassionate and giving soul.

To quote Will Rogers, she never met a person she didn’t like. She was an avid animal lover and contributed to many animal charities and rescues. She was wonderful and giving to her entire family. May God Bless her.”

Tales of Lorraine assisting others in major, high profile cases through her knowledge of paranormal activity and her gift of clairvoyance can be found in countless books, movies, and television shows. What some may not know, however, is that Lorraine was always willing to help anyone who reached out to her- no matter how small their issue may have seemed in comparison to her major cases- never asking anything in return. She was known to take personal phone calls and offer advice to anyone in need of supernatural support. She was a positive presence in the community of the small town in Connecticut where Ed and she lived and established their Occult Museum, and a friendly face at the local businesses and post office she frequented.

It’s safe to say that there will never be a paranormal investigator as friendly, empathetic, kind, and interesting as Lorraine Warren, and her and Ed’s work will be forever remembered by anyone with even a passing interest in the supernatural. We here at the Horror News Network staff offer our condolences to the Spera family and the N.E.S.P.R. community, and we echo the family’s request for privacy at this time. May Mrs. Warren rest in peace, and may her values live on through the remembrance of her life’s work and her impact on the people she helped.
Donald Trump has launched an angry and expletive-laden tirade in response to statements about him revealed in the Mueller report into Russian involvement in his election as president.

The angry early morning outburst came after the release of the special counsel's findings revealed he had repeatedly attempted to obstruct justice, but that aides had refused to follow his instructions.

"Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue," he said.

Mr Trump's tweet included an unfinished sentence and ellipsis at the end, usually suggesting a further post is to follow. But at the time of publication, two hours had passed from the "bullshit" tweet with no follow-up appearing on his feed.

While Mr Trump did not indicate which notes or statements he was objecting to, the 400-page Mueller report includes a series of embarrassing claims about the president. Some of those are said to be taken from contemporaneous notes, including the suggestion he described himself as "f**ed" when the probe began.

"Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked," he said, according to notes from Jeff Sessions’ then-chief of staff, Jody Hunt.

Mr Trump had initially attempted to present the Mueller report as a complete exoneration. Just before it was announced, he posted another tweet to his feed, addressed to his "haters" in which he referenced Game Of Thrones and wrote "Game Over" and "No Collusion. No Obstruction".

A further statement from Mr Giuliani and Mr Trump's lawyers said "the report itself is nothing more than an attempt to rehash old allegations" and insisted that "the results of the investigation are a total victory for the president".

Donald Trump Jr, the president's eldest son, was featured prominently in the report for meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer at TrumpTower in June 2016.

Although the report said "the campaign anticipated receiving derogatory documents and information" from Russians that "could assist Trump's electoral prospects", it said "the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" that the participants at that meeting "had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful".

The younger Trump tweeted a series of attacks on Democrats. "Better luck next hoax!" he said.

Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that because the White House did not interfere with Mr Mueller's work, that "should make people feel good about democracy".

"We're accepting apologies today, too," Ms Conway told reporters, adding that Mr Trump watched Mr Barr, talked to his lawyers and was in "a great mood".

The president, who normally talks to reporters on his way out of the White House, declined to speak as he left to spend the Easter weekend in Florida.

But from Air Force One, he tweeted: "I had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone, including Mueller, if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn't!"

Appearing relaxed earlier on Friday at a military event, Mr Trump said a statue he had been presented with as a memento would have a permanent home "at least for six years, in the Oval Office".

As the audience applauded and laughed, Mr Trump said he was going to joke and say "at least for 10 or 14 years, but we would cause bedlam if I said that".

The NXIVM sex cult is facing allegations that it illegally bundled campaign donations to gain political favor with an unnamed US presidential election candidate and reports suggest that the politician is Hillary Clinton.

United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue asked a federal judge to introduce evidence showing that the defendants in the sex cult case had an “illegal scheme to exceed contribution limits to a presidential primary campaign.”

The court documents claim that witness testimony and documentary evidence will show that at least 14 NXIVM members, including five defendants, made the maximum campaign donation to a candidate, with the “understanding that they would be reimbursed by [Claire] Bronfman or Nancy Salzman,” who were involved in the cult. Salzman is the co-founder along with Keith Raniere.

The documents allege that an unnamed political operative, who has pled guilty to a New York state bribery charge about campaign contributions, suggested they bundle the contributions and present them to the candidate at a fundraising event attended by Salzman.

The US attorney claims a witness who was at the event will testify the contributions were made in the hope of getting political influence that included targeting Raniere’s enemies. He said that evidence of similar contributions to other elected officials will be introduced. Donoghue's request was made last month but has yet to receive a response.

“I was there, and I knew that the contributions were made by more than a dozen NXIVM members to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign,” he said.

A 2007 New York Post article reports NXIVM members donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential bid. On March 14 and April 13 of that year, over a dozen contributions were made to Clinton from NXIVM, many of which were from first-time donors giving the $2,300 maximum allowed.

One of the contributions came from Bronfman, who was charged in 2018 with money laundering and identity theft in connection with NXIVM activities. Salzman and Bronfman were members of Bill Clinton’s Clinton Global Initiative.

Bundling campaign donations is not illegal, but it can be used to circumvent campaign finance laws set out to prevent individuals from having undue influence over a candidate by donating huge amounts of money. If a bundler gathers individual donations from a group of people and presents them to a campaign, it can be seen as a way to show support and gain influence over a grateful candidate. The Center for Public Integrity reported that Obama rewarded about 200 bundlers with jobs and appointments after he won the election.

When bundlers encourage people to donate to a candidate with the promise of reimbursing them later, that is illegal, and that is what the court documents allege the NXIVM donors were promised.

A bright young journalist whose work focused on the legacy of violence in the Northern Ireland conflict, known as “the Troubles,” was killed Thursday night during riots in the border city of Londonderry.

Police had been carrying out raids against suspected militant Irish nationalists, and shots fired during the ensuing clashes struck the writer Lyra McKee, 29, of Belfast, authorities said.

It was a night of random gunfire and petrol bombs — like the nights from the old days, an echo to the years when Ireland was tearing itself apart.

But this is 2019, and it was broadcast on social media.

McKee’s last tweet on Thursday night showed a photograph of the rioting, with white police vans and black smoke rising in the distance.

“Derry tonight,” she wrote. “Absolute madness.”

Police opened a murder investigation and said they considered the shooting “a terrorist act.”

McKee was the first working journalist to be killed in the United Kingdom since 2001.

While the violence of the Northern Ireland conflict — between pro-British Protestant unionists and Irish Catholic republicans — mostly ended some 20 years ago, with the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, small numbers of opponents known as dissident republicans remain.

Many of these dissidents consider Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, as “occupied territory” and the Police Service of Northern Ireland as an illegitimate force. They reject the peace accord and continue to press — politically, but also with guns and bombs — for a unified Ireland.

The killing of a journalist during a police raid against republican extremists on the eve of Easter celebration shows how volatile the Irish borderlands still can be.

The shooting occurred as police moved into the heavily Irish nationalist neighborhood of Creggan in Londonderry, also known as Derry, on Thursday night.

“We believed that violent dissident republicans were planning attacks in this city, and we were looking for munitions and firearms that we believe may be about to be used across the Easter weekend,” Mark Hamilton, assistant chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, told journalists Friday.

Dissident republicans claimed responsibility for a car bomb that exploded in Londonderry’s city center in January. Police also blame the group for a string of murders and pipe bomb attacks. Members of the so-called New IRA are said by police to mingle republican politics with crimes such as drug dealing, prostitution and robbery — making them a kind of hybrid gang-militia.

As police moved into the Creggan neighborhood on Thursday, their vans were struck by gasoline bombs, bricks and fireworks.

“At 11 o’clock last night, a gunman appeared and fired a number of shots towards the police, and a young woman, Lyra McKee, 29 years old, was wounded” and later died, Hamilton said.

“We believe this to be a terrorist act. We believe this has been carried out by violent dissident republicans,” Hamilton said. He charged that New IRA members were most likely behind the killing.

Police released CCTV footage of the riot and encouraged witnesses to come forward.

“People saw the gunman and people saw those who goaded young people out onto the streets, people know who they are,” said Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation. “The answers to what happened last night lie within the community.”

A far-left, fringe republican political group called Saoradh issued a statement after the shooting, accusing the police of “waging a campaign of oppression.”

“The inevitable reaction to such an incursion was resistance from the youth of Creggan,” Saoradh said in a statement. “The blame for last night lies squarely at the feet of the British Crown Forces, who sought to grab headlines and engineered confrontation with the community,” it said.

“During this attack on the community, a Republican Volunteer attempted to defend people from the PSNI/RUC,” the statement continued, referring to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and its predecessor, the Royal Ulster Constabulary. “Tragically a young journalist covering the events, Lyra McKee, was killed accidentally while standing behind armed Crown Force personnel and armored vehicles. This outcome is heartbreaking and we extend our sincerest sympathy to the family, friends and loved ones of the deceased.”

Politicians across the spectrum condemned the shooting.

Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said: “Those people who carried out this attack have no place in society. Those people who carried out this attack do not have any support. Those people who carried out this attack have attacked all of us. They have attacked the community, attacked the people of Derry. They have attacked the peace process, and they have attacked the Good Friday Agreement.”

She added, “They should disband. They should desist.”

Arlene Foster, leader of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party, said: “It is absolutely heartbreaking. . . . Violence, criminality and terrorism was always wrong and is still wrong today in 2019. We condemn it wholeheartedly.”

Foster made the comments during a symbolically important first visit to the nationalist neighborhood, where she was warmly welcomed by a crowd of hundreds who gathered for a vigil.

McKee wrote a book about the “cold case” IRA killing of Robert Bradford, a politician from south Belfast, and was working on another about young people who disappeared during the Troubles.

She first gained attention for a blog post and subsequent short film, “Letter to my 14-year-old self,” describing her experience coming out as gay to her friends, family and especially her mother.

“Instead of getting mad, she will reply, ‘Thank God you’re not pregnant,’ ” McKee assured her younger self. “You will crawl in her lap, sobbing, as she holds you and tells you that you are her little girl, and how could you ever think that anything would make her love you any less. You will feel like a prisoner who has been given their freedom.”

McKee was named Sky News’s young journalist of the year in 2006, and Forbes magazine identified her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016.

John O’Doherty, director of the Rainbow Project, an advocacy group for LGBT people in Northern Ireland, hailed McKee as “a hero” who used “her own coming-out story to empower others to live as their most authentic selves.”

“To lose someone like Lyra at any age is a difficult thing to accept, but to lose her at 29 in such despicable and avoidable circumstances is devastating,” he said.

McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, said during the vigil on Friday afternoon that she had lost “the love of my life and the woman I was planning to grow old with.”

“Our hopes and dreams and all of her amazing potential was snuffed out by a single barbaric act,” Canning said. “This cannot stand.”

There has been concern that Brexit could exacerbate conflict along the Irish border. One of the points of contention in Britain’s exit plan is how to maintain the openness and invisibility of the border once Northern Ireland has left the European Union. The Republic of Ireland will remain an E.U. member.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was in Londonderry earlier this week, stressing her message to all sides that the turmoil of Brexit should never undermine the protections offered by the U.S.-brokered Good Friday Agreement.

Booth reported from London.

Dive Brief:

Taco Bell wants to end "calendar inequality" by getting rid of the Taco Tuesday tradition, according to an open letter published on its company blog. The reasoning is that the Yum Brands chain believes tacos should be celebrated and enjoyed on all days of the week rather than just one.

To rally fans to join the cause, the marketer is launching an advertising campaign called "Taco reBELLion" on April 21. The push includes a 60-second hero spot depicting three rival "taco gangs," the Hard Shells, the Soft Shells and the Los Locos, coming together to protest Taco Tuesday via a heavily '80s-influenced dance-off.

Taco Bell is also selling campaign-specific "Taco Any Day" merchandise, such as T-shirts and knit patches, through its online Taco Shop. The brand will integrate a promotional element as well, providing 15% off of one Party Pack purchased via its online portal or mobile app through June 8.

Dive Insight:

With the new advertising effort that encourages a rebellion against the calendar "inequality" and "bias" of Taco Tuesday, Taco Bell pokes fun at the socially and politically charged brand campaigns that are a hot industry trend at the moment. Taco Tuesday is a custom, whose origins are unclear, of going out to eat tacos or other Mexican food on Tuesdays, with restaurants often offering promotions on these days to lure in diners. In a press statement, Global Chief Brand Officer Marisa Thalberg said "it's time to challenge societal norms and for our fans and their friends to feel empowered to enjoy tacos without limits" in what reads as a riff on the lofty language more marketers are deploying to make an emotional connection with audiences that feel connected to causes, like millennials and Gen Z.

The Party Pack deal, reminiscent of the types of promotions that other Mexican dining brands run for Taco Tuesday, shows Taco Bell angling to drive more business through its online and mobile app offerings. The brand has put a sharper focus on building out a mobile and digital ordering business to keep up in a quickly evolving fast food category and reach tech-savvy and convenience-focused younger consumers.

Early last year, Taco Bell restructured its leadership team to accelerate growth in areas like e-commerce and the development of tools like self-service kiosks, delivery platforms and enhanced back-of-the-house systems. Parent company Yum Brands, which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut, is additionally seeking a "new senior leader" to oversee global, digital and technology strategy for the restaurant giant.

Interestingly, some of Taco Bell's recent successful efforts on the digital front have revolved around Taco Tuesday. The brand earlier this year worked with T-Mobile on T-Mobile Tuesday discounts, with the wireless carrier promoting the partnership through TV ads that ran during the Super Bowl. T-Mobile in February claimed the tie-up helped Taco Bell drive record high daily and hourly digital transactions, though specific figures were not broken out.

The merchandise play around "Taco reBELLion" similarly fits into a e-commerce trend that more fast food companies are pursuing and which Yum Brands has helped popularize. Taco Bell sells other gear, including sauce packets and wedding swag — the company operates special cantina locations that provide wedding services — through its Taco Shop, and has previously collaborated with fast-fashion marketer Forever 21 on a line of taco-themed clothing.
Mamma Mia! It's nearly time...

ABBA‘s Björn Ulvaeus has revealed that new music from the pop icons will arrive this autumn.

Last year, the Swedish pop group announced the intention to record new material – over 35 years on from their last foray into the studio. The tracks will arrive prior to a digital avatar tour which is set to take place this year. It was originally hoped that the songs would have emerged by Christmas 2018, but they have yet to materialise.

Ulvaeus told Denmark’s Ekstra Bladet tabloid that fans can expect a new song “in September or October”.

A new song titled ‘I Still Have Faith In You’ was due to premiere on the BBC back in December. Another new song is called ‘Don’t Shut Me Down’.

This comes after ABBA’s Bjorn Ulvaeus hinted that the band’s recent recording sessions could lead to “a new album, possibly.”

“Or four songs or something like that – that’s possible,” he continued, before repeating his insistence the band would not tour . “But for us to perform on stage that’s just not going to happen. That’s a definite.”

Last year, Ulvaeus also spoke about the direction of the two new songs.

“One of them is a pop tune, very danceable,” Ulvaeus said. “The other is more timeless, more reflective, that is all I will say. It is Nordic sad, but happy at the same time.

“I think that exuberant quality of the two ladies [Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad] together singing, that makes the saddest song a bit uplifting. I think that is what happens and that [it] is very organic: [it] isn’t calculated, [it] just happened that way.”

Ulvaeus added in the interview with Ekstra Bladet that the group’s planned avatar spectacular “has been delayed for too long”, saying that “it takes an extremely long time” to make the video with the avatars of the group members.
La última vez que Aitana vio a su hermana Andreas Fernández González con vida fue el lunes 24 de abril de 2017. “Beatriz Camporro, la doctora que estaba al cargo de Andreas, me cogió del brazo y me dijo: ‘Tu hermana es joven, tendrá que luchar por su vida”, recuerda Aitana. Andreas había ingresado en la unidad psiquiátrica del Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA) el viernes anterior. “Ahí supe que algo iba mal. Nadie muere, de repente, por un problema de salud mental”, añade Aitana.

Horas después, Andreas falleció. La autopsia reveló que su muerte se produjo por una meningitis linfocitaria sumada a una miocarditis. Ambas habrían sido consecuencia de una infección grave que no se diagnosticó ni trató adecuadamente, ya que fue considerada paciente psiquiátrica. Durante la mayor parte del ingreso —casi cuatro días—, Andreas estuvo atada a la cama. Su familia no pudo visitarla porque el hospital no lo permitió.

Según Aitana, Andreas debió ingresar en la UCI del hospital público, no en la unidad de psiquiatría. “Fuimos varias veces a urgencias porque ella tenía amigdalitis aguda y porque empezó a oír ruidos en su cabeza. Cuando vieron en los antecedentes familiares que mi madre tiene esquizofrenia, dieron por hecho que Andreas también tenía una patología mental. En realidad se estaba muriendo por una meningitis, que era la que causaba los ruidos que escuchaba. No hicieron nada para salvar su vida y por eso he denunciado a siete médicos por la vía penal, acusados de homicidio por imprudencia profesional grave”, afirma Aitana.

Cronología del caso Abril de 2017: Desde principios de mes, Andreas Fernández González, de 26 años, acude en varias ocasiones al ambulatorio. Le diagnostican amigdalitis aguda. Martes 18 de abril: Andreas acude dos veces al Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (HUCA). Primero, de madrugada, por la amigdalitis. Regresa por la tarde porque “escucha ruidos”. El informe de esta segunda consulta en urgencias reitera la amigdalitis aguda y placas pustulosas, pero incluye los antecedentes psiquiátricos de la madre de Andreas. Miércoles 19: Andreas acude de nuevo por “cuadro de ansiedad”. Jueves 20: Andreas regresa al HUCA. A las 22.58 ingresa de manera voluntaria en la unidad de psiquiatría. Viernes 21: Por la mañana, Andreas dice que quiere irse. La psiquiatra responsable del caso de Andreas considera necesario que siga internada por su estado de agitación, así que el ingreso se torna involuntario y se prescribe contención mecánica a las 13.38. Esta situación de privación de libertad se mantendrá desde esta hora hasta la muerte de Andreas. Sábado 22: El hospital comunica al juzgado de guardia el ingreso involuntario de la paciente a las siete de la tarde. Aunque esto, además de la contención mecánica, se había aplicado a las 13.38 del día anterior. Han pasado algo más de 30 horas, pese a que la ley obliga al hospital a informar antes de 24. Domingo 23: El forense de guardia visita a Andreas para valorar el ingreso involuntario. Lunes 24: El forense que había visitado a Andreas el día anterior para valorar el ingreso involuntario emite su informe favorable a la decisión del hospital. A primera hora de la tarde, Andreas entra en parada cardíaca y fallece a las 17.17. Martes 25: La jueza firma el informe elaborado por el forense sin saber que la paciente había fallecido el día anterior.





Aitana, de 23 años, presentó una denuncia tras la muerte de su hermana. “Mi primer abogado quería ir por la vía administrativa. Decidió no aportar el historial clínico, por lo que la juez determinó que se trataba de una muerte natural y el caso se cerró. Pero yo quería ir por la vía penal”. Así, Aitana, junto a una nueva abogada, Alejandra Gutiérrez, consiguió que el caso se reabriese en febrero de 2018: “Entonces sí presentamos la historia clínica completa y pedimos que declarasen los siete denunciados”, señala la letrada.

Andreas tenía 26 años cuando falleció el 24 de abril de 2017, era licenciada en Psicología y estaba opositando. “A principios de abril mi hermana empezó a encontrarse mal. Yo estaba de viaje y me escribía whatsapps diciendo: ‘Aitana, estoy muy malina’. En el ambulatorio le diagnosticaron una amigdalitis aguda y le pautaron antibióticos. Cada vez estaba peor. Cuando volví de viaje, como en el ambulatorio siempre le decían lo mismo, fuimos a urgencias del HUCA”.

La primera vez que Andreas acudió al HUCA fue en la madrugada del martes 18 de abril. El informe médico de ese día apunta que tenía “fiebre y amigdalitis desde hacía dos semanas” y que estaba tomando amoxicilina. Además de tener picos de fiebre, el análisis de sangre mostraba valores muy por encima de lo normal de la proteína C reactiva, de los leucocitos y de los neutrófilos.

Ese mismo día, por la tarde, Andreas volvió. Esta vez oía ruidos. “Refiere escuchar barullo, la alarma del móvil...” pero “haciendo crítica de irrealidad”, reza el informe. “En una persona previamente sana con un cuadro de alucinaciones auditivas de nueva aparición, es necesario descartar patología orgánica. Más aún si ese cuadro va acompañado de una infección, fiebre y leucocitosis con neutrofilia. Lo indicado en estos casos es realizar un hemograma, bioquímica, detección de drogas y una prueba de imagen (TAC)”, apunta una médica de urgencias que prefiere mantenerse en el anonimato. El informe reitera la amigdalitis aguda y placas pustulosas, pero incluye los antecedentes familiares como posible explicación a los ruidos que escuchaba y al estado de nerviosismo que presentaba: “Madre con esquizofrenia, padre con depresión mayor”, indica el documento médico.

Ruidos no reales

“Mi hermana sabía que esos ruidos no eran reales. Pesaron mucho más los antecedentes familiares que una posible enfermedad orgánica”, explica Aitana. El psiquiatra José María Fernández, excoordinador del Área de Salud Mental de Asturias, señala que “nunca se puede valorar la psicopatología que pueda tener una persona por lo que haya pasado a los familiares". Y añade: "En salud mental se necesita tiempo para valorar. Una alucinación puede deberse a distintos factores, algunos de ellos orgánicos”.

Tras recibir el alta, Andreas acudió de nuevo el miércoles de madrugada. ¿El motivo? “Cuadro de ansiedad”, según el informe. Se fue y volvió al día siguiente, el 20 por la noche: “Esos días mi hermana ya estaba muy nerviosa. Se notaba mal, desganada. Empezó a oír ruidos y no le hacían ninguna prueba. Cuando la vio la psiquiatra de guardia y dijo que la ingresaría en psiquiatría, a mi hermana le pareció bien porque pensaba: ‘Quiero estar protegida en un hospital, me harán las pruebas necesarias, verán que es algo orgánico y por fin sabrán qué me pasa”, señala Aitana. El diagnóstico de ingreso en la unidad de psiquiatría —informe que incluye de nuevo el antecedente materno de esquizofrenia— es de “episodio disociativo y personalidad frágil”.

A pesar de que Andreas ingresó voluntariamente, al día siguiente —viernes 21 por la mañana—, quiso irse. “Comienza una escalada de gritos y quejas. Da patadas en la puerta y exige que la dejemos irse. Imposible tener una conversación con ella”, apunta el informe médico. Y ahí es cuando el ingreso voluntario se tornó involuntario y se prescribió contención mecánica (atar a un paciente).

“Ese día llamé al hospital. La psiquiatra Beatriz Camporro, que estaba al cargo de mi hermana, me dijo que le habían aplicado contención mecánica. Yo quería sacarla de allí, pero me dijo que la potestad sobre ella ahora la tenía el hospital”, explica Aitana.

Este periódico ha tratado de conocer la versión de Camporro sobre el caso de Andreas y sobre los protocolos en la unidad de psiquiatría, ya que además es la directora del Área de Salud Mental. Ha rehusado hablar. También Pablo Muñiz, director del HUCA, y José Ángel Arbesú, responsable de coordinación de Salud Mental de Asturias, han rechazado hablar. El comité de ética del HUCA, encargado de analizar la labor asistencial a los pacientes, no ha respondido.

El resto de médicos denunciados tampoco ha hecho declaraciones. Su representante legal, Javier Álvarez, abogado de todos ellos, ha explicado que la de Andreas es “una muerte súbita, como puede haber muchas”. “Cuando es una persona joven es más desgraciado, pero la vida es así. No hay ninguna negligencia médica”, añade Álvarez.

Andreas permaneció atada a la cama desde el viernes 21 —a las 13.38, según el informe médico— hasta el momento de su muerte, el lunes 24 de abril a primera hora de la tarde. Es decir, unas 75 horas seguidas sin poder moverse. El psicólogo Emilio López Navarro, cuya tesis doctoral critica el trato que se da a los pacientes con diagnósticos de salud mental, apunta que “el reflejo humano es escabullirse o revolverse cuando quiere hacer un movimiento y no le dejan: la contención mecánica es una barbaridad, sobre todo si es prolongada en el tiempo”. Según la autopsia, Andreas sufrió erosiones en los codos al intentar liberarse de las ataduras.

Según la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil, el hospital tiene obligación de informar al juzgado competente lo antes posible del ingreso involuntario (así como de cualquier medida que suponga la privación de libertad del paciente, como sería la contención mecánica), pero siempre en un plazo máximo de 24 horas. Según consta en los documentos aportados durante la fase de instrucción, el hospital no informó hasta el sábado a las siete de la tarde, cuando habían transcurrido alrededor de 30 horas desde que el ingreso de Andreas se tornase involuntario y de que fuese atada a la cama, excediendo así el plazo que marca la ley. El forense que evaluó a Andreas acudió el domingo 23 y emitió su informe favorable a la decisión del hospital la mañana del día siguiente. La juez firmó la autorización el martes 25, sin saber que Andreas había fallecido el día anterior. “El hospital ni siquiera avisó al juzgado de que mi hermana había muerto”, apunta Aitana.

El viernes por la noche, Andreas llega al nivel de “postración” por efecto de la medicación (antipsicóticos y antidepresivos), según recoge el informe médico. “El agua le cae por las comisuras de los labios, no traga, no responde a estímulos verbales”, figura en el documento.

El sábado 22, Andreas pasó prácticamente todo el día dormida y febril, según el informe. El domingo, también: “Se encuentra muy somnolienta, no responde a estímulos verbales ni táctiles. No es posible realizar entrevista”, señala en el informe la psiquiatra de guardia del domingo, quien pidió un TAC y una analítica. “Ese domingo llamé y pedí hablar con la psiquiatra de guardia. Le dije: ‘Por favor, hacedle alguna prueba. Tiene algo orgánico’. Esto se lo decíamos a los médicos. La psiquiatra me dijo, por fin, que iba a pedir un TAC. En teoría, se lo iban a hacer el lunes 24, pero ya fue muy tarde. Si se lo hubiesen hecho el domingo, habrían visto que tenía meningitis y mi hermana quizá seguiría viva”, relata la hermana.

Luchar por su vida

El lunes por la mañana Aitana acudió al hospital: “Cuando llegué, Beatriz Camporro, que había vuelto tras el fin de semana, me dijo que le diese un beso a mi hermana. Y que Andreas tendría que luchar por su vida. Me dio un ataque de ansiedad y me tiré al suelo. Le decía: ‘¿Qué habéis hecho? ¡Os dije que tenía algo orgánico!’. Ella me dijo: ‘Aquí no estamos para tratarte a ti, sino para tratar a tu hermana”.

Aitana se fue a casa tras despedirse de Andreas sin saber que ya no volvería a verla viva. Horas después, sonó el teléfono: Andreas estaba en parada cardiaca. “No estaba monitorizada, así que tardaron media hora en darse cuenta de que estaba en parada”.

El proceso está en fase de instrucción a la espera del informe forense final. Hay siete médicos denunciados e investigados por “homicidio por imprudencia profesional grave” que ya han declarado en el juzgado: “Hubo una dejación total de funciones. No es que pusiesen medios para ver qué le pasaba y aun así no diesen con la causa. Es que no le hicieron pruebas, a pesar de que ella siempre decía que tenía algo orgánico”, relata Aitana. “Cuando la gente sabe que una persona tiene un problema psiquiátrico, ya no la ve del mismo modo. Y los profesionales, tampoco. No es lo mismo que proteste alguien que no tiene nada a que lo haga alguien con un diagnóstico de psicosis. Le restamos credibilidad”, valora el psiquiatra José María Fernández.

Han pasado dos años, pero es abril de nuevo. Sentada en el mismo piso que compartía con su hermana, Aitana se pregunta qué podría haber hecho ella para que nada de esto hubiese ocurrido. Pero la respuesta es siempre la misma: “Fue el ego de los médicos lo que pudo con la vida de mi hermana”.

WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., on Friday subpoenaed the Justice Department for the full, unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report as well as the underlying evidence.

In a statement, Nadler said that the Justice Department must comply by May 1.

"I am open to working with the Department to reach a reasonable accommodation for access to these materials, however I cannot accept any proposal which leaves most of Congress in the dark, as they grapple with their duties of legislation, oversight and constitutional accountability," he said Friday.

The subpoena comes a day after Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version of the report to Congress and to the public, which details Trump's attempts to muddy the special counsel's probe, including efforts to tamper with witnesses, and the decision not to charge him with obstruction of justice in part because there was no underlying crime and many of the attempts were carried out in plain view.

The report also laid out numerous contacts between members of Trump’s presidential campaign and Russians, but said investigators found Trump’s team had not “conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

The report contained nearly 1,000 redactions, with seven entire pages blacked out. Nadler's committee voted in early April to authorize the subpoena for the report ahead of its release after Barr laid out the areas he intended to black out.

Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, called Nadler's subpoena "wildly overbroad" and said the date Nadler required the Justice Department to respond was "politically convenient" given that Barr had offered to appear before the committee on May 2.

"The chairman's process flies in the face of normal and proper congressional oversight. I urge Chairman Nadler to narrowly tailor his subpoena and give the department a meaningful chance to respond," Collins said in a statement Friday.

Nadler confirmed Friday that Barr would testify on May 2, telling WNYC in an interview on "The Brian Lehrer Show" that he hoped to have Mueller before the panel by May 23.

"We will have other witnesses obviously, but we have to hear from the two of them," Nadler said.

In a letter Thursday to Nadler and his Senate counterpart, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Barr said that he would offer them and other top lawmakers the chance to review a less redacted version of the report next week in a “secure reading room.”

Department of Justice Spokesperson Kerri Kupec called the subpoena "premature and unnecessary" in a statement Friday, given Barr's offer.

“In the interest of transparency, the Attorney General released the Special Counsel’s 'confidential report' with only minimal redactions. The Department of Justice has also made arrangements for Chairman Nadler and other Congressional leaders to review the report with even fewer redactions. In light of this, Congressman Nadler’s subpoena is premature and unnecessary. The Department will continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognized executive branch interests," Kupec said.

But top House and Senate Democrats — Nadler, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein and Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner — on Friday said the proposal for a restricted review was unsatisfactory.

"Unfortunately, your proposed accommodation—which among other things would prohibit discussion of the full report, even with other Committee Members—is not acceptable," the members wrote in a letter to Barr rejecting his offer.

They added that they are "open to discussing a reasonable accommodation with the Department that would protect law enforcement sensitive information while allowing Congress to fulfill its constitutional duties."

Following the release of the 448-page report Thursday, Nadler said that it outlines “disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct” and that Congress now has the responsibility to hold the president accountable.

Nadler also sent a letter to Mueller on Thursday requesting that he testify about the report before Congress “as soon as possible” or “in any event, no later than May 23, 2019,” tweeting that lawmakers "need to hear directly from special counsel Mueller and receive the full, unredacted report with the underlying evidence.”

Nadler, who in March said he had a “high bar” for impeachment, on Thursday did not rule out that scenario. His committee has the power to initiate an impeachment inquiry and proceedings.

Asked if holding Trump accountable means impeachment, Nadler said, "That's one possibility — there are others."

Several rank and file House Democrats, including several freshmen members, began to voice support for pursuing impeachment or at least raised the possibility of going in that direction. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted Thursday that she plans to sign onto an impeachment resolution that has been introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. She said Mueller's report "squarely puts this on our doorstep."

Another freshman Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., tweeted Thursday night, “In times of great consequences, let’s be clear. #TimetoImpeach #MuellerReport.”

"Now we need the unredacted report, we need the evidence. The American people deserve the truth. And Congress will come to its determination about obstruction of justice and the possibility of impeachment,” tweeted freshman Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa.

Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., was asked by reporters if the instances of possible obstruction laid out in the report could lead to a case of impeachment in the House.

“Yeah, I think that they absolutely could,” he said. “There's one, pretty devastating quote by Mueller himself who said if the FBI had, was willing to dig deep on it all, it would certainly lead to obstruction charges.”

Congress currently remains on recess for the Passover and Easter holidays through next week, and Pelosi wrote in a letter to members of her caucus Thursday evening that she has scheduled a conference call for Monday “to discuss this grave matter, which is as soon as our analysis and this Holy Season’s religious traditions allow.”
Danielle Jenkins has spent her whole life struggling to breathe.

The 17-year-old high school senior grew up with asthma and requires daily medication to keep her respiratory system functioning normally. If Jenkins strays from her routine she knows the consequences: shallow breaths, rescue inhaler puffs and — in extreme cases — hospital trips.

She is one of more than 700,000 New Jerseyans who suffer from asthma. Another 300,000 more live with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

That’s one million people whose airpaths may become even more constricted as climate change heats the Garden State at a staggering pace.

Since 1970, New Jersey has experienced a 3°F increase in annual average temperatures, making it one of the fastest-warming states in the nation, Climate Central analysts found when examining temperature records. The last 20 years have seen 11 of the state’s 15 hottest summers, according to state climate records that date back to 1895. The state’s warming is largely the result of greenhouse gas-driven climate change and urban development.

While New Jersey’s escalating temperatures magnify the risks of damaging storms and flooding — both well-documented consequences of climate change — the hazards of declining air quality are less widely discussed.

This warming trend, combined with pollution from cars, power plants and chemical plants, is expected to increase the number of days each year that Garden State residents inhale unsafe levels of ozone pollution, also called smog.

“A weight on my chest”

Ozone is most commonly known as the layer of gas that wraps around the Earth in the stratosphere – tens of thousands of feet above the planet’s surface — and protects against skin cancer and other impacts from ultraviolet sunlight.

But ozone resting near the Earth’s surface is synonymous with smog. It forms when gases from tailpipe and smokestack pollution mix in the air and combine in hot, sunny conditions. Ozone attacks the lungs -- some people describe ozone pollution as “sunburn for the lungs.”

That’s why summer days — especially the extremely hot ones with heavy, still air — can be tougher for people like Jenkins.

“If I don’t take my medication, I feel like a weight on my chest because of the heat,” Jenkins said.

New Jersey currently experiences about 22.5 days each year when outdoor air has too much ozone, according to Luis Lim, the chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Air Monitoring, referring to annual averages from 2015-2018.

The problem was once much worse. Lim said the highest ozone levels peaked in New Jersey in 1990, when they were nearly twice as high as last year’s.

The federal Clean Air Act, passed in 1970, successfully lowered the rampant amount of air pollution nationwide. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide, a key ingredient for ozone, have dropped in the U.S. by more than 40 percent, and ozone levels have dropped by 32 percent since 1980.

But now, climate change threatens to undo some of the progress made.

Hotter weather combined with population growth — driven by suburbs in the 1980s and ‘90s and by urban centers more recently — and steadily rising motor vehicle use on New Jersey’s roads boost the ingredients for smog formation.

Loretta Mickley, a senior research fellow at Harvard University, concluded in a 2016 Geophysical Research Letters study that unhealthy ozone days in parts of the U.S. would increase up to a week each year by 2050 — unless far-reaching measures are taken to reduce heat-trapping pollution from fossil fuels and other industrial activities.

Mickley’s model predicts that New Jersey will experience twice as many annual ozone days by 2050.

“If we keep the ozone precursors constant, and the climate warms, then we’re going to run into trouble again, we’re going to have the dirty air that we had 30 years ago, before the Clean Air Act.” Mickley said. “We’ve made all this good work cleaning the air and now all that good work may be undone by climate change.”

“No child should die of asthma”

Dr. Evelyn Montalvo-Stanton, Jenkins’ doctor, is surrounded by the consequences in Essex County, where she works as a West Orange-based pediatric pulmonologist for RWJBarnabas Health.

“I’ve seen children die of asthma in the city of Newark,” she said. “No child should die of asthma.”

The New Jersey Department of Health reports an average of about 100 deaths from asthma each year, with asthma-related emergency room visits highest in Essex, Camden, and Cumberland counties; while lowest in Morris, Somerset, and Hunterdon.

The state has seen a steep decline in number of asthma-related ER visits since 2009, but a sizable number of residents with respiratory issues are still struggling. NJDOH data shows that for every 10,000 residents, 7.3 ended up in the emergency room in 2017.

Yet those numbers only capture the worst cases of respiratory attacks; they don’t account for the episodes managed without hospitalization.

The people put most at-risk by ozone pollution are those with respiratory problems or heart disease, children and the elderly. Urban areas like Hudson County, where Jenkins goes to school, are heavily affected, but the rest of New Jersey faces a growing problem as well. The American Lung Association’s 2018 State of the Air report gave failing grades to 11 of the Garden State’s 21 counties.

In one sense, Jenkins is lucky. Her mother is a nurse, and she’s been seeing Dr. Montalvo-Stanton for years.

But not everyone has the understanding or the means to properly manage their breathing troubles. Asthma and respiratory problems are more dangerous for low-income people, according to, Dr. Afif El-Hasan, who works as a pediatrician and national spokesperson for the American Lung Association.

“Treating and trying to prevent asthma is costly, and if you can’t do that, then it becomes even more costly for the individual and for society in general,” said Dr. El-Hasan. “Ozone causes increased mortality rates for asthma, increased cardiovascular disease and increased premature babies.”

What is being done

Air quality is regulated on the federal level, with a regional approach based largely on metropolitan areas. New Jersey is split into two regions — North Jersey is considered part of the New York City region, and South Jersey part of the Philadelphia region.

The EPA last adjusted ozone standards in 2015, and new standards may be set soon. The federal agency said its review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone is underway; “with a goal of finalizing any necessary revisions to the standard, including averaging time, by the end of 2020.”

But that assessment of potential changes to air quality regulations is being undertaken by an EPA that, under President Donald Trump, has taken steps to rollback environmental protections.

Last October, for example, the New York Times reported the EPA disbanded a panel that gave advice on what the federal air standards for particulate matter, or soot, should be.

Environmental Defense Fund health scientist Ananya Roy said the current federal standards aren’t strict enough to prevent serious impacts on human health, citing a 2017 Harvard study that found long-term exposure to ozone—at concentrations below current EPA standards—can sicken Medicare recipients, risking death. An urban epidemiologist, Roy leads research to inform air quality advocacy initiatives by the national environmental group.

“Not only are people who are already asthmatic having higher rates of asthma exacerbations and symptoms,” Roy said. “Long term, ozone averages have actually had an impact on mortality.”

At the state level, action is being taken by Governor Phil Murphy’s administration to try and cut back on ozone pollution in the Garden State.

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is in the process of handing out grants to transportation projects across the state meant to get dirty engines out of service, and replace them with electric options where possible. The program is funded by $72.2 million awarded to the state as part of a massive settlement paid out by Volkswagen for the carmaker’s emissions cheating scandal.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal made headlines in January when he joined a multi-state lawsuit against the EPA, blaming the agency for inaction by failing to set stricter emission standards for states whose coal-burning power plants blow pollution across state lines.

And last summer, Grewal joined a different lawsuit against the EPA to keep “super-polluting” trucks called gliders off the road. A week after that lawsuit was filed, the EPA changed its course.

New Jersey and other governments worldwide have been taking modest steps to slow warming, but both American and global greenhouse gas emissions increased from 2017 to 2018. As New Jersey gets hotter, the simple act of breathing will remain a challenge for people like Jenkins.

“I guess being 17, it bothers me because it’s the world I’m going to have to live in and be an adult in,” Jenkins said.

Next year, Jenkins plans to start school at Spelman College in Atlanta. She’s excited, but she knows her asthma is unlikely to cooperate.

“It’ll just be more dirty air that I have to breathe in.”

The NXIVM sex cult is facing allegations that it illegally bundled campaign donations to gain political favor with an unnamed US presidential election candidate and reports suggest that the politician is Hillary Clinton.

United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard Donoghue asked a federal judge to introduce evidence showing that the defendants in the sex cult case had an “illegal scheme to exceed contribution limits to a presidential primary campaign.”

The court documents claim that witness testimony and documentary evidence will show that at least 14 NXIVM members, including five defendants, made the maximum campaign donation to a candidate, with the “understanding that they would be reimbursed by [Claire] Bronfman or Nancy Salzman,” who were involved in the cult. Salzman is the co-founder along with Keith Raniere.

The documents allege that an unnamed political operative, who has pled guilty to a New York state bribery charge about campaign contributions, suggested they bundle the contributions and present them to the candidate at a fundraising event attended by Salzman.

The US attorney claims a witness who was at the event will testify the contributions were made in the hope of getting political influence that included targeting Raniere’s enemies. He said that evidence of similar contributions to other elected officials will be introduced. Donoghue's request was made last month but has yet to receive a response.

“I was there, and I knew that the contributions were made by more than a dozen NXIVM members to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign,” he said.

A 2007 New York Post article reports NXIVM members donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential bid. On March 14 and April 13 of that year, over a dozen contributions were made to Clinton from NXIVM, many of which were from first-time donors giving the $2,300 maximum allowed.

One of the contributions came from Bronfman, who was charged in 2018 with money laundering and identity theft in connection with NXIVM activities. Salzman and Bronfman were members of Bill Clinton’s Clinton Global Initiative.

Bundling campaign donations is not illegal, but it can be used to circumvent campaign finance laws set out to prevent individuals from having undue influence over a candidate by donating huge amounts of money. If a bundler gathers individual donations from a group of people and presents them to a campaign, it can be seen as a way to show support and gain influence over a grateful candidate. The Center for Public Integrity reported that Obama rewarded about 200 bundlers with jobs and appointments after he won the election.

When bundlers encourage people to donate to a candidate with the promise of reimbursing them later, that is illegal, and that is what the court documents allege the NXIVM donors were promised.

Paris (CNN) The bees that live on the roof of Notre Dame are alive and buzzing, having survived the devastating fire that ripped through the cathedral on Monday, the beekeeper Nicolas Geant confirmed to CNN.

"I got a call from Andre Finot, the spokesman for Notre Dame, who said there were bees flying in and out of the hives which means they are still alive!" Geant said. "Right after the fire I looked at the drone pictures and saw the hives weren't burnt but there was no way of knowing if the bees had survived. Now I know there's activity it's a huge relief!"

Notre Dame has housed three beehives on the first floor on a roof over the sacristy, just beneath the rose window, since 2013. Each hive has about 60,000 bees.

Geant said the hives were not touched by the blaze because they are located about 30 meters below the main roof where the fire spread.

"They weren't in the middle of the fire, had they been they wouldn't have survived," Geant said. "The hives are made of wood so they would have gone up in flames."

The world’s media has rarely paid as much attention to Venezuela as it has in 2019. If you’re reading this and want to know more about the country’s crisis, a wealth of information is likely at your fingertips. Each new low in Venezuela’s economic collapse, which has left 9 out of 10 people unable to afford food, and each new twist of its political drama — as two men continue to claim to be president — has been documented and analyzed in painstaking detail across magazines, newspapers and TV screens.

But for Venezuelans inside the country, just finding out what’s going on around them has become a struggle.

As Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government has overseen Venezuela’s collapse into unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis since 2014, it has tried to restrict citizens’ access to information. Most television is state-run, and authorities ban the few independent TV and radio stations from covering Venezuela’s crisis as it unfolds: in widespread power outages, food and medicine shortages, and protests led by the opposition. Unable to afford the paper to print on, newspapers and magazines have all but disappeared.

As a result, the Internet is the last place Venezuelans can turn for non-government sanctioned information. It’s also the opposition’s only way to organize — and that means it has become a key battleground in the fight for control of Venezuela. Authorities regularly block news outlets and social media or arrest critics who speak out online, while underfunded web infrastructure has slowed connection speeds to near unusable levels. But a network of activists and former journalists are fighting back. Creating underground news services on WhatsApp, and teaching the less tech-savvy to navigate restrictions, they are keeping information flowing around the country. “Most Venezuelans are in the dark, starving for information,” says Andrés Azpúrua, director of Internet freedom watchdog VE Sin Filtro (Venezuela Without Filter). “People are working really hard to get [it] to them.”

Venezuela's National Assembly head and self-proclaimed "acting president" Juan Guaido (C) speaks to the press after attending a mass in honour to the fallen in the fight for freedom, political prisoners and the exiled, at the San Jose church in Caracas on January 27, 2019.

Venezuela’s Internet freedom has been weakening for several years, with the country finally dropping from “partly free” to “not free” in annual reports by global democracy monitor Freedom House in 2017 – the year widespread protests broke out amid worsening living conditions caused by a drop in the global oil price and economic mismanagement.

But Azpúrua says censorship has “accelerated rapidly” since January this year, when Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s opposition-held parliament, staked a claim on the presidency. Guaidó argued that Maduro’s second term, won in rigged elections in 2018, was invalid, and that the constitution mandated he take charge temporarily. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans rallied in the streets to show support for his claim, while the U.S. and 50 other mostly Western countries have recognized Guaidó as president. Maduro retains the backing of key allies Russia, China and Turkey and, crucially, of the Venezuelan military.

Venezuela is now subject to frequent information blackouts — periods of prolonged and widespread censorship that tend to occur precisely when the eyes of the world’s media are drawn to Venezuela. On the weekend of February 22, for example, as Guaidó supporters faced off with the military in an attempt to bring aid into Venezuela from Colombia, the dominant state-run internet service provider blocked Youtube and other streaming websites along with a number of domestic and foreign news outlets, according to VE Sin Filtro. Several online-only news broadcasters, which became a popular alternative to heavily censored television news during the 2017 protests, were blocked during the border face-off and have been inaccessible on most Internet service providers since.

Almost every time Guaidó livestreams a speech on Instagram, Youtube or Periscope, the site will go down precisely when he starts, Azpúrua says. Authorities used to block sites with simple DNS (Domain Name System) blocking; under orders from the government, Internet service providers stopped connecting users to requested sites. As more and more people began to use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to encrypt web traffic and stop it being intercepted, the government got more sophisticated, Azpúrua says, and started blocking VPN services too. “They haven’t won the war. But they’re definitely gaining ground.”

The most visible face of the movement fighting back against censorship is Caracas-based Luis Carlos Díaz. A tech journalist, radio host and self-described “child of the Internet,” Díaz has become known for advising his large online following on how to use alternative services or proxy servers, and what to do during information blackouts. In March, state television claimed one of his videos on information blackouts — released a few weeks before an actual electrical blackout cut power across Venezuela for several days — proved he was involved in a U.S.-backed cyber attack to bring down the electric grid. (Maduro has offered no evidence of U.S. involvement and experts at the Central University of Venezuela’s electrical engineering department have blamed a bush fire for triggering the collapse of the chronically underfunded grid.)

On March 11, four days into the blackout, intelligence agents stopped Díaz as he was cycling home and placed a hood over his head before bundling him into a car. He was taken to the Helicoide, a space-age building in south-central Caracas that over the last five years has become a notorious holding center for political prisoners. Intelligence agents detained him for 30 hours, while refusing to tell his wife and fellow journalist Naky Soto, who is suffering from cancer, if they had him in custody. Media and human rights organizations around the world, including U.N. human rights commissioner and former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet, demanded answers. Some thirty hours later, agents set free Díaz free, with orders to report back every eight days and not to talk about his case.

Venezuelan authorities regularly detain journalists, claiming that they have entered the country illegally or breached “security zones”, or citing a vaguely worded “law against hatred” passed in 2017. But journalists are not the only target. Last April, intelligence agents arrested three teenagers who used Facebook to invite friends to a protest, according to Human Rights Watch. In May, Pedro Jaimes Criollo, who runs a Twitter account tracking weather and aviation data, disappeared for 33 days after he shared the route that the presidential plane was taking in a post about how few aircraft were flying. (The president’s route was already publicly available on air traffic sites.) Local media said in February that Jaimes Criollo was still in the Helicoide awaiting trial on national security-related charges.

By detaining social media users, even ones without apparently political motives, Díaz says officials are trying to prove their loyalty to those higher up the chain of command. “Everyone has their kind of quota of people to detain and then show to the regime, like a trophy,” he tells TIME, speaking over the phone from Caracas. “They can say “I have caught this conspirator, this terrorist.” It doesn’t matter to them if it’s true.”

Journalists are facing these kinds of risks for pitiful salaries. While a foreign correspondent working in Caracas for U.S. media may be making hundreds or thousands of dollars each month, Díaz says the average Venezuelan journalist earns just $5 or $10 working for an independent outlet. “It might not seem important, but it makes it really hard to do your job when you’re hungry all the time, or you can’t afford to buy medicine for your family,” Díaz says.

Still, many are determined to get information out there. “People are thinking outside the box to deliver the news to different communities,” Azpúrua says. One of the most eye-catching methods has been Bus TV, in which journalists stand on public buses, reading out headlines, holding a TV-like frame around their faces. The idea is partly to inform the public, and partly to protest censorship.

More practically, activists and journalists, some working in exile, have set up services like Información Pública to produce short audio news bulletins, distributed as WhatsApp voice notes or on SoundCloud. Other upstart news services, like ¿Qué está pasando? (What’s Going On?), share images of text that people can save to their phones for when the internet cuts out. These underground news bulletins are shared on “huge distribution lists,” Azpúrua says. “People who have signed up receive [the bulletins] and share them with their friends, and so on, so it goes viral.”

But, as in other countries where social media has become a source of news, it’s hard to prevent the spread of disinformation. According to Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, false stories have gone viral online about the military conscripting minors and about Russian troops arriving in Venezuela, praying on people’s fears over where the political crisis could go next. The widespread use of large WhatsApp groups to share news stories has facilitated this trend, analysts say, because the app’s encrypted and privately-shared messages don’t allow journalists or fact-checkers to see them and question inaccuracies. It also makes people more likely to read news stories on their phone, where it is harder to spot the signs of an illegitimate source. A similar phenomenon has taken place in India and Brazil, where WhatsApp is also commonly used to share news.

It’s not clear who is behind the false stories. Some of them may be created by opposition groups, while others, Díaz says, come from the regime. “The government has created its own teams, parallels of [offline pro-government gangs] the colectivos, for sharing false stories,” he says. The aim isn’t only to manipulate people with pro-government stories, but also to generally discredit the few remaining news outlets that claim to be credible. “It muddies the waters. It’s a very sophisticated strategy.”

The cumulative impact, Díaz says, is a population in the dark – a boon for the regime. “If people can’t access information, it makes them feel isolated, like all their problems are just individual. That makes them less likely to protest,” he tells TIME, adding that the smaller and more localized the unrest is, the easier it is for the regime to contain it, and resist demands for change. “It’s a terrible setback for our democracy.”

Have you spent any time in the past 22 months worrying, in an existential way, about whether President Trump tried to scuttle a federal investigation into Russian interference at the core of America’s political process? Fear not. On Thursday, Attorney General William P. Barr explained that there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for any acts that appeared “obstructive”: The president was emotional.

Donald Trump “was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,” Barr announced at the news conference on Thursday. “Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.”

One might have argued that frustration and anger actually do sound like corrupt motives, but Barr presented them as excuses: The president was not obstructing, and if he was obstructing it was due to some sincere feelings, so let’s give him a mulligan, okay?

Throughout the 448-page Mueller report, the president is very emotional. He is forever “becoming angry” or “expressing anger” or “expressing frustration.” He “was furious” at Jeff Sessions for not protecting him. He “screamed” at and “lambasted” his attorney general, demanding, “How could you let this happen?” Regarding perceived “horrible treatment” of an adviser, the president was “upset for weeks.”

At one point, the president became so “unhappy” and “upset” with then-national security adviser Michael Flynn that “he would not look at him during intelligence briefings.”

I see almost no benefit in imagining parallel universes. Hypotheticals are difficult and not always comparable. But, my God: Can you imagine if a female president became so paralyzed by her emotions that she was notably upset for weeks? Can you imagine if a female politician’s strategy for dealing with her staff involved screaming at them, then lambasting them in public, and then not looking at them?

Can you imagine how hard she would have tried not to put herself in that situation, knowing how eager people have been throughout our political history to hold women’s emotions against them? Anti-suffragists claimed women’s rash temperament should exclude them from voting. Stubborn voters claimed women’s rash temperament should exclude them from running for office (Hillary Clinton spoke of learning to “control her emotions” as far back as college). In a Georgetown University study released just this week, 13 percent of Americans still believed that women were less emotionally suited to political office than men.

[Who cares whether you think these women are likable. They’re in power now.]

Can you imagine if the president was a person of color? If an attorney general waved away a black man’s bombastic behavior in the Oval Office by explaining he was often just really angry?

The president was emotional, and this isn’t exactly news. President Trump’s most consistent character trait is his tendency toward knee-jerk reactions to the situations and people surrounding him. In many ways, the behavior described in the Mueller report is an understandable version of this tendency: Who among us wouldn’t be ticked off to see our legacies tarnished via a drawn-out investigation?

Here is why it matters now, though. The attorney general of the United States of America has stated that the president’s emotions are relevant to the legal analysis of the obstruction case. And there’s a way we tend to talk about the emotional displays of men in power: as if they’re extremely relevant. Righteous, even. Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s outraged, tearful outbursts during his confirmation hearings last summer could have been taken as a sign that he lacked the dispassionate mien one would hope for in a Supreme Court nominee. But instead of putting a damper on the judge’s outraged approach, committee member Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) mirrored it, shouting and literally shaking a finger at his Democratic colleagues. His anger was rewarded. “Lindsey Graham may have single-handedly saved Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation,” read a CNN headline.

As much as Barr’s statements about President Trump are about the specifics of the Russia investigation, they also reflect broader questions: Whose emotions are valid? Whose anger is righteous, and whose anger is hysterical? Whose frustration is “sincere,” and whose is a sign that they are unfit to serve?

The answer isn’t for female politicians to start screaming, or male politicians to become robots. It’s to recognize that we can’t dignify emotion in one sex and dismiss it in another. It can’t be righteous indignation for some people, and hysterics for others. The president is an emotional man. What a luxury. So many of the rest of us are forced to just be crazy women.

The Emergence of Shuga Cain… at last!

Liam Campbell Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 19

Before the start of every Drag Race series I watch each of the 'Meet the Queens' videos and choose my instant favourites. Sometimes my picks do well and sometimes I get them horribly wrong. In S8 my pick was Thorgy Thor (good choice), in S9 it was Charlie Hides (how was I to know?), in S10 it was Monet X Change (she did me proud), and in S11 it was Shuga Cain. Although these picks are based merely on first impressions, I always stand by them and defend them even when things go horribly wrong (hey Charlie). I’ve also stood by Shuga, waiting to see if my early faith in her would pay off. Seven episodes came and went and I was still waiting.

Shuga for the Orange Runway

I am not sure that it’s Shuga fault. No where else In the history of Drag Race has any queen gotten such little air time. The closest example I can think of is Kandy Ho, who in S7 was almost invisible, but at least we got to see her lipsync a few times, and do it damn well too. With Shuga you have squint hard and really bloody concentrate to know that she’s there at all. But when you do examine her, you see that she’s been doing a solid job. Remember her Trump-themed orange runway look? Genius! So why haven't we been seeing her? Did she piss off a producer? Does Ru just not like her for some reason?

When this years long-awaited Snatch Game episode aired, Shuga was as usual invisible, at least for the first half of the episode. The at last, after eight episodes, once the Snatch Game began we finally saw the emergence of Shuga Cain. As a performance, her Charo was the best full transformation of anyone up there (the winner Silky was really just being Silky, and so was the other top Nina West), and her runway was absolutely the most stunning (I’m so glad Ru singled her out for a bit of direct praise). Perhaps the problem though, what kept her from winning the challenge, was that it was all a bit too studied, too perfect,and not quite enough fun. Shuga could do with loosening up a bit, with being a little less corporate, to succeed. I’m absolutely sure she can do it, but someone needs to tell her first. I'm not sure that's going to happen.

Shuga's Snatch Game episode runway look

I hope this week's Snatch Game episode performance will be the start of a spotlight for Shuga, but I’m afraid the producers will send her back to the background. And maybe straight out the door. S11 has been one of the most predictable (boring) seasons ever and everyone is talking about an end to Drag Race looming. The best thing the show can do is to go back to its roots when the programme was a competition more than just a reality TV show. We’d definitely be seeing more of Shuga if the focus was on talent and versatility. But instead the show just wants to focus on fighting and fucking (that's Yvie and Silky, and Vanjie and Brooke, respectively). Are they our top 4?

So come on Shuga, start shouting at everyone, get your claws out, have a torrid and camera-ready tryst, tell your sob story and get Ru to call her your new mommy. Then perhaps you can last another week. Or at least take that All Stars slot from Ra'jah O'Hara. Or just do you. We'll see you down the club and forget all about this god-damn TV show.

Jose Mourinho described Manchester United's defending as 'awful' for Lionel Messi's and Philippe Coutinho's goals in their Champions League humbling by Barcelona.

United suffered a 3-0 Champions League thrashing at Camp Nou to bow out of the competition at the quarter-final stage and end a second successive season trophyless.

Both Messi and Coutinho were allowed to move inside and curl efforts beyond the reach of United goalkeeper David de Gea either side of half-time in a 4-0 aggregate triumph.

Mourinho urged United to sign a central defender last summer but, despite interest in Milan Skriniar, Kalidou Koulibaly, Toby Alderweireld, Jerome Boateng, Harry Maguire and Diego Godin, United ended the window without a central defensive reinforcement. By the time of Mourinho's last game in charge at Liverpool on December 16, United had conceded more league goals than they had in the entirety of last season.

United have invested just £76.9million on three centre-backs since Sir Alex Ferguson retired, whereas Manchester City have spent £182.7m on that area and Liverpool £127.7m. Three of United's back four at Barcelona - Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Ashley Young - were signed by Ferguson.

"Lots of mistakes, lots of goals with awful defending on the inside foot," Mourinho told Russia Today. "You look to Coutinho goal, even to Messi goal."

While speaking specifically about the United match, Mourinho explained: "I think United's approach was different. I think in the first game they tried to occupy that central zone because Messi's position is easy to understand but is not easy to create a cage to control him. Because he comes from the right, then stays in the middle, and then [Ivan] Rakitic defends on the right and allows him to stay in the middle between the lines. It's very difficult.

"Manchester United in the first match, zonally, they occupied that central area very well. So when he came into the inside he was finding Fred, he was finding [Scott] McTominay coming to the inside all the time. In this match, maybe because Man United were losing 1-0, they tried to start the game with a different perspective.

"And then it was [Paul] Pogba wide on the left and McTominay much more on the right and Jesse Lingard playing as a number 10 behind the strikers. And in front of the defensive line was only Fred.

"And that's the area where Messi comes and gets the ball and when Messi has the ball. One, one, one. You are dead. That’s why I never liked individual man-on-man against Messi. Messi's a cage. You have to create a cage.

"Barcelona is Barcelona, they are a better team than Manchester United, they have better players than Manchester United. I think it’s normal they won."
Writing a generic type guard in Typescript, and what I learned from it

Introduction

I recently had a problem at work which stemmed from a function assuming its input is of one type, while in fact it sometimes could be of a different type.

My initial attempt to fix the problem was to determine what types the input could have, and to fix the function declaration so that the input's type is the union of all possible types, and to then use type guards within the function. Something like taking this function:

export function myFunc ( a : TypeA []): void { // ... }

and refactoring it into:

export function myFunc ( a : TypeA [] | TypeB []): void { if ( a . every ( e => e instanceof TypeA )) { // ... } else { // ... } }

This made me want to write a generic version of a type guard. Then using it in an array would be as simple as:

a instanceof Array && a.every(typeGuard<T>) .

But what is this typeGuard<T> ? Well, I already wrote a type guard for some TypeA in the example above, so a generic type guard could simply wrap a call to instanceof . We will see a less trivial implementation later. For now, we have:

export function typeGuard < T > ( o : any ): o is T { return o instanceof T ; }

This gives us an error, however: 'T' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.

The issue here is that the type T is not always available at runtime, since it could be an interface - a construct that is not accessible to the underlying JavaScript. This means that writing a generic type guard to discern between interfaces wouldn't have worked - though one could write non-generic type guards for specific interfaces. This does work for classes, however:

class myClass {} function classTypeGuard ( object : any ): boolean { return object instanceof myClass ; }

Even if we weren't trying to be generic over T , we would get the same error - the bit of code e instanceof TypeA above gives the same error about TypeA only referring to a type.

How, then, can we pass the function the type we want to check object is an instance of? For a class like myClass above, we would want to pass myClass itself to the function, like so:

function typeGuard ( o , className ) { return o instanceof className ; } const myClassObject = new myClass (); typeGuard ( myClassObject , myClass ); // returns true

Introducing the Constructor type signature

The above works, but we haven't specified any type restrictions on the className variable. A line like typeGuard(myClassObject, 5) raises no errors, but would cause a runtime TypeError: Right-hand side of 'instanceof' is not an object . We need to add a restriction on className 's type such that only objects that can be on the right side of instanceof can be used. This restriction stems from the definition of instanceof in JavaScript, where the object needs to be a constructor for some type. We can do this by specifying className 's type like so:

type Constructor < T > = { new (... args : any []): T }; function typeGuard < T > ( o , className : Constructor < T > ): o is T { return o instanceof className ; } const myClassObject = new myClass (); typeGuard ( myClassObject , myClass ); // returns true typeGuard ( myClassObject , 5 ); // Argument of type '5' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Constructor<{}>'

Let's unpack some of what we see here: we declare a new type - Constructor<T> is a type that has a method new that takes any number of arguments (including zero) and returns an instance of type T . This is exactly the restriction we need to be able to use className with instanceof .

Extending the type guard to work for primitive types

So far, all we've really done is wrap instanceof with another function, albeit with fancy-looking typing. We'd also like to be able to do something like this:

typeGuard ( 5 , 'number' ); // true typeGuard ( 'abc' , 'number' ); // false

What we need to do here is widen the type of the myClass parameter we're using, to something like this: type PrimitiveOrConstructor<T> = Constructor<T> | 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' .

Let's try and use this new type:

type PrimitiveOrConstructor < T > = | Constructor < T > | 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' ; function typeGuard < T > ( o , className : PrimitiveOrConstructor < T > ): o is T { if ( typeof className === 'string' ) { return typeof o === className ; } return o instanceof className ; } class A { a : string = 'a' ; } class B extends A { b : number = 3 ; } console . log ( typeGuard ( 5 , 'number' ), 'is true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( 5 , 'string' ), 'is false' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new A (), A ), 'is true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new A (), B ), 'is false' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), A ), 'is true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), B ), 'is true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), 'string' ), 'is false' );

Let's examine the new implementation of typeGuard: className is now either a Constructor<T> or it's a string whose value is limited to one of 'string' , 'number' , or 'boolean' . In case it's a string (technically, if its type is 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' ), then typeof className === 'string' will be true, and then the type guard will be based on typeof rather than instanceof . Notice that the if checks className 's type ('function' in the case of a Constructor<T> vs. 'string' in the rest of the cases), and the type guard itself is comparing type of the object we want to guard, with the actual value of className .

Something is still amiss, though. The return type for typeGuard is wrong in the case where we're checking if an object has a primitive type. Notice that typeGuard 's return type is o is T . this T comes from Constructor<T> if that's className 's type, but if it isn't then T is resolved as {} , meaning that for primitive types, our type guard is wrong:

function typeDependent ( o : any ) { if ( typeGuard ( o , 'number' )) { console . log ( o + 5 ); // Error: Operator '+' cannot be applied to types '{}' and '5' } }

We could correct this by letting the compiler know what T is manually, like so:

function typeDependent ( o : any ) { if ( typeGuard < number > ( o , 'number' )) { console . log ( o + 5 ); // o is number, no error } }

But we'd like for typeGuard 's return type to be inferred from the value of className . We need to use the type PrimitiveOrConstructor<T> to guard T | string | number | boolean . First, the type T should be inferred only if the type we're guarding isn't a primitive. We will make a new PrimitiveOrConstructor which is not generic, and then use that type to infer what type it is guarding.

type PrimitiveOrConstructor = | { new (... args : any []): any } | 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' ;

The type of object PrimitiveOrConstructor creates in the non-primitive case is not specified, because it can be inferred when resolving what type is being guarded by it:

type GuardedType < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > = T extends { new (... args : any []): infer U ; } ? U : T ;

Now, if the type we want to have a type guard for is aClass , then GuardedType<aClass> resolves to aClass . Otherwise, if we set T as 'string' then GuardedType<'string'> is just 'string' again, instead of the type string . We still need to be able to map from a string value like 'string' to the appropriate type, and to do this we will introduce keyof , and index types. First, we'll create a mapping from strings to types with a type map:

interface typeMap { // can also be a type string : string ; number : number ; boolean : boolean ; }

Now, we can use keyof typeMap to introduce the 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' in our PrimitiveOrConstructor , and index into typeMap to get the appropriate type for GuardedType in the primitive case:

type PrimitiveOrConstructor = | { new (... args : any []): any } | keyof typeMap ; type GuardedType < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > = T extends { new (... args : any []): infer U ; } ? U : T extends keyof typeMap ? typeMap [ T ] : never ;

A few things to note here:

keyof is a keyword that takes a type and returns a union of the names of properties of that type. In our case keyof typeMap is exactly what we need: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' . This is why the names of typeMap 's properties are the same as their types (i.e the string property has type string , and likewise for number and boolean ).

is a keyword that takes a type and returns a union of the names of properties of that type. In our case is exactly what we need: . This is why the names of 's properties are the same as their types (i.e the string property has type , and likewise for and ). GuardedType<T> now uses nested ternary if s: we first check if the type we're guarding has a constructor ( T is the type we're given that provides the constructor, U is the type actually created by that constructor - they could be the same), then we check if T is one of the primitive types, in which case we use it to index into our typeMap and go from 'string' to string .

now uses nested ternary s: we first check if the type we're guarding has a constructor ( is the type we're given that provides the constructor, is the type actually created by that constructor - they could be the same), then we check if is one of the primitive types, in which case we use it to index into our and go from to . If both of these conditions fail, the type never is used in the last branch because we will never get to it.

is used in the last branch because we will never get to it. It would have been simpler to avoid the second if altogether and do this:

type GuardedType < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > = T extends { new (... args : any []): infer U ; } ? U : typeMap [ T ];

But we get this error: Type 'T' cannot be used to index type 'typeMap'. In the case where T is not a constructor type, the compiler still doesn't narrow T down to keyof typeMap , and so tells us that we cannot safely use T as an index of typeMap . We will see this problem again later, it's an open issue that I feel is worth mentioning. I'll expand on it in an addendum.

Now that we've properly defined GuardedType for a given T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor , we can go back to our implementation of typeGuard :

function typeGuard < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > ( o , className : T ): o is GuardedType < T > { if ( typeof className === 'string' ) { return typeof o === className ; } return o instanceof className ; }

Our className parameter is now of type T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor , so GuardedType<T> resolves into the actual type we want to guard for - a class or a primitive type. We're still not done, though, because we get an error on that last line:

return o instanceof className ; // The right-hand side of an 'instanceof' expression must be of type 'any' or of a type assignable to the 'Function' interface type.

The issue here is similar to what happened when defining GuardedType . Here, className 's type is T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor throughout the function body, even though we would like it to narrow to 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' inside the if clause, and to new (...args: any[]) => any after it. Instead what we have to do is assign className to a local variable with type PrimitiveOrConstructor , and use that variable because its type will be narrowed by the compiler:

function typeGuard < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > ( o , className : T ): o is GuardedType < T > { // to allow for type narrowing, and therefore type guarding: const localPrimitiveOrConstructor : PrimitiveOrConstructor = className ; if ( typeof localPrimitiveOrConstructor === 'string' ) { return typeof o === localPrimitiveOrConstructor ; } return o instanceof localPrimitiveOrConstructor ; }

Putting it all together

Whew, that seemed like a lot to get through. Let's put it all together so we can discern the bigger picture:

interface typeMap { // for mapping from strings to types string : string ; number : number ; boolean : boolean ; } type PrimitiveOrConstructor = // 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | constructor | { new (... args : any []): any } | keyof typeMap ; // infer the guarded type from a specific case of PrimitiveOrConstructor type GuardedType < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > = T extends { new (... args : any []): infer U ; } ? U : T extends keyof typeMap ? typeMap [ T ] : never ; // finally, guard ALL the types! function typeGuard < T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor > ( o , className : T ): o is GuardedType < T > { const localPrimitiveOrConstructor : PrimitiveOrConstructor = className ; if ( typeof localPrimitiveOrConstructor === 'string' ) { return typeof o === localPrimitiveOrConstructor ; } return o instanceof localPrimitiveOrConstructor ; }

And to test it out, let's use the same examples as before, only now the type guarding will actually work and give us string , number , A or B as appropriate:

class A { a : string = 'a' ; } class B extends A { b : number = 5 ; } console . log ( typeGuard ( 5 , 'number' ), 'true' ); // typeGuard<"number">(o: any, className: "number"): o is number console . log ( typeGuard ( 5 , 'string' ), 'false' ); // typeGuard<"string">(o: any, className: "string"): o is string console . log ( typeGuard ( new A (), A ), 'true' ); // typeGuard<typeof A>(o: any, className: typeof A): o is A console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), A ), 'true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new A (), B ), 'false' ); // typeGuard<typeof B>(o: any, className: typeof B): o is B console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), B ), 'true' ); console . log ( typeGuard ( new B (), 'string' ), 'false' );

In summary

Having gone through all of the above, I realize that it would almost always be simpler to test for particular cases with instanceof , for interfaces with user-defined type guards, and for primitives with typeof .

I did learn a lot from trying to solve this problem myself, and especially from a StackOverflow answer by user jcalz . This article is mostly going through their answer and explaining the different parts of it. Going through the steps of this implementation involves understanding typescript's typing system, generics, type guards, useful keywords like keyof and infer , union types, and index types.

Addendum

When we used T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor in both GuardedType and typeGuard , we saw that conditions about T 's type (e.g extending a constructor vs. extending keyof typeMap ) didn't help the compiler narrow down T 's type, even though we defined PrimitiveOrConstructor to either be a constructor type or a valid property name of typeMap .

In the definition of GuardedType the else branch of checking for the case of a constructor type didn't let us index into typeMap , despite that being the only other option for T . In the implementation of the typeGuard function we tried to do the same in reverse order - we checked for typeof className === 'string' which covers the case of T extends keyof typeMap , but outside this clause T was not narrowed down to a constructor type.

For defining GuardedType , we had to explicitly write a second ternary if to let the compiler know that T extends keyof typeMap so we could resolve the type as typeMap[T] . For implementing typeGuard , we needed to assign className (with type T extends PrimitiveOrConstructor ) to a local variable with type PrimitiveOrConstructor . This variable's type narrowed as necessary to 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' inside the if clause, and to new (...args: any[]) => any after it.

An Indian man chopped off his index finger in desperation after voting for the wrong party in the country's national election.

In a video that has gone viral on social media, Pawan Kumar said he became confused by the symbols on the electronic voting machine and voted for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party instead of its regional rival in Uttar Pradesh state on Thursday.

Distraught, Kumar went home and chopped off his finger with a meat cleaver.

Even though votes are cast electronically at polling stations, the index finger of every voter is marked with indelible ink after they cast ballots, to make sure they do not vote again.

A second video showed the butcher's knife on the ground outside a toilet, with Kumar standing nearby holding up his hand with a bandage over the missing appendage.

“I wanted to vote for elephant but it went to flower,” he says in the video.

The lotus is the symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party while the Bahujan Samaj Party, part of an alliance fighting Modi in the northern state, uses the elephant. The party symbol is used on voting machines.

“I went home and chopped off my finger with the cleaver,” said Kumar. He said no pressure had been put on him over his vote.

Thursday was the second day of India's marathon election which started on April 11 and runs through to May 19.
Zr.Ms. Evertsen verzamelde inlichtingen in de Zwarte Zee

Door: Jaime Karremann

Bericht geplaatst: 19-04-2019 | Laatst aangepast: 19-04-2019



Zr.Ms. Evertsen voer deze week aan het hoofd van het permanente NAVO-eskader SNMG2 in de Zwarte Zee. Marineschepen.nl was de afgelopen dagen aan boord en zag hoe de Russische vloot en luchtmacht de NAVO-schepen bijna voortdurend in de gaten hield, en andersom. De commandant van SNMG2, commandeur Boudewijn Boots: "We moeten ons realiseren dat het werk dat we nu doen, het dichtst komt bij werk waarom een marine er is. Dit is het dichtst bij echt... warfare."

Op de brug van Zr.Ms. Evertsen wordt door de uitkijken de lucht al afgezocht met verrekijkers, als een stem vanuit de commandocentrale door een kleine luidspreker klinkt: "Twee Flankers, peiling noord, op een afstand van 10 mijl, hoogte 2.000 voet, inbound!"1







Kort daarop een nieuwe melding: "De drie Fencers hebben feet wet en zijn eveneens inbound, peiling 010. De fighters in de peiling 080 houden een CAP-station, daar gaat geen dreiging van uit." Aan de hand van de peilkompassen turen de uitkijken over de stapelwolken in de opgegeven richting van de inkomende Flankers, gevechtsvliegtuigen. Er is nog niets te zien.



Even later weer de stem uit de commandocentrale, waar een heel team zit om het beeld om het eskader heen op te bouwen: "Time on top 1 minuut."

De spanning op de brug neemt toe. Nog één minuut en dan vliegen ze over ons schip. Waarom zien we ze nog niet? Inmiddels is er ook iemand uit de centrale gearriveerd met een camera en een enorme telelens.

"Time on top... 30 seconden."



Natuurlijk, de radars hebben de toestellen al lange tijd in de gaten, maar de commandocentrale verwacht van de brug wel dat de vliegtuigen visueel worden geïdentificeerd. Wat is het nummer, hangt er wat onder de vleugels?



"Visueel!" zegt een van de uitkijken en wijst naar stipjes die uit de wolken in de richting van het schip vliegen.

Het klinkt als een oefening uit de Koude Oorlog, maar dit is echt en dit is nu, op een doodgewone dinsdagochtend. Een air event. Ja, de Evertsen vaart in internationale wateren en niemand heeft intenties om geweld te gebruiken. Toch is de lucht waar de uitijken op de brug van Zr.Ms. Evertsen in kijken Russisch luchtruim boven de Krim, het door Rusland geannexeerde schiereiland.







De Evertsen vaart met een paar zeemijl per uur, vergezeld door het Bulgaarse fregat Drazki, het Roemeense fregat Regele Ferdinand (Type 22), het Canadese fregat HMCS Toronto (Halifaxklasse) en het Turkse fregat TCG Yildirim (Barbarosklasse) net ten zuiden van de Krim. Om het verband heen zijn de Russische eenheden volop aanwezig.

De straalmotoren van het eerste paar gevechtsvliegtuigen zijn inmiddels te horen en even later vliegen twee Flankers op hoogte langs de Evertsen. Ook de Fencers vliegen over het verband, cirkelen om de schepen en vliegen uit en dan weer in. Regelmatig komen nieuwe meldingen vanuit de centrale binnen, van halverwege de ochtend tot halverwege de middag blijven Russische vliegtuigen actief rond het verband. Met enige regelmaat komen ze dichterbij, maar steeds blijven ze op professionele afstand en hoogte.

Ook vanaf zee is er ruime aandacht voor het NAVO-eskader. Al sinds het verband de Zwarte Zee in voer, wordt het vergezeld door het nieuwe Russische inlichtingenschip Ivan Kurs. Ook de Ivan Kurs blijft voortdurend op gepaste afstand. Het eskader doet geen moeite om het luisterend oor van zich af te schudden. Als de NAVO-schepen wat vaart aanzetten, heeft de Rus moeite om ze bij te houden, maar sluit later weer aan.



Behalve de trouwe metgezel is er vandaag veel meer activiteit rond het verband te zien. En steeds als er weer een nieuw schip aan de horizon uit de nevel opdoemt, zetten de jongens en meiden op de brug hun verrekijker tegen het raam en proberen ze de visuele puzzel zo snel mogelijk op te lossen. Klein of groot schip, hoeveel masten, kanon, lanceerinstallaties? Al snel worden de namen van Russische scheepsklassen genoemd, wordt er gebladerd in klappers en is er overleg met de commandocentrale. Langzaamaan verschijnen steeds meer Russische marineschepen aan de horizon. Sommige varen mee, andere lijken zich met andere zaken bezig te houden.







Als de schepen zijn herkend en de vliegtuigen even niet in de buurt zijn, is het op de brug weer business as usual. Het brugteam, bestaande uit een officier van de wacht, twee uitkijken en een seiner, lijkt snel gewend. Als een uitkijk wordt afgelost, worden de contacten doorgegeven alsof het fregat op de Noordzee vaart. "Boorplatform, windmolenpark, vissertje, koopvaarder," is nu (met dezelfde monotone stem, wijzend naar de schepen in de verte): "Tarantul op rood 80, dat is een Nanuchka, daar Krivak mod II, Kashin daar en er schijnt ook nog een Kilo [onderzeeboot] ergens te zijn."



Zeker verder naar beneden en naar achteren in het schip gaat het dagelijks leven gewoon door. Er wordt hard gewerkt om de 220 mannen en vrouwen aan boord van goed eten te voorzien, aan de kruisvaartdiesels wordt gesleuteld, de brandoefeningen worden gedaan, er wordt gesport (zowel fysiek als digitaal).

Eskader

Tegen het einde van de middag is het moment aangebroken dat het verband koers zet naar het zuiden. De marineschepen van landen die geen haven in de Zwarte Zee hebben, moeten het zeegebied (volgens een stokoud verdrag) gaan verlaten. Na een manoeuvreeroefening is het tijd om afscheid te nemen, middels een sailpast. Het Roemeense en Bulgaarse schip gaan naar hun thuishavens, de drie overgebleven schepen gaan richting de Bosporus.



Als de avond is gevallen en de Evertsen midden op de Zwarte Zee rustig naar het zuiden koerst, kleuren televisies in de verblijven groen. Als in een klein dorp schuiven de voetballiefhebbers voor de verschillende tv's aan boord voor de kwartfinale van de Champions League, Juventus - Ajax. Het gewone leven gaat ook op een marineschip soms gewoon door.

Commandeur Boudewijn Boots heeft de leiding over SNMG2. Boots heeft ook de leiding over zes NAVO-schepen die de EU-Turkije deal monitoren in de Egeïsche Zee, zodat migranten niet meer met bootjes de oversteek van Turkije naar Griekenland maken. Daar vaart altijd een groot marineschip, met een kolonel als ondercommandant van Boots. "Zij zitten continu in de complexe Egeïsche omgeving, waar die migratiekwestie voortdurend speelt."

Motiverend

Een van de taken van het NAVO-eskader, en dus Zr.Ms. Evertsen, is duidelijk: het verzamelen van inlichtingen over de Russische krijgsmacht. Dat werk wordt overigens niet op de brug gedaan, maar elders aan boord, in de commandocentrale. Waar men de beschikking heeft over vele sensoren, de uitkijken zijn uiteraard slechts een onderdeel. Een belangrijk middel is de ontvangst en verwerking van Russische radarsignalen.



Commandant van het eskader, SNMG2, is commandeur Boudewijn Boots, samen met zijn internationale staf is hij sinds januari ingescheept aan boord van Zr.Ms. Evertsen en in de zes maanden daarvoor aan boord van Zr.Ms. De Ruyter.

In de kajuit, waar we elkaar in januari een paar minuten voor vertrek uit Den Helder elkaar spraken, spreek ik hem weer. Nu over de Zwarte Zee.



Volgens commandeur Boots is de Russische reactie op de aanwezigheid van het eskader niet anders dan verwacht. "Dit lijkt op vorig jaar toen we met de De Ruyter hier waren. Ze doen dat, in mijn optiek, om te laten zien dat ze ons gezien hebben, laten zien wat ze kunnen, laten zien dat ze er zijn. Ik moet zeggen, niet bedreigend. We weten ook van hun vliegpatronen en oefengebieden in de Zwarte Zee."



De Russische acties en de activiteiten van SNMG2 worden in de Russische pers uitgebreid besproken, volgens Boots. "In de pers staat dat de NAVO aan een halsband door de Zwarte Zee wordt geleid en ons er dan weer uit laten. Een bepaalde manier van uitleg, maar dat is aan hen."



Voor de bemanning van de Evertsen werken de acties van de Russen soms juist motiverend, erkent Boots. "Dan heb je minder moeite met uitleggen hoe serieus het werk is dat we doen."

WiFi

De Russische krijgsmacht was niet alleen fysiek aanwezig rond het NAVO-verband, ook op gebied van cyber. Vrijwel de gehele periode in de Zwarte Zee was het internetverkeer aan boord (zowel WiFi als 4G) van het schip aan banden gelegd of helemaal verboden was. Boots: "Het kan zijn dat je valse mobiele netwerken ontvangt, waardoor degene die zo'n netwerk heeft opgezet verbinding kan maken met de toestellen van bemanningsleden. Om hen daartegen te beschermen treffen we maatregelen, die we in het verleden niet kenden. Zodra we in de buurt zijn van niet-NAVO eenheden die zo'n netwerk op kunnen zetten, schakelen we onze WiFi aan boord uit."

Diplomatie

Behalve voor het verzamelen van inlichtingen, is het verband in deze wateren ter geruststelling van bondgenoten in het Zwarte Zee-gebied en afschrikking van Rusland. Dat vereist van de NAVO en zeker van de commandant van SNMG2 heel voorzichtig manoeuvreren.



Boots: "Zo'n Zwarte Zee-periode ligt echt gevoelig. Zeker door de twee provincies in Georgië die in andere handen zijn gevallen, de annexatie van de Krim en de inbeslagname van twee Oekraïense marineschepen die door de Straat van Kerch voeren. Dat is echt boven het maritiem-tactische niveau. Maar je bent als SNMG2 wel een schaakstuk van de NAVO."



"Georgië maakt zich zorgen om hun veiligheid. Ze zetten daarom flink in op de publiciteit rond ons bezoek aan Poti. Uit de gesprekken met de hoogwaardigheidsbekleders, waaronder de aartsbisschop, blijkt dan waar ze mee zitten en ook de onvermijdelijke vraag van wanneer kunnen we lid worden van de NAVO, een vraag die ik onmiddellijk pareer want daar kan ik geen antwoord op geven," zegt Boots.

"Maar ook de NAVO-landen aan de Zwarte Zee hebben zorgen. Die zien ontwikkelingen hier waar ze niet blij van worden. De acties van de Russen, de enorme militaire opbouw van hun verdediging en de activiteiten die ze daarmee uitvoeren. Daar word je niet geruster op. Dan zie je ook het belang van dit soort oefeningen. We hebben net de oefeningen Sea Shield gedaan, voor de vijfde keer werd die oefening georganiseerd. Die wordt ieder jaar niet alleen maritiem tactisch, maar ook strategisch van grotere waarden. In de Russische media wordt deze oefening aanzienlijk zwaarder aangezet dan vorig jaar. Dat hebben we ook aan het aantal vliegtuigen dat live door onze oefening heen kwam vliegen."



Door de samenwerking met andere marines dan die in de regio, willen deze landen hun kennis en vaardigheden op een hoger plan brengen. Zo heeft de Evertsen een boardingteam van de Georgische strijdkrachten een training gegeven en hebben Bulgarije en Roemenië ieder een eigen fregat laten aansluiten bij SNMG2. Die twee schepen, de Drazki en de Regele Ferdinand, zijn echter op leeftijd. De Drazki is een klein en oud Belgisch fregat, de Regele Ferdinand een oud Brits Type 22 fregat. Beide schepen zijn enorm verouderd en Roemenië is daarom op zoek naar nieuwe schepen.



Damen en Naval Group zijn in Roemenië in een verbeten strijd verwikkeld om nieuwe Roemeense korvetten. Tijdens het bezoek aan Constanta, Roemenië, bracht de Roemeense president een bezoek aan de Evertsen en heeft de bemanning over de kwaliteiten van het Nederlandse product verteld.

Oorlogvoering

Na een nacht varen verschijnt woensdagochtend het begin van de poort naar de Middellandse Zee in beeld, in de vorm van de recent gebouwde Derde Bosporusbrug. De Evertsen maakt zich op voor een lang weekend Istanbul, dat overigens wordt aangevangen met een receptie aan boord, in het hart van de oude stad.



Voor het zover is wil Boots nog wat toevoegen aan het interview. "Een reis als deze is wat we vroeger normaal vonden, maar nu iets minder omdat we natuurlijk een hele periode met vredesmissies hebben gehad. We moeten ons realiseren dat het werk dat we nu doen, het dichtst komt bij werk waarom een marine er is. Dit is het dichtst bij echt... warfare. Ik ben de eerste die hoopt op een ommezwaai en dat het er nooit van komt, maar je kan er beter maar klaar voor zijn. Daar zijn dit soort reizen belangrijk voor."

Poor Cleric. Dude just wants to play properly. If only the rest of the Heroes understood the beauty of RULES-AS-WRITTEN.

Of course, today’s comic goes a little beyond the rule of cool moments that make for memorable gaming. Deciding to allow a cool stunt even though it’s physically impossible is every GM’s right. I mean… did you guys ever seen the flying tank scene in the A-Team movie? Yes it’s stupid. And yes, I want to play in that game.

I’m sure we can come up with any number of examples. We’re talking about jumping with Fighter across the Grand Canyon or (even more absurdly) to the moon. We’re talking about seducing the dragon or going full Bearinton. This sort of of absurdity can be found in negotiating for magic items at a copper each, or using your acrobatics to phase through a solid wall, or telling such a compelling lie that the other PCs forget you ever existed. You may scoff, but I don’t think these are necessarily “bad actions” just because they’re silly. I’m an Exalted player, so I know that any of these goofy situations can and should be possible in the right kind of campaign. What’s more insidious is the belief that, because of XYZ result on the die, a chosen version of reality ought to spring into existence.

These games we play are a constant negotiation. Players propose, dice inform, and GMs decide. When you stray too far from that formula, you risk a return to the little kid realm of cops and robbers.

“I shot you!”

“No you didn’t!”

“Yes I did!”

When you mistake a natural 20 for “I do the thing,” you’re not just messing with the rules. You’re not just messing with the integrity of the fiction. You’re messing with the fundamental premise of cooperative RPG play. In effect you’re saying that, “My version of the game world is the only one that matters.”

So sure, if your group wants to put a little extra stank on Nat 20s and give them special results, that’s fine by me. I even think it can be fun if you handle it with finesse. Just don’t expect a die roll to be the last word what really happens in-game. As Fighter is about to find out, that’s how you wind up boarding the d10 hit die express elevator.

Question of the day then! Have you ever encountered the phenomenon of “I rolled a 20 so [insert goofy thing here] happens?” What was the situation? Did the player ultimately succeed, or were they in for a reality check? Tell us your tale down in the comments!

ADD SOME NSFW TO YOUR FANTASY! If you’ve ever been curious about that Handbook of Erotic Fantasy banner down at the bottom of the page, then you should check out the “Quest Giver” reward level over on The Handbook of Heroes Patreon. Twice a month you’ll get to see what the Handbook cast get up to when the lights go out. Adults only, 18+ years of age, etc. etc.
Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr had taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest during his panel’s probe — but also corresponded with the White House. | Win McNamee/Getty Images mueller investigation Mueller report ropes in Senate GOP Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr apparently supplied the White House counsel’s office with information about the Russia probe.

The Senate GOP found itself ensnared in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report Thursday, with new revelations about Sen. Richard Burr's communications with the White House and details about a GOP aide’s quest to obtain Hillary Clinton‘s emails.

Though the vast majority of the report centered on Russian influence in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump’s apparent efforts to undercut Mueller’s probe, the report also offers a window into how the broad investigations have touched on individual senators and even a relatively unknown congressional staffer. It also shows how eager the White House was for insight into the series of federal probes that were launched early in Trump’s presidency.

Story Continued Below

Senate Intelligence Chairman Burr (R-N.C.), for instance, apparently supplied the White House counsel's office with information about FBI investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to the report. The report says that on March 9, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey briefed congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference. That briefing included "an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation."

Burr then corresponded with the White House a week later about the Russia probes, and the White House counsel's office, led by Don McGahn, "appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation," the special counsel report said.

Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Burr, said that the senator “does not recall this specific conversation with Mr. McGahn in March of 2017; however, any conversations between the two would have been in reference to the need for White House personnel to voluntarily comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation.”

The Senate Intelligence probe has been widely viewed on Capitol Hill as more productive than its corresponding House investigation. There's been far less infighting and Burr has taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest, including skipping meetings with Trump while he's been overseeing investigations. Former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), now the committee's ranking member, was seen by Democrats as far more partisan than Burr in his probes.

“If specific individuals were discussed, they would have been those known to the committee, the White House, and the media. The Chairman’s stewardship over the Committee’s bipartisan and fact-based investigation over the last two years speaks for itself,” Carroll said.

But Burr communicating with Trump's aides about the FBI probe could undercut some of those warm bipartisan feelings. The Senate Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Mark Warner (D-Va.), did not respond to a request for comment but Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the panel, made an indirect reference to Burr in a statement on Thursday.

"Given evidence from the Mueller report, the committee must take steps to ensure its investigations do not leak to the executive branch," he said.

On March 16, 2017, the White House counsel's office was briefed by Burr on "4-5 targets" of the Russia probe, according to notes taken by McGahn's chief of staff, Annie Donaldson.

Those targets were identified as former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, campaign aide Carter Page and "Greek Guy" George Papadopoulos, who was charged with lying to the FBI, according to Donaldson's notes. Those notes say Burr said Manafort was under investigation for Ukraine and Russia dealings — not his work for the Trump campaign — and that Page was being targeted for the "$ game."

McGahn and Donaldson said that they believed those people were being investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the special counsel's office was skeptical.

The committee "does not formally investigate individuals as 'targets'; the notes on their face reference the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Comey; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the FBI for Comey's briefing to the Gang of 8 [congressional leaders] on March 9," the Mueller report reads.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also found himself mentioned briefly in the report, though there was no reference his 2016 meeting with intelligence officials, in which former Vice President Joe Biden alleged the Kentucky Republican declined to join a bipartisan statement on Russian hacking.

Instead, the GOP leader made a cameo amid Mueller’s inquiry on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

McConnell spoke to McGahn about Sessions, according to the report: "McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to avert Sessions's recusal by speaking to Sessions's personal counsel, Sessions's chief of staff, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times."

Sessions' decision to recuse himself prompted Trump to call for his resignation. But his then-chief of staff Reince Priebus warned against the move, arguing that the administration would not be able to get a new attorney general confirmed "and that the Department of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President." Trump responded he could make a recess appointment. But that would have been untenable, since pro forma sessions now block recess appointments.

The report also offered new information about the work of a GOP Senate aide to obtain Clinton’s deleted emails during the 2016 election.

Barbara Ledeen, a Senate Judiciary Committee aide, apparently communicated with Peter Smith, an investment advisor, who was also interested in finding Clinton’s emails.

In a December 2015 exchange cited in the report, Ledeen wrote to Smith about an unnamed individual who could obtain the Clinton emails “which 1. Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies.” She added “that would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.” Ledeen attached a proposal in the e-mail that suggested Chinese, Russian and Iranian intelligence services could put together the content on Clinton’s email server. Smith declined to participate in Ledeen’s plan, the report said.

Both were later contacted by former Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn, who had been directed by Trump to find the Clinton emails.

Ledeen and Smith reconnected in 2016, and according to the Mueller report, Ledeen said that she obtained what appeared to be Clinton’s deleted emails via the dark web. But a tech advisor to Erik Prince, a businessman and Trump campaign supporter, found that the emails were not real.

A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the former Judiciary chairman, said that Ledeen’s activities were “unrelated to the Judiciary Committee’s oversight work and she was never a member of the oversight team.

“Ledeen’s inquiry was not authorized by the Judiciary Committee. In fact the committee staff didn’t learn of her involvement until after it had been completed. She was instructed not to do any further follow-up once the committee learned of her involvement,” said the spokesman.

Ledeen remains an aide on the committee.
A wall of oyster shells has been erected near Montegut to protect historical Native American mounds threatened by erosion and sea level rise.

The partially-submerged wall was completed this month by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL), Pointe-au-Chien Indian Tribe and more than 100 volunteers. They spent weeks hauling and placing about 200 tons of shells gathered from New Orleans-area restaurants.

The wall will act as an artificial reef, fostering the growth of oysters and other marine life while protecting a collection of mounds valued by members of the tribe.

Oyster shell recycling program starts for New Orleans area restaurants A year after the Shell Oil Company donated $1 million to start an oyster shell recycling program, the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana officially has launched its program collecting shells from metro New Orleans area restaurants and returning them to Louisiana...

“Our ancestors made these mounds, so we won’t just stand by while they are washed away,” Pointe-au-Chien member Donald Dardar said.

"We like that the oyster bed will be good for other fish, too, since we're mostly commercial fishermen here,” added Theresa Dardar, Donald’s wife.

The oyster reef is the second built by CRCL in Louisiana. In 2016, the organization finished a half-mile-long reef in St. Bernard Parish using more than 4,000 tons of recycled shells.

CRCL Executive Director Kimberly Reyher said the reefs acts as “speed bumps” against storms, slowing them down before they strike coastal communities and damage fragile marshlands.

Started in 2014, CRCL’s oyster shell recycling program prevents tons of shells from being dumped into landfills. Returning shells to the Gulf of Mexico’s waters fosters the growth of more oysters. Young oysters prefer to latch onto old shells to begin their final stages of development.
Luke Kelly was born in Sheriff Street, one of the best-known thoroughfares of Dublin’s north inner city, in November 1940. For decades the area’s workers had labored on the nearby docks — providing the backbone, thirty years before, for much of Jim Larkin’s organizing efforts. But by the mid-twentieth century, those employment opportunities had begun to decline and living conditions were often poor. Luke was born into a one-room cottage on Lattimore Place with communal toilet and taps shared among eight families. But his father, another Luke Kelly, was one of few at the time who managed to get a well-paying job, working in another bastion of Dublin labor at the Jacob’s Biscuit Factory. When Dublin Corporation finally got around to demolishing the Lattimore cottages in 1942, the Kellys became the first family to move into the new St. Laurence O’Toole’s flats, a place which provided the basis for a childhood Luke junior remembered fondly. As Pete St. John memorialized in The Rare Ould Times, working-class Dublin in the early 1940s was a city of songs and stories, and “haunting children’s rhymes,” a place where lyricism pervaded daily life. In the absence of radios in most houses, this tradition was carried down in sing-songs, often taking place in nearby houses after pub closures. Although Irish rebel tunes were always part of the repertoire, Luke’s father’s specialties were American. As his brother, Paddy Kelly, remembered, “he had this talent, our father, to sing negro spirituals by people like Paul Robeson, we used to sit around and join in — that was our entertainment.” For many in Dublin’s inner city at that time, Des Geraghty remembers in his excellent memoir of Luke Kelly, traditional Irish music was somewhat alien, more a “culchie endeavor” than anything that resonated with urban life. The narrow cultural nationalism which had been espoused by the conservative victors of Ireland’s revolutionary period arguably reached its height in the 1940s, with Taoiseach Éamon de Valera making his famous “Ireland That We Dreamed Of” speech. His narrative of “a land whose countryside would be bright with cozy homesteads” seemed to have little room for aspirations of the working-class. The ‘moral’ Ireland of de Valera’s imagination—Gaelic, Catholic, “living the life that God desired”—had never had much interest in improving the lot of the country’s workers, although they usually paid the cost of attempts to beat the population into its confines. As Luke Kelly grew up and left school at 13, his cultural tastes increasingly kicked against this current. Although he regularly attended Irish céilí dances with his sister Mona, the music he listened to owed more to the sounds of urban America his father had introduced him to — Fats Domino, Al Jolson, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como. He also developed an interest in theater and musicals. A fire forced the family to up sticks to the suburb of Whitehall in 1953, a move that Luke Kelly never adapted to, but despite the requirement to take the bus every day, he travelled regularly to the Marian Arts Society in Dublin’s inner city where he was actively involved in the plays it put on in the Oriel Hall. His teenage years were to be less happy, however, than his childhood and a restless Kelly soon set his sights on leaving Ireland. In 1957, after a number of frustrating attempts to find decent work, the 17-year-old Kelly followed his brother Paddy to Britain.

Revelation Arriving in Britain in the late 1950s, Luke Kelly could hardly have imagined how his time in the country would transform his life—and bring him closer to Irish culture. Although London later became the destination of preference for Irish emigrants, at the time Luke ventured across the Irish Sea the Midlands were a safer bet for work. It was there, in Wolverhampton, that Paddy Kelly performed the duty of many Irish older brothers of years past and since in fixing Luke up with a job and a place to stay. But Luke’s time as a steel fixer on that building site would prove short. After being told by a colleague onsite that others were being paid more for the same work, Luke confronted the foreman to demand a raise. In an incident that his brother Paddy described as naive, but which gave indication of Luke’s budding politics, he was swiftly sacked—and only narrowly avoided having the entire Irish contingent join him. Luke went on to live an itinerant life for a number of years in cities across the north of England. Describing himself as a sort of “beatnik,” a member of an anti-conformist youth subculture given expression in the writing of Jack Kerouac, he worked a wide range of jobs. He would later characterize his life during this period as “cleaning lavatories, cleaning windows, cleaning railways, buy very rarely cleaning my face.” But these years on the road would prove fruitful, with a number of encounters profoundly shaping the Luke Kelly story. The first, in Newcastle in early 1960, would lead him back to Irish music. On an evening he intended to visit a local jazz club, Luke Kelly instead found himself drawn to singing he heard coming from a folk night. There he found a crowd of Geordies reciting The Auld Triangle, the centerpiece of Brendan Behan’s play The Quare Fellow. He recounted years later the pride and enthusiasm he felt hearing a song rooted in the working-class Dublin he grew up in sung with such passion by an English crowd. He began to feel that maybe there was more to Irish music than he had believed during his time at home. The next formative encounter was during his time in Birmingham, when Luke Kelly befriended and then became house guest of Sean and Mollie Mulready. The Mulreadys were active Communists who had been forced to leave Ireland under a cloud after persecution from the Church and state. It was in this company Luke was introduced for the first time to the ideas of Marxism and came to join the Young Communist League and the Connolly Association, an Irish emigrant group linked to the Communist Party in Britain. After his wilderness years, the Mulreadys provided Luke with a solid base—helping him to, in their words, “clean up and find a job.” He also applied himself to night school where he studied literature and left-wing politics under the Mulreadys and also Marxist classicist George Thompson. Luke would later say that “my interest in folk music grew parallel to my politics,” having met the Mulreadys first through his membership of the socialist Clarion Singers Club, and then in turn coming to learn the banjo while living in their house. In this earliest phase of his musical development, he saw his socialism and his growing love for folk music to be inextricably linked. “The music of the left-wing,” he thought, “was romantic and rejuvenating.” As his talent grew Luke took to spending his weekend touring Irish pubs with the Connolly Association selling its newspaper The Irish Democrat. As one of its leading members Sean Redmond would recall to Des Geraghty, “the drill was quite simple. He would go up to the stage or music stand, sing a few songs, then announce that he was here selling the Connolly Association’s newspaper and he expected everyone to buy one.” But by 1962 the paths of politics and music were beginning to diverge. Seeing great potential in his intellect and application, George Thompson arranged for Luke Kelly to go to university in Prague to further his political development. Availing of this opportunity would almost certainly have meant giving up his musical career—so a choice had to be made. Although still committed to socialist politics, Luke had by this time caught the folk music bug. He turned down the chance to study in Prague and packed his bags for a trip elsewhere, returning to his native Dublin as it was beginning to sway with the winds of the 1960s.

Transformation Luke Kelly’s growing interest in folk music reflected an international movement known as the ‘Ballad Boom,’ which influenced the Anglophone world from the late 1950s. In America it was associated with singers like Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, in Britain with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, each run through with radical political themes from opposition to war and nuclear weapons to support for civil rights struggles and the labor movement. But in Ireland the influence of this ballad boom was arguably even more significant as the country emerged from decades of cultural repression at the hands of the Catholic Church and reactionary politicians. Despite achieving independence for the southern 26 counties, Ireland’s revolutionary period from 1916 to 1923 had ended with a crushing defeat for those aiming at more fundamental social change. The socialists, feminists and radical republicans who had fought for national liberation found instead a country of Red Scares, Church-led anti-jazz campaigns and enduring deprivation. The decades afterwards had seen precious few opportunities for left-wing politics in Ireland. In the 1960s, for the first time, the social context seemed to be thawing out. As Luke Kelly remarked, “There’s a new spirit among young people, a social and political awareness that I think is directly related to the ballads… I think things are going to happen in Ireland again.” From an ever-growing array of sessions in city pubs to the massive popularity of the Fleadh Cheoil music festival, it seemed as though free cultural expression was beginning to stir. Folk music was particularly well-suited to provide the conduit for this development. Many of its forums offered the opportunity for people to bring their own guitars, banjos, flutes or fiddles and join in, and for those who couldn’t play instruments there was always the opportunity to sing. Those attending its gigs were encouraged to learn the songs—or bring their own—and participate in the production of the music. The song themes were quotidian, their spirit rebellious and irreverent, and the protagonists more often working people than kings or lords. It was, in short, a real popular culture. It was into this environment Luke Kelly emerged as one of the standout Irish folk performers of the early 1960s. In 1962 he was a founding member of the Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, alongside Ciarán Bourke, Barney McKenna and its most prominent member Ronnie Drew. Building a reputation for themselves on the Dublin pub scene, most prominently in O’Donoghues of Merrion Row, the group quickly became popular and arrived on national television by 1963. In 1964 they renamed themselves The Dubliners, allegedly inspired by Luke Kelly’s infatuation with the James Joyce book of the same title, and it was to stick with the group for more than fifty years. In 1964 The Dubliners released their first album with Transatlantic Records, then the premier folk label. A live album, Luke Kelly was its leading vocalist, singing songs like Wild Rover, Tramps and Hawkers and Home Boys Home which would become staples in the years to come. But the real triumph of the album was his rendition of The Rocky Road to Dublin, a song about Irish emigrants to Britain popularized in the mid-nineteenth century. Notoriously difficult to sing, Luke Kelly produced a masterclass which became the song’s definitive recording. Barney McKenna was later to remark that Kelly was the only singer he’d ever heard to sing the song to the rhythm it was played on the fiddle. But Luke Kelly remained unsatisfied by his development as a musician. Traveling back and forth to Britain during this early success for The Dubliners, he set his mind on a musical apprenticeship under the guidance of the man many considered to be the godfather of folk at the time, Ewan MacColl.

Evolution Ewan MacColl had been born in Salford in north-west England to Scottish parents in 1915. Already a star by the 1950s, his Dirty Old Town became one of the iconic folk songs of the generation. Also a member of both the Clarion singing circles and Young Communist League, he had met Luke Kelly during his first visit to Britain and was sufficiently impressed to take him under his wing in 1964. At that time MacColl had a group called The Critics which had developed from the Singers’ Club he and Peggy Seeger ran. Based in folk mecca the Pindar of Wakefield pub in London, where Bob Dylan had played his first British gig in 1962, The Critics were a polymathic group engaged not only in folk music but drama and poetry, and attempting to blend these different art forms in a way that might deepen the cultural revolution underway. This suited Luke Kelly who by this time was in a relationship with Irish-American actress Deirdre O’Connell, a pioneering figure in proliferating the Stanislavski method of acting in western Europe. Luke continued his political involvement at this time too, becoming more active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Again, he found his politics and his musical endeavors very much in tune, adding songs like Ian Campbell’s The Sun is Burning, then the unofficial anthem of the CND, to his repertoire. Under Ewan MacColl’s guidance Luke Kelly also learned numerous workers’ songs, from Schoolday’s Over to Hot Asphalt, as well as MacColl’s classics Dirty Old Town, The Travelling People, Shoals of Herring and Come Me Little Son, each of which Kelly would produce remarkable recordings of in the coming years. After a two-year apprenticeship with MacColl, Luke Kelly returned to Dublin and The Dubliners, which by this stage were growing in renown. John Sheahan had joined the group in Luke Kelly’s absence and it now contained an array of musicians who were individually talented. On his return, Luke Kelly’s performances grew in intensity, with his Critics training aiding his delivery. But it wasn’t only his singing that drew attention—Kelly had always played a five-string banjo, a peculiar variation of the instrument Irish audiences were familiar with, but he now developed a technique of standing bolt upright which made his appearance onstage all the more striking. These were conscious echoes by Kelly of an American banjo tradition which weaved from west African slaves through the Wobbly union organizers of the early 20th century and into bluegrass and the 1960s. Luke Kelly’s determination to combine his music with radical politics continued on his return to Ireland. By now a card-carrying communist in one of Europe’s most vociferously anti-communist states, he used his growing musical reputation to hold an election rally in 1965 for ‘Red’ Mick O’Riordan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Ireland and a veteran of the Connolly Column international brigade in the Spanish civil war. Though O’Riordan was quick to joke that there were more attendees at the concert than votes in the election, this ongoing commitment to politics was a brave stand for someone aspiring to make it in Ireland’s music industry. The Dubliners’ big breakthrough arrived in 1967, and owed much to state repression—though probably not the kind Luke Kelly imagined. In keeping with the group’s gregarious image they had released an album entitled A Drop of the Hard Stuff. The LP included numerous irreverent and humorous songs, including Weile Waile and Brendan Behan’s Zoological Gardens. But the most controversial was the album’s first single, Seven Drunken Nights, a parody sung by Ronnie Drew of a drunkard arriving home to find his wife having an affair—only to be convinced by ever-more-absurd yarns that his eyes are deceiving him. The raunchy content of this song was too much for the Irish censors, who promptly banned it. Inevitably, the effect of this injunction was to catapult the song to the top of the Irish charts, selling 40,000 copies in two days. Perhaps more surprising was the impact this scandal had on the British charts—with the Dubliners becoming the first Irish band to make the top ten, eventually reaching number 7. Famously, when Ronnie Drew was told the song had made it to the charts, he responded by asking whether that was a good thing. The next year, the Dubliners arrived in America, featuring on Ed Sullivan’s St. Patrick’s Day show in 1968. Although they were forbidden from singing Seven Drunken Nights — “you’re not going to sing that immoral song on my show,” Barney McKenna recalled Sullivan saying—their presence was nonetheless remarkable. In the preceding years Ed Sullivan had been working with the intelligence services to ensure no Communists appeared on his show, but it seems in this instance he assumed a folk group from devout Ireland not worthy of investigating. But by 1968 this caricature of the ‘Emerald Isle’ was increasingly distant from reality. The country was in the grip of profound social upheaval, influenced by international developments but also informed by the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in Ireland. Notoriously, to mark that occasion, left-wing republican group Saor Éire had blown up Nelson’s Pillar on Dublin’s main thoroughfare of O’Connell Street. The next night The Dubliners appeared on stage carrying the pillar’s head, causing uproar in a deeply anti-republican mainstream press. This context was added to by a growing students’ movement, support groups for anti-colonial struggles around the world and a Dublin Housing Action Committee that was fighting homelessness and poor accommodation by squatting empty buildings around the city. This, in particular, was a cause close to Luke Kelly’s heart, remarking at the time, “I would like to see… the abolition of every moldy, seedy, and uninhabitable dwelling and to do this you have to give priority to the extirpation of private — and of capitalist necessity, vicious — landlords.” But the most prominent political development of the period was the rise of the Northern Irish Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which brought thousands to the streets of northern cities and towns to demand rights from the sectarian Orange state. After this movement was met with police repression and violence ensued in 1969, Luke Kelly and The Dubliners headlined a peace rally in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. He followed this a month later by debuting one of his own creations, For What Died the Sons of Róisín, a poem which bitterly condemned the mercenary turn of Irish society since the 1916 Rising and the failure of its republican vision.

Revolution By the end of the 1960s Luke Kelly was convinced that The Dubliners needed to be creatively challenged and take a more overtly political turn in their music. The means to achieve this seemed odd to many, with the band coming under the management of Phil Coulter, a songwriter and producer better known for working with pop groups such as the Bay City Rollers. To many people’s surprise, the partnership worked and The Dubliners produced an album entitled Revolution in 1970, launched in Dublin’s Kilmainham Jail where the leaders of the 1916 Rising had been executed. Revolution lived up to its name in both form and content, with a piano, bass and second guitar added to the band’s musical arrangement. The tracks also amounted to its most political oeuvre to date, with songs including American civil rights ballad Alabama 1958, labor anthem Joe Hill, anti-nuclear weapons song The Button Pusher, as well as anti-fascist tune The Peat Bog Soldiers. A year later these were followed by Hand Me Down My Bible, which Luke Kelly would often preface with an ironic tribute to the Reverend Ian Paisley, and Free the People. The latter song was written as a protest against the introduction of internment in Northern Ireland, a policy which saw thousands imprisoned without trial. While none of these more political songs could be considered The Dubliners or Luke Kelly’s greatest musical achievements, the creative environment which produced them was to nourish truly extraordinary renditions. In the early to mid-1970s, Luke Kelly recorded three tracks which would come to be regarded as amongst his best. The first, on Revolution itself, was Scorn Not His Simplicity, a remarkable song penned by Coulter about his down syndrome son. An early attempt to come to terms with tragic aspects of disability and to counter prejudice, the raw emotion of the song is overpowering but Luke Kelly declined to allow it slip into sentimentality—performing it only once in public. This was followed in 1972 by On Raglan Road, one of the great works of renowned Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh, which he himself gave to Luke Kelly to turn into a song. In the recorded version the haunting beauty of the lyrics comes together with the strength of Kelly’s delivery to create one of twentieth century Ireland’s greatest works of art. In 1974 the heights of political and cultural expression in Kelly’s repertoire were finally united when he sang Coulter’s Town I Loved So Well, a lament about the increasingly repressive and violent conditions in Ireland’s northern six counties which threatened to destroy the romance of Coulter’s native Derry. Throughout this period Luke Kelly kept up his political activity. He became a prominent supporter of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, headlining concerts in support of the liberation movement and publicly rejecting offers for The Dubliners to tour the country. He sang at gigs supporting Traveller housing initiatives, keen to emphasize the contributions Travellers had made to the development of Irish music. He also made a number of strong interventions in the press. In one such interview, with journalist Joe McAnthony, he would explain how he saw the relationship between his music and his politics: You’ve only got to look around you to see the injustice in the system. I’m a socialist because I believe it will change all of that. I would stop singing and work at any job with my hands at any time if I thought it would help to improve things for people. I want to see the time coming when, say, a child will get the opportunity to use his brains. We didn’t get that chance and it still doesn’t exist today regardless of what people say. In 1973 Luke Kelly also managed to return to the stage in a prominent role for the first time, earning accolades for his performance as King Herod in Noel Pearson’s Jesus Christ Superstar in the Gaiety Theatre. Though it wasn’t to mark a more sustained shift into theater it was an aspect of artistry Kelly felt he had neglected and he later remarked on his pride at carrying it off. The Dubliners managed a few more good recordings as the decade wore on. The Unquiet Grave on the album Now is beautiful and Parcel of Rogues is an excellent tribute to the best of the Scots tradition, including also a great rendition of 1916 anthem The Foggy Dew. But perhaps the most poignant of them all is the recording of The Auld Triangle, the song popularized by Brendan Behan. Although they never met—Luke played regularly alongside Behan’s brother Dominic, another remarkable songwriter—there was an undeniable connection between Brendan Behan and Luke Kelly. Two Dubliners who brought the wit and personality of the city, as well as the lyricism of its accent, to the world, their lives also illustrate a theme that has come to define the arts in Ireland: the close relationship between creation and destruction.
Ancient Roman leaders once made decisions about important events, such as when to hold elections or where to build new cities, based on the presence or flight patterns of birds. Builders often omit the thirteenth floor from their floor plans, and many pedestrians go well out of their way to avoid walking under a ladder.

While it’s widely recognized that superstitions like these are not rational, many persist, guiding the behavior of large groups of people even today.

In a new analysis driven by game theory, two theoretical biologists devised a model that shows how superstitious beliefs can become established in a society’s social norms. Their work, which appears in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates how groups of individuals, each starting with distinct belief systems, can evolve a coordinated set of behaviors that are enforced by a set of consistent social norms.

“What’s interesting here is that we show that, beginning in a system where no one has any particular belief system, a set of beliefs can emerge, and from those, a set of coordinated behaviors,” says Erol Akçay, an assistant professor of biology at Penn.

“Slowly, these actors accumulate superstitions,” adds Bryce Morsky, a postdoctoral researcher. “They may say, ‘Ok, well I believe that when I observe this event I should behave this way because another person will behave that way,’ and over time, if they have success in using that kind of a strategy, the superstitions catch on and can become evolutionarily stable.”

Morsky and Akçay’s work is an application of game theory, which attempts to predict how people will interact and make decisions in a social setting. They specifically considered what are known as correlated equilibria, scenarios in which all actors are given correlated signals that dictate their response to any given situation.

“A classic example is a traffic light,” says Akçay. “If two people are approaching an intersection, one will get a ‘stop’ signal and one will get a ‘go’ signal and everybody knows that. It’s rational for both parties to obey the light.”

The signal, in this case the traffic light, is known as a correlating device, or more evocatively, a “choreographer.” But the Penn team wanted to know what would happen if there was no choreographer. If people could pay attention to a variety of other signals that could direct their actions, and their beliefs were transmitted according to the success of their actions, would coordinated behaviors arise? In other words, can evolution act as a “blind choreographer?”

“What if a cyclist is riding toward an intersection, and instead of a traffic light they see a cat,” Akçay says. “The cat is irrelevant to the intersection, but maybe the person decides that if they see a black cat, that means they should stop, or that maybe that means the approaching cyclist is going to stop.”

Despite the color of a cat having no bearing on the likelihood of an approaching cyclist stopping or going, sometimes this kind of conditional strategy might result in a higher payoff to the cyclist—if it is correlated with superstitions of other cyclists.

“Sometimes it may be rational to hold these irrational beliefs,” Morsky notes.

In their model, Morsky and Akçay assume that individuals are rational, in that they do not follow a norm blindly, but only do so when their beliefs make it seem beneficial. They change their beliefs by imitating successful people’s beliefs. This creates an evolutionary dynamic where the norms “compete” against one another, rising and falling in prevalence through the group. This evolutionary process eventually leads to the formation of new social norms.

Morsky and Akçay showed that the evolutionarily stable norms, those that cannot be replaced by others, have to be consistent, meaning that they successfully coordinate individual behavior even in the absence of an external “choreographer. “

They found that these evolutionarily stable norms, in both prescribing how an actor should behave and also describing that actor’s expectations of how others should behave, create a consistent belief system that helps coordinate the overall behavior of many actors, even if that coordination is not being directed by any outside choreographer.

To further explore their findings, the researchers hope to engage in social experiments to see whether individuals might start devising their own superstitions or beliefs when none are provided.

“What I like about this work,” says Morsky, “is that these beliefs are made-up superstitions, but they become real because everybody actually follows them, so you create this social reality. I’m really interesting in testing that further.”

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr had taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest during his panel’s probe — but also corresponded with the White House. | Win McNamee/Getty Images mueller investigation Mueller report ropes in Senate GOP Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr apparently supplied the White House counsel’s office with information about the Russia probe.

The Senate GOP found itself ensnared in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report Thursday, with new revelations about Sen. Richard Burr's communications with the White House and details about a GOP aide’s quest to obtain Hillary Clinton‘s emails.

Though the vast majority of the report centered on Russian influence in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump’s apparent efforts to undercut Mueller’s probe, the report also offers a window into how the broad investigations have touched on individual senators and even a relatively unknown congressional staffer. It also shows how eager the White House was for insight into the series of federal probes that were launched early in Trump’s presidency.

Story Continued Below

Senate Intelligence Chairman Burr (R-N.C.), for instance, apparently supplied the White House counsel's office with information about FBI investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to the report. The report says that on March 9, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey briefed congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference. That briefing included "an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation."

Burr then corresponded with the White House a week later about the Russia probes, and the White House counsel's office, led by Don McGahn, "appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation," the special counsel report said.

Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Burr, said that the senator “does not recall this specific conversation with Mr. McGahn in March of 2017; however, any conversations between the two would have been in reference to the need for White House personnel to voluntarily comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation.”

The Senate Intelligence probe has been widely viewed on Capitol Hill as more productive than its corresponding House investigation. There's been far less infighting and Burr has taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest, including skipping meetings with Trump while he's been overseeing investigations. Former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), now the committee's ranking member, was seen by Democrats as far more partisan than Burr in his probes.

“If specific individuals were discussed, they would have been those known to the committee, the White House, and the media. The Chairman’s stewardship over the Committee’s bipartisan and fact-based investigation over the last two years speaks for itself,” Carroll said.

But Burr communicating with Trump's aides about the FBI probe could undercut some of those warm bipartisan feelings. The Senate Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Mark Warner (D-Va.), did not respond to a request for comment but Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the panel, made an indirect reference to Burr in a statement on Thursday.

"Given evidence from the Mueller report, the committee must take steps to ensure its investigations do not leak to the executive branch," he said.

On March 16, 2017, the White House counsel's office was briefed by Burr on "4-5 targets" of the Russia probe, according to notes taken by McGahn's chief of staff, Annie Donaldson.

Those targets were identified as former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, campaign aide Carter Page and "Greek Guy" George Papadopoulos, who was charged with lying to the FBI, according to Donaldson's notes. Those notes say Burr said Manafort was under investigation for Ukraine and Russia dealings — not his work for the Trump campaign — and that Page was being targeted for the "$ game."

McGahn and Donaldson said that they believed those people were being investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the special counsel's office was skeptical.

The committee "does not formally investigate individuals as 'targets'; the notes on their face reference the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Comey; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the FBI for Comey's briefing to the Gang of 8 [congressional leaders] on March 9," the Mueller report reads.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also found himself mentioned briefly in the report, though there was no reference his 2016 meeting with intelligence officials, in which former Vice President Joe Biden alleged the Kentucky Republican declined to join a bipartisan statement on Russian hacking.

Instead, the GOP leader made a cameo amid Mueller’s inquiry on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

McConnell spoke to McGahn about Sessions, according to the report: "McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to avert Sessions's recusal by speaking to Sessions's personal counsel, Sessions's chief of staff, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times."

Sessions' decision to recuse himself prompted Trump to call for his resignation. But his then-chief of staff Reince Priebus warned against the move, arguing that the administration would not be able to get a new attorney general confirmed "and that the Department of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President." Trump responded he could make a recess appointment. But that would have been untenable, since pro forma sessions now block recess appointments.

The report also offered new information about the work of a GOP Senate aide to obtain Clinton’s deleted emails during the 2016 election.

Barbara Ledeen, a Senate Judiciary Committee aide, apparently communicated with Peter Smith, an investment advisor, who was also interested in finding Clinton’s emails.

In a December 2015 exchange cited in the report, Ledeen wrote to Smith about an unnamed individual who could obtain the Clinton emails “which 1. Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies.” She added “that would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.” Ledeen attached a proposal in the e-mail that suggested Chinese, Russian and Iranian intelligence services could put together the content on Clinton’s email server. Smith declined to participate in Ledeen’s plan, the report said.

Both were later contacted by former Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn, who had been directed by Trump to find the Clinton emails.

Ledeen and Smith reconnected in 2016, and according to the Mueller report, Ledeen said that she obtained what appeared to be Clinton’s deleted emails via the dark web. But a tech advisor to Erik Prince, a businessman and Trump campaign supporter, found that the emails were not real.

A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the former Judiciary chairman, said that Ledeen’s activities were “unrelated to the Judiciary Committee’s oversight work and she was never a member of the oversight team.

“Ledeen’s inquiry was not authorized by the Judiciary Committee. In fact the committee staff didn’t learn of her involvement until after it had been completed. She was instructed not to do any further follow-up once the committee learned of her involvement,” said the spokesman.

Ledeen remains an aide on the committee.

Mykonos Petros the Pelican,is the official mascot of Mykonos

You will spot him where you least expect, within the narrow walkways of the islands’ labyrinth, with dozens of folks gathered around trying to take selfies or just get a shot of him. Leonardo de Caprio-NOT. Mykonos has its own celebrity—a friendly feathered pelican with a snapping yellow beak that comes before everything else.

Mykonos’ “big bird” has benefited from celebrity status since the late 50s. The injured bird was discovered on the shores of Mykonos by a local fisherman. He rescued the bird and nursed him back to health. With the support and benevolence of locals he became a fixture on the waterfront, always around when fishermen brought the mornings catch, so he could enjoy any “surplus.” Petros, as he was eventually named,

is the official mascot of Mykonos. Petros has always been a bit of an enigma as his species of pelican is not indigenous to the island or even the Aegean.

(Barba Antonis Haritopoulos, the fisherman who rescued Petros)

He has greeted queens and celebrities who have visited the island and was even presented with a gift from Jackie Kennedy Onasis—a female pelican to keep him company.

Greeks were generally not inclined to keeping animals as pets. However, their adoration for Petros was undeniable. One fine morning, the still young and restless bird decided to fly and visit the nearby island of Tinos. The residents there considered the visit as voluntary migration and decided to keep

him. Petros’ alleged entrapment in Tinos was the first (and last) court case in Greece where the custody of a bird was disputed, the avian equivalent of the abduction of Helen of Troy. When the authorities decided in their favor and the captive pelican was returned to them, the Mykonians threw a welcome party with music, dancing and a public feast. Even the solemn Orthodox and Catholic priests(both denominations are present on the island) literally chimed in,festively ringing the bells of all the churches in town.

In the mid 1980s, the original Petros was fatally struck by a car on the waterfront. As the original bird had such popularity and seemed to have developed into the Mykonian Mascot, he was posthumously replaced. Since then there is always a pelican on Mykonos who, honorifically, was given the name Petros.Mykonos Petros the Pelican

Petros managed to rise to such mythical status, reaching a point where he effectively overshadowed many of the impressive local symbols, such as the marble lions of Delos and the whitewashed, stone-carved churches. At one stage, he almost competed in worldwide recognition with the perennial landmarks of the island, the famous windmills. By charming locals and tourists alike – posing patiently for a “click” alongside kings, hippies and jetsetters – the tirel ess and docile bird was soon promoted to island mascot. Pictures, sketches and portraits of him by local artists made their way onto postcards, t-shirts, coffee mugs, cigarette lighters, hotel and restaurant brands.Certainly the most photographed persona on the island and resident symbol of both sea and sky for almost 60 years, he escapes the Paparazzi in his own personal nest: Cine Manto Mykonos. You can find him on a given afternoon flapping hisfeathers, stretching his beak or just doing general preening in the center of town at the cinema, aka Meletopoulos’ Garden.Petros the Pelican

A few weeks ago Microsoft closed their digital bookstore and customers have lost access to all of the ebooks they paid for. This is not a small startup, where people throw their hands up in the air and exclaim “oh well.” Microsoft is an established giant and the fact that they failed at ebooks proves that Amazon dominates the entire US market and it is impossible to compete against them. Microsoft has also proved that customers do not have true ownership of an ebook, they are merely licensed.

Microsoft is just the latest in a longline of companies that have shuttered their bookstore and left readers in a larch. This includes Blinkbox Books, Parable Books, Diesel e-books, Scholastic Storia, Sony Reader Store, the Barnes and Noble Nook UK store and a bunch of others have completely closed their doors and left customers with all sorts of questions and concerns when their apps stopped working and their library is deleted.

The vast majority of ebooks from major online retailers have digital rights management from Adobe or have developed their own DRM solution. If you buy an ebook Amazon, it is incompatible with your Kobo or Nook. The only way you can circumvent this is to illegally strip the DRM from your book. Opting into DRM basically is a matter of trust. You are trusting the company to send you the book and that they will provide access to it.

I believe that ebooks are suffering from a crisis of confidence. It is beginning to be quite difficult to trust a retailer to not disappear overnight with your ebooks, no matter how big they are. You can literary spend thousands of dollars and they just disappear overnight. Microsoft is at least offering refunds, but most other retailers are there one minute and gone the next.

Maybe the crux of the ebook issue, is more psychological than anything. People’s sense of psychological ownership is affected by three primary factors: whether they feel as if they have control over the object they own, whether they use the object to define who they are, and whether the object helps give them a sense of belonging in society. A recent study published in the journal Electronic Markets found that the vast majority of people felt a constricted sense of ownership of ebooks versus physical books, based on the fact that they don’t have full control over the products. For example, they expressed frustration that they often could not copy a digital file to multiple devices. Along similar lines, many study participants lamented restrictions on sharing ebooks with friends, or gifting or selling the books, saying this made ebooks feel less valuable as possessions than physical books.

Sabrina Helm, a UA associate professor who researches consumer perceptions and behaviors. said “One of the conclusions of our research was that digital books and physical books are entirely different products,” she said. “ebooks feel like more of a service experience; overall, they seem to offer a more functional or utilitarian experience. You have much more richness if you deal with a physical book, where all your senses are involved.

Digital bookstores rise and fall and thousand of customers are left with nothing to show for the money they spent. This is likely the reason why every year, ebook sales fall a few percentage points and print is on the rise. Print is trustworthy, ebooks are not.


La journaliste et écrivaine Djemila Benhabib affirme qu'Adil Charkaoui mène contre elle une campagne d'intimidation visant à lui faire perdre son emploi.

En entrevue avec Benoît Dutrizac à QUB radio, Mme Benhabib a déclaré qu'elle allait «donner suite» aux menaces de Charkaoui.

Ce dernier, par l'entremise de sa page Facebook «Collectif canadien anti-islamophobie», a révélé où elle travaillait.

«Je prends cette menace très, très au sérieux. Je vais donner suite. Ça ne peut pas s’arrêter là. Il a déjà mené une campagne contre moi en 2014 pour me destituer de ma candidature alors que j’étais candidate aux élections provinciales. C’est une campagne qui dure, donc on peut appeler ça du harcèlement», a-t-elle indiqué.

Mme Benhabib avait toujours fait attention de ne pas révéler ces informations.

«C’est sur son site. Vous comprendrez que, moi, je n’ai jamais rendu publiques mes activités professionnelles, pour des questions sécuritaires, et que, là, je me trouve vraiment dans l’eau chaude, parce que, maintenant, les gens savent que j’enseigne à l’Université Laval, ce que je n’ai jamais, au grand jamais rendu public, encore une fois», a-t-elle expliqué à l'animateur Benoît Dutrizac.

Elle a également indiqué que ce genre de situation fait partie de son quotidien depuis la parution du livre où elle pourfend l'islam politique.

«Ça fait partie intégrante de ma vie depuis la publication de Ma vie à contre-Coran. Ça fait 10 ans. Je vis avec cette donnée-là, mais ça ne me perturbe pas. Je continue à militer pour mes idéaux. Ce sont des idéaux humanistes: la laïcité, le droit des femmes, la lutte contre l’islam politique, qui est un cancer planétaire. Il n’y a rien pour m’arrêter», a exprimé Djemila Benhabib.

George Conway, the husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and a fierce critic of President Trump, penned an op-ed in The Washington Post that calls Trump a "cancer on the presidency" and urged Congress to take action to remove him from office.

After 22 months, a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia interference report was made available to the public. The report showed no evidence that Trump’s team “coordinated or conspired” with Russia, but many Democrats pointed out that Mueller identified 10 times where there was potential obstruction, and essentially left the next steps up to Congress.

Mueller wrote that Trump’s efforts to obstruct “were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.”

READ THE FULL REPORT

He continued, “The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."

Trump's team late Thursday appeared to take a wait-and-see approach on how the public absorbed the findings. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, seemed to be in no particular hurry to release a 45-page rebuttal when asked about it on CNN. The White House claimed total victory and vindication for the president

Conway, who has clashed publicly with the president before and questioned his mental fitness, barely touches collusion in his piece but highlighted the obstruction argument.

"Mueller couldn’t say, with any “confidence,” that the president of the United States is not a criminal. He said, stunningly, that “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” Mueller did not so state," Conway wrote.

He pointed out that even if Trump did not reach the threshold of criminality, he could still be impeached based on earlier precedent. He called on Congress to act to “excise” the cancer in the White House “without delay.”

There is no love lost between Trump and Conway. Trump has called Conway a “stone cold LOSER & husband from hell.”

MUELLER REPORT THE 'BEGINNING OF THE BEGINNING': AXIOS EDTIOR

“George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I, with her help, didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!” Trump tweeted in March.

Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, wrote in the New York Post that Trump could have simply shut down the investigation and assert executive privilege to “deny the special counsel access to key White House witnesses,” but he didn’t.

“Most important, the special counsel found that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and that the president’s frustration wasn’t over fear of guilt — the typical motivation for obstruction — but that the investigation was undermining his ability to govern the country,” McCarthy wrote.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr had taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest during his panel’s probe — but also corresponded with the White House. | Win McNamee/Getty Images mueller investigation Mueller report ropes in Senate GOP Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr apparently supplied the White House counsel’s office with information about the Russia probe.

The Senate GOP found itself ensnared in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report Thursday, with new revelations about Sen. Richard Burr's communications with the White House and details about a GOP aide’s quest to obtain Hillary Clinton‘s emails.

Though the vast majority of the report centered on Russian influence in the 2016 election and President Donald Trump’s apparent efforts to undercut Mueller’s probe, the report also offers a window into how the broad investigations have touched on individual senators and even a relatively unknown congressional staffer. It also shows how eager the White House was for insight into the series of federal probes that were launched early in Trump’s presidency.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Burr (R-N.C.), for instance, apparently supplied the White House counsel's office with information about FBI investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to the report. The report says that on March 9, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey briefed congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference. That briefing included "an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation."

Burr then corresponded with the White House a week later about the Russia probes, and the White House counsel's office, led by Don McGahn, "appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation," the special counsel report said.

Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Burr, said that the senator “does not recall this specific conversation with Mr. McGahn in March of 2017; however, any conversations between the two would have been in reference to the need for White House personnel to voluntarily comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation.”

The Senate Intelligence probe has been widely viewed on Capitol Hill as more productive than its corresponding House investigation. There's been far less infighting and Burr has taken steps to distance himself from conflicts of interest, including skipping meetings with Trump while he's been overseeing investigations. Former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), now the committee's ranking member, was seen by Democrats as far more partisan than Burr in his probes.

“If specific individuals were discussed, they would have been those known to the committee, the White House, and the media. The Chairman’s stewardship over the Committee’s bipartisan and fact-based investigation over the last two years speaks for itself,” Carroll said.

But Burr communicating with Trump's aides about the FBI probe could undercut some of those warm bipartisan feelings. The Senate Intelligence Committee's ranking member, Mark Warner (D-Va.), did not respond to a request for comment but Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the panel, made an indirect reference to Burr in a statement on Thursday.

"Given evidence from the Mueller report, the committee must take steps to ensure its investigations do not leak to the executive branch," he said.

On March 16, 2017, the White House counsel's office was briefed by Burr on "4-5 targets" of the Russia probe, according to notes taken by McGahn's chief of staff, Annie Donaldson.

Those targets were identified as former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, campaign aide Carter Page and "Greek Guy" George Papadopoulos, who was charged with lying to the FBI, according to Donaldson's notes. Those notes say Burr said Manafort was under investigation for Ukraine and Russia dealings — not his work for the Trump campaign — and that Page was being targeted for the "$ game."

McGahn and Donaldson said that they believed those people were being investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the special counsel's office was skeptical.

The committee "does not formally investigate individuals as 'targets'; the notes on their face reference the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Comey; and the notes track the background materials prepared by the FBI for Comey's briefing to the Gang of 8 [congressional leaders] on March 9," the Mueller report reads.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also found himself mentioned briefly in the report, though there was no reference his 2016 meeting with intelligence officials, in which former Vice President Joe Biden alleged the Kentucky Republican declined to join a bipartisan statement on Russian hacking.

Instead, the GOP leader made a cameo amid Mueller’s inquiry on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.

McConnell spoke to McGahn about Sessions, according to the report: "McGahn continued trying on behalf of the President to avert Sessions's recusal by speaking to Sessions's personal counsel, Sessions's chief of staff, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and by contacting Sessions himself two more times."

Sessions' decision to recuse himself prompted Trump to call for his resignation. But his then-chief of staff Reince Priebus warned against the move, arguing that the administration would not be able to get a new attorney general confirmed "and that the Department of Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President." Trump responded he could make a recess appointment. But that would have been untenable, since pro forma sessions now block recess appointments.

The report also offered new information about the work of a GOP Senate aide to obtain Clinton’s deleted emails during the 2016 election.

Barbara Ledeen, a Senate Judiciary Committee aide, apparently communicated with Peter Smith, an investment advisor, who was also interested in finding Clinton’s emails.

In a December 2015 exchange cited in the report, Ledeen wrote to Smith about an unnamed individual who could obtain the Clinton emails “which 1. Were classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies.” She added “that would demonstrate what needs to be demonstrated.” Ledeen attached a proposal in the e-mail that suggested Chinese, Russian and Iranian intelligence services could put together the content on Clinton’s email server. Smith declined to participate in Ledeen’s plan, the report said.

Both were later contacted by former Trump campaign adviser Michael Flynn, who had been directed by Trump to find the Clinton emails.

Ledeen and Smith reconnected in 2016, and according to the Mueller report, Ledeen said that she obtained what appeared to be Clinton’s deleted emails via the dark web. But a tech advisor to Erik Prince, a businessman and Trump campaign supporter, found that the emails were not real.

A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the former Judiciary chairman, said that Ledeen’s activities were “unrelated to the Judiciary Committee’s oversight work and she was never a member of the oversight team.

“Ledeen’s inquiry was not authorized by the Judiciary Committee. In fact the committee staff didn’t learn of her involvement until after it had been completed. She was instructed not to do any further follow-up once the committee learned of her involvement,” said the spokesman.

Ledeen remains an aide on the committee.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Millions of voters across swathes of southern India cast ballots on Thursday in the second phase of a mammoth, staggered general election, as sporadic violence flared in the east and the insurgency-wracked state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Election Commission said 66 percent of more than 155 million eligible Indians had voted, as per provisional data, in 95 constituencies in 12 states. Results of the election to India’s 545-member parliament are expected on May 23.

In focus are the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where the main opposition Congress party and its allies need to win big if they hope to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi from securing a second straight term.

Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have run an aggressive campaign, playing to their nationalist, Hindu-first base and attacking rivals they accuse of appeasing minorities.

Critics say such divisive rhetoric threatens India’s secular foundations.

“Communal polarization is the biggest issue for me,” said Rakesh Mehar, who voted in the technology hub of Bengaluru, capital of Karnataka. “And the growing intolerance in the country is what worries me the most.”

Sporadic violence was reported in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, where separatists have called for an election boycott, and the eastern state of West Bengal, which has a history of election clashes.

Police fired teargas to disperse stone-throwers in Srinagar, the Himalayan region’s main city, where thousands of troops had been deployed to guard the vote, although turnout was less than 8 percent, according to provisional election commission data.

“There has been stone pelting by protesters in at least 40 places,” said a senior police officer who sought anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.

Police in the West Bengal constituency of Darjeeling also fired tear gas at protesters who complained they had not been allowed to vote, said top district official Arvind Kumar Mina.

“They had blocked a highway and had to be dispersed,” he added.

SWEEPING VICTORIES

In the last general election in 2014, the BJP recorded sweeping victories in six northern states that delivered 70 percent of its seats, helping clinch a landslide majority, said academic Neelanjan Sircar.

“You can never expect you’ll do that again,” added Sircar, a political science professor at Ashoka University near the capital New Delhi. “Those seats that you lose, you’ll have to make up somewhere.”

Eastern and southern India would be where the BJP would look to make up those seats, analysts say.

Congress, which is focusing on concerns about growing joblessness and farmers’ distress, is staking its chances on a promise of generous handouts to India’s poorest families.

“People are talking about national issues,” said Manjunath Munirathnappa, a voter in Bengaluru, who hoped lawmakers would resolve infrastructure woes, such as traffic congestion and inadequate water supply.

“But only when they fix the local issues will there be progress.”

About 900 million people are eligible to vote in the election that began last week and ends next month.

On Thursday morning, the body of a 20-year-old worker for the BJP’s youth wing was found hanging from a tree in West Bengal’s Purulia district, party officials and local police said.

“The night before he died he was seen writing graffiti for BJP for the elections. In the night he was reported missing. His body was found today,” said local BJP leader Vidyasagar Chakrabarty.

Tensions between the BJP and the regional Trinamool Congressthat governs the state have been rising in the lead-up to the poll, with each accusing the other of killings, beatings, vandalism and making false allegations to the police.

Trinamool Congress local leader Shantiram Mahato said the party had asked the police to conduct an impartial investigation into the death of the BJP worker.

「子どもの命優先の法改正を」 被害生徒の父ら意見書提出

学校でのいじめ被害を受けた児童生徒の家族有志と大津市は１９日、いじめ防止対策推進法の改正に向けて議論している超党派国会議員勉強会（座長・馳浩元文部科学相）に対し、いじめを根絶して子どもの命を守る同法の趣旨をより強める方向で法改正を急ぐよう求める意見書を提出した。

２０１３年の同法施行以降もいじめ事案が相次いでいることを受け、超党派勉強会は被害者家族の意見も聞きながら改正法の条文案づくりを進めている。昨年１２月にまとめられた条文案は教職員によるいじめの放置・助長を明確に禁じ、懲戒処分の対象とすることなどを盛り込んでいたが、今月に示された座長試案では懲戒規定が削除された。

同勉強会事務局次長の小西洋之参院議員らに意見書を提出した後、文部科学省で被害者家族らが会見した。１１年にいじめを苦に自殺した大津市の男子中学生＝当時（１３）＝の父親（５３）は、懲戒規定の削除について「教師が萎縮すると考えたのだろうが、学校がいじめ防止対策をしっかり決めれば現場の教師に責任を押しつけられることがなくなる。大人の都合ではなく、子どもの命を優先した法改正を求める」と強調した。大津市役所で会見した越直美市長も「学校現場で子どもの命を守ることを第一に考え、事件の反省に立った大津の取り組みを生かしてほしい」と述べた。

Following the passing of cryptocurrency legislation in France, the country’s government has now turned its attention to the rest of the EU to follow in its footsteps. During the Paris Blockchain Week summit, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire strongly recommended that EU neighbours adopt France’s approach to regulating digital assets.

France has been working on creating a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency since 2018. The country’s efforts culminated in April 2019, when the government approved laws dealing with tax and licensing of digital currencies. According to Le Maire, France’s “model is the right one”, and he invited all EU countries to open a discussion about a single, French-inspired, cross border framework agreement.

The new laws will allow brokers of virtual currencies and create regulation for the issuing of crypto tokens, which will lead them to be able to obtain operating licenses from the market regulator. Another significant piece of legislation focuses on tax on revenue. As in other markets, every crypto transaction, whether performed by an issuer, custodian, exchange, or investment, will be subject to a tax on capital gains.

An important aspect of this regulatory framework is for the proper and safe identification of the users. The regulation requires improved know-your-customer (KYC) processes, together with verification of the identity of token issuers and brokers. In this way, the country’s legislators hope to step up the fight against money laundering and fraudulent entities.

The European Response

In a statement, the European Commission agreed with France’s suggestion of an EU-wide regulatory framework focusing on the cryptocurrency industry. However, progress between member states has been slow and inconsistent. Some member states, such as Malta, have already enacted several laws dealing with the industry, but other members have been slower in their actions.

Calls have been made for a unified cryptocurrency regulatory code for the bloc. Without such legislation, the EU runs the risk of having internal disagreements caused by different countries with conflicting virtual currency laws.

At the start of April, Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s Competitions Commissioner stated that the bloc does not need to wait for a global agreement on crypto matters and can push ahead with its own regulation. The Commissioner is known for being a strong advocate for implementing crypto legislation, particularly in the area of tax harmonisation.

Vestager, who was Denmark’s economy minister until 2014, has a reputation for standing up to tech giants. She, together with a growing number of Eurocrats, have put continual pressure on the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, and others to pay their fair share of taxes.

There is the possibility that Vestager’s digital tax proposal, currently under review, will be modified to include cryptocurrency legislation. If it does, it may mark one of the world’s most significant developments in the industry, and will continue to push cryptocurrency into the mainstream market.

Premier-designate Jason Kenney met with outgoing Premier Rachel Notley Thursday, both promising a smooth power transition following an antagonistic campaign period that ended with a UCP victory.

“The election is behind us,” said Kenney, adding he hopes the legislature fosters a culture of mutual respect and civility.

Notley, who plans to stay on as Opposition leader, said the two leaders discussed various issues including Bill 12, the turn-off-the-taps legislation brought in by the NDP to choke off oil exports to British Columbia.

“It was fine … we know where we disagree,” Notley said of the meeting at Government House. “There are some objectives that we both agree on.”

The talk followed news that Ottawa is delaying its decision on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project until June 18. That long-awaited decision was expected in May.

Kenney said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told him about the delay on Wednesday during a phone conversation, and the federal government is acting on legal advice to ensure proper consultation with Indigenous communities.

“We certainly don’t want them to have to go back to the drawing board a third time on this,” he said.

Notley, who has repeatedly called the pipeline project the fight of her life, said Thursday the setback is disappointing.

“What it does demonstrate is that it’s not as simple as having press conferences and expressing people’s outrage over and over,” she said, hinting at Kenney’s continued promises to put more pressure on Ottawa to move the pipeline forward.

“This is a complicated country,” she said. “It involves considered diplomacy and strategic pressure in a thoughtful way.”

The deadline is being pushed back by almost a month on the recommendation of both Indigenous communities and former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci, who is advising the government on the consultation process, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said Thursday.

“The government has consistently said that a decision would only be made on the project once we are satisfied that the duty to consult has been met,” Sohi said in a statement.

The proposal to twin the existing Trans Mountain pipeline between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C., was first approved by cabinet in 2016. The Federal Court of Appeal quashed that decision last August, however, declaring that neither the environmental review nor the Indigenous consultations had been properly completed.

After taking into consideration the impact of more oil tankers on marine life off the coast of B.C., the National Energy Board said on Feb. 22 that it still believed the project is in the public interest and should go ahead, subject to 156 conditions and 16 new non-binding recommendations for Ottawa.

That decision gave cabinet 90 days to make its call, setting May 22 as the expected deadline. But even as that report was being finalized, officials in Sohi’s office were signalling that more time would likely be required.

‘I wish him the best on pipelines’

Notley said her team is “already getting down to work” as Opposition.

“We will hold the new government to account on pipelines, on jobs, on the economy, and on its promises that it would protect public services,” she said.

“Of course, I wish him the best on pipelines,” she added. “I will be watching very closely.”

Notley’s team includes numerous returning MLAs who were cabinet ministers in her government. It begs the question as to whether former ministers will take on the critic roles in their old portfolios. Former health minister Sarah Hoffman, former finance minister Joe Ceci, and former education minister David Eggen are among the high-profile NDP candidates to win seats.

“Albertans have elected a very strong and capable Opposition, made up of people with lots of experience both in the community as well as in the legislature,” she said. “I think we’re going to see a very robust, considered, well-informed debate.”

The UCP cabinet will be sworn in April 30, when Kenney said he’ll move into the premier’s office. He said a legislative session will launch in the third week of May.

He noted that there would be “some changes” to the public sector in terms of senior management, and in agencies, boards and commissions.

“We’ll be reviewing all of that, but it will be striking I hope the right balance,” he said, adding he wants to ensure there’s continuity.

Kenney’s made it clear his government’s first order of business will include proclaiming turn-off-the-taps legislation and bringing in a bill to repeal the NDP’s carbon tax.

He has also vowed to nix the 100-megatonne oilsands emissions cap under the NDP climate leadership plan.

Notley said Thursday that would be a mistake.

“I think it’s very likely that Ottawa will reconsider the pipeline if the emissions cap is eliminated,” she said.

Listen to our Canadian news podcast, 10/3
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., says the biggest mistake she's made in her first four months as a freshman congresswoman was how the rollout of the so-called Green New Deal — her ambitious environmental plan to combat climate change — was handled.

"It was done in a way that it was easy to hijack the narrative around it," Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with the Yahoo News podcast "Skullduggery" on Sunday. "It was too fast."

In February, Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., introduced the wide-ranging proposal at a news conference on Capitol Hill, where she called it a "first step" in defining an urgent environmental crisis facing the United States. Conservative critics, including President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, were quick to mock the plan and its 29-year-old champion.

Last month, the Green New Deal failed in the Senate after Republicans, led by McConnell, pushed for a vote.

Ocasio-Cortez called the resolution itself "very solid," but conceded that competing documents — including an erroneous FAQ — were rolled out prematurely and "muddied" the messaging surrounding it.

That allowed opponents to mischaracterize what's in the plan.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., announce the Green New Deal on Feb. 7. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) More

Trump falsely said the Green New Deal would "permanently eliminate" all planes and cars. (It would not. The proposal aims to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions "as much as technologically feasible.")

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, falsely suggested the proposal would "get rid of all cows." (It would not. According to Ocasio-Cortez, the plan would address the ills of factory farming.)

"None of those things are in there," she said. "It was just frustrating — intensely frustrating."

But the freshman congresswoman says she's learning from her mistakes.

"I feel like I'm fine-tuning," Ocasio-Cortez said. "So I'll have to dial things back a little bit to get that pressure closer to where I want it to be ... but I don't feel like there was anything major that it was like, I really wish I didn't do that."

Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, apparently provided the White House with information on the Russia investigation after a private briefing with then-FBI Director James Comey, according to special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report.

Within a week of Comey briefing the "Gang of Eight" congressional leaders about the FBI's Russia probe in March 2017, Mueller wrote that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn's office was in contact with the North Carolina Republican "and appears to have received information about the status of the FBI investigation."

As Mueller notes, it's unclear if Trump was aware of the briefing at the time. But Annie Donaldson, who served as McGahn's chief of staff, wrote then that "POTUS in panic/chaos ... Need binders to put in front of POTUS. (1) All things related to Russia."

According to Donaldson's notes, which Mueller referenced, McGahn's office was briefed by Burr "on the existence of '4-5 targets.'" It was not clear if Donaldson was present for that briefing, or was simply taking notes on something she had heard.

Those targets — listed in Donaldson's notes — were former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. Mueller said Donaldson's notes "track [with] the background materials prepared by the FBI for Comey's briefing to the Gang of 8 on March 9." In Comey's briefing, Mueller wrote that the then-FBI director included "an identification of the principal U.S. subjects of the investigation."

"Chairman Burr does not recall this specific conversation with Mr. McGahn in March of 2017; however, any conversations between the two would have been in reference to the need for White House personnel to voluntarily comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation," Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Burr, told NBC News in a statement. "If specific individuals were discussed, they would have been those known to the Committee, the White House, and the media. The Chairman’s stewardship over the Committee’s bipartisan and fact-based investigation over the last two years speaks for itself."

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and a member of the panel, said in a statement: "Given evidence from the Mueller report, the committee must take steps to ensure its investigations do not leak to the executive branch."
As the NFL continues to become more creative in its playcalling, offensive draft prospects who can do a bit of everything become more valuable to teams. One of the most versatile weapons this year is Alabama running back Josh Jacobs, who is projected to be the first running back off the board in the 2019 NFL Draft.

Jacobs produced everywhere for Alabama, whether it was standard handoffs, wildcat running plays, blocking, or receiving. He was able to perform as the Crimson Tide’s battering ram when they needed a yard or two, and he was a graceful receiver down the field when Alabama asked him to line up there.

There’s more that should excite NFL teams than just that, though. He can be a threat to throw the ball, and Julio Jones taught him about some of the intricacies of running routes. Jacobs broke it all down for SB Nation during the NFL Combine.

The wildcat is just one way Jacobs brings flexibility to an offense

When Alabama got into short-yardage situations, it liked to use Jacobs as a wildcat quarterback. As a former high school quarterback, Jacobs already had experience with taking direct snaps from the center.

Here’s an example of Jacobs as Alabama’s wildcat quarterback on a third-and-1 against Mississippi State last season. He gets the snap, finds a small crease, and then breaks a tackle for the first down.

There’s an inherent difficulty with running these plays because the defense pretty much knows that the offense is going to run the ball. Running backs typically don’t get a chance to throw the ball, which eliminates a lot of the guesswork for the defense.

“Everybody knows that 80 percent of the time it’s going to be a run,” Jacobs told SB Nation. “They’re expecting the run. The thought of the type of physicality you gotta have before the play, knowing that they’re probably going to blitz. That’s probably the biggest difference.”

This play from Alabama’s College Football Playoff National Championship loss against Clemson is a perfect example of what Jacobs was talking about. Clemson has six defenders on the line of scrimmage and the Tigers linebackers are flowing downhill hard toward the running back. It’s fourth-and-1 and Alabama is in its wildcat formation — there is no secret about what the Tide’s intentions are on the play.

Yet, Jacobs was able to convert the first down.

Jacobs never threw the ball at Alabama, but he did confirm those plays were drawn up for him, just in case.

“We actually had a lot of pass plays from that formation that we didn’t show,” Jacobs said. “As far as looking forward, I don’t know how that will work in the league, but we’ll see how it goes.”

Jacobs’ ability to pick up first downs and be a productive player when the defense knows what’s coming will serve him well in the NFL. The advanced stats supports how good he is at moving the chains as a runner as well.

According to SB Nation’s Bill Connelly, Jacobs had the highest success rate of the 27 draft-eligible running backs that he has data on this year. Jacobs had “successful” rushes on 56.6 percent of his carries, which is three percentage points higher than the next best back in the class.

One caveat with the data is Jacobs only ran the ball 251 times in college, but when he got the ball, he was producing plays that kept Alabama out of long down-and-distance situations.

Outside of Jacobs’ versatility as a running back and wildcat quarterback, he was an electric performer as a receiver as well.

Julio Jones helped mold Jacobs into a deadly receiving back

Jacobs’ ability to catch the ball really separates him from other backs in the class. Along with leading the 27 running backs in rushing success rate, he also finished second in the class in receiving success rate with a mark of 57.6 percent.

As a former high school quarterback, Jacobs had to learn how to run routes and catch the ball down the field on the fly in college. Jacobs credited current Atlanta Falcons wide receiver and former Alabama star Julio Jones with his development as a receiver.

“He comes back all the time, he works out with us,” Jacobs said about Jones. “He gives me tips on running routes, all of that.”

There’s no better teacher than arguably the best receiver in the NFL, who passed some of that knowledge down onto the Alabama’s star running back.

“Just learning how to stem. When a player gets on you and you stack him and you break off using you leverage and stuff like that. He basically taught me all of that,” Jacobs said.

Stacking a defender is when a receiver gets a step on the defender in coverage and runs in front of them, which shields the defender from making a play on the ball.

That skill was on display during a big catch in the Iron Bowl. Jacobs starts off in the backfield, runs directly at the linebacker that’s supposed to covering him, gets behind him, and then creates just enough space for the quarterback to find him down the field.

Jacobs can also make things happen out of the backfield as a receiver. One of his signature plays during his time at Alabama came in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Oklahoma.

This is just a simple route to the flat, which Oklahoma has vacated. Jacobs takes in the easy catch, picks up steam, and then demolishes and Oklahoma defender in the open field.

Obviously, it won’t be as easy to run over defensive backs in the NFL, but it shows that Jacobs can be an effective runner after the catch.

Jacobs did everything well for the Crimson Tide and his game should translate to the NFL. The big concern with Jacobs is he didn’t really touch that ball all that much in college, but it’s a little hard to gauge how that will affect him in the league.

In three seasons at Alabama, Jacobs only had 299 touches. For reference, his teammate Damien Harris had 319 touches in the last two seasons combined. However, Jacobs did become a bigger piece of Alabama’s offense as the season went on. Jacobs didn’t have more than nine carries in a game for the first seven games of the season, but had at least 10 carries in four of the last eight games.

Even with the increased workload, Jacobs still remained an efficient force for Alabama. No one in this draft class comes even close to matching his overall efficiency.

No matter how you value the position in today’s NFL, Jacobs is exactly what teams should be looking for in a running back.

Hong Kong (CNN Business) Weibo can't seem to get it right.

After apparently censoring a popular hashtag related to LGBT issues, the Chinese social networkrestored access Tuesday following a major backlash from users.

That backlash saw Weibo filled with rainbow flags, while related hashtags attracted millions of views and posts.

In many ways, it was a repeat of what happened last year, when Weibo launched a campaign to "clean up" the platform , including the removal of all gay-themed cartoons and videos — along with pornographic and violent material — to comply with Chinese laws and regulations.

The Twitter-like service, which boasts nearly 400 million active users, had to backtrack then too after an uproar from activists and ordinary users.

Both incidents show just how difficult it can be for even some of China's largest internet companies to toe the government's ever-moving line on what is permitted on the internet.

A spokesman for Weibo did not respond to CNN's request for comment for this article.

After Weibo banned the "super topic"( similar with tag) of "les(bian)"with 480 million hits and WeChat forbiddened using rainbow emoji in usernames, online protest is raising again this weekend. pic.twitter.com/KyIthaCqQI — 吕频Lü Pin (@pinerpiner) April 15, 2019

Great Firewall

While there are some hard and fast rules for what content is banned in China — pornography, separatism, terrorism, for example — for the most part companies are expected to regulate themselves. There is no comprehensive blacklist of sensitive topics, so companies, and their legions of censors, must second-guess whether individual posts or discussions are to be allowed, based on their interpretation of public pronouncements and campaigns.

"Due to the lack of transparency in censorship decisions by the Chinese government and Chinese social media companies, we won't be able to really know who was behind the censorship and then the reversal," Yaqiu Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch and expert on Chinese media, told CNN.

She said that a vague clause in the recently passed Cybersecurity Law , on respecting "social morality," may "have driven Weibo to censor LGBT content."

Woes of China censorship reporting: multiple mechanisms, lots of layers, lots of actors, opaque motives and topics move in and out of censors' attention... I'm still seeing lots of concern out there about renewed efforts targeting LGBT content. — Christian 马思潭 (@cdcshepherd) April 16, 2019

The general lack of certainty about what they're supposed to police often leads companies to err on the side of caution, fearing potentially ruinous punishments for failing to censor something they should have.

Last year, Quora-style question and answer service Zhiyu was removed from app stores for a week "due to lax supervision and the spread of illegal information," according to a leaked censorship directive . Other companies have faced major fines and suspensions in the past.

But taking the initiative on censorship can also get companies in trouble, as Weibo has learned twice now. While the Chinese government has stepped up restrictions on the country's LGBT community in recent months, there has been no official directive — yet — that anything to do with gay or lesbian issues should be censored.

This appears to have left Weibo stuck between its young, more liberal users, and the old, conservative men who run the Communist Party, unsure of who to please and running the risk of angering both.

Crackdown?

Weibo's brief censorship of LGBT content is not the first sign that official attitudes may be hardening.

Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the authorities removed it from the official list of mental disorders in 2001. But in recent years, the Communist government under President Xi Jinping has taken an increasingly hardline stance on LGBT rights, banning portrayal of same-sex relationships on television and online.

In March, most mentions of homosexuality were removed from "Bohemian Rhapsody," the award-winning biopic of British rock band Queen's frontman Freddie Mercury, prior to its release in China. Among the clips that were removed were scenes of men kissing and the word "gay" for the Chinese audience.

According to the South China Morning Post , several LGBT organizations, including the Guangzhou Gender and Sexuality Education Centre, have been shut down in recent months.

Speaking to the Financial Times before the Weibo ban was rolled back, a spokesman for the Beijing LGBT Centre predicted that "China's censorship of LGBT content will be ever more strict this year compared to last year."

Wang, the HRW researcher, saw two reasons for the government's apparent hostility to LGBT issues.

"The Communist Party wants to assert itself as the only moral authority in Chinese society and dictate ... what is not for the public to consume, often in the name of national security and social stability," she said.

The Chinese government considers independent civil society groups and organized protests as threats to its rule, Wang added.

"It certainly does not want to see China's LGBT community becoming more empowered through online organizing."

There’s a moment in the Super Metroid finale, somewhere in between being brain-blasted by a creature that looks like it escaped from Attack on Titan and being saved by a flying alien parasite, that the whole nature of the battle is suddenly revealed to be entirely scripted. The idea of scripted battles, an idea that was still incredibly new back in the 16-bit era of the SNES, made for something of a rarity in the mid-’90s.

Strangely, director Yoshio Sakamoto not only chose to include a scripted battle sequence in Super Metroid, the third entry in one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises, he actually made it the focal point of the entire finale. Stranger still, it worked. Fast forward 20 years and SM‘s final battle remains the most memorable and iconic moment in the history of the Metroid series, and it isn’t hard to see why.

Beginning as a direct callback to the original Metroid title for the NES, the battle is outset by a 16-bit re-imagining of that game’s finale. Series protagonist Samus Aran treks deep beneath the surface of the alien planet Zebes to put an end to the nefarious Mother Brain once and for all. Never one for falsely cryptic names, Mother Brain is literally a giant brain in a jar and is mainly protected by machines, with no real attack capability of her own.

The first bit of the battle goes by in a blink, with the player simply blasting away at Mother Brain using missiles and super missiles, but after the life support machine for this massive wad of grey matter is decimated, the battle takes a pretty dramatic left turn. Out of nowhere the shattered and broken brain rears up onto a giant cybernetic body, Mother Brain rattles out a terrifying screech, the music takes on a note of inevitable cataclysm, and the real fight begins. Except…not really.

THe BATTLE WITH MOTHER BRAIN IS A MASTER CLASS IN WORDLESS STORY-TELLING

As mentioned above, this entire battle is almost entirely scripted, and, as such, it’s nearly impossible to come out on the losing end of it. But a first-time player has no idea that this is the case, and it isn’t until you replay the battle a few times that you begin to see the strings.

Mother Brain shows off 4 attacks in her new H.R. Giger worthy form: a glowing ring projectile, a timed bomb attack, a fiery energy burst, and, of course, the devastating brain blast. This last bit hits like the Hulk on steroids, draining off an alarming 3-4 energy tanks of a possible 14. The first time it comes out, most players will be picking their jaw up off the floor while they regain their composure, totally unaware that this is all part of an automatic sequence of events.

As this tumultuous attack drains the player’s life force in less than a minute flat, Samus soon becomes an inert object, literally brought to her knees as she is forced to wait for the inevitable end. Making this last moment even more effective is the fact that the player retains partial control of Samus, allowing them to make her stand, but never allowing them to move her as this horrifying brain on stilts powers up to crush her for good.

Then, just as the grim reaper is wrapping his skeletal claws around Samus’ ankle, her death sentence is suddenly relieved by the most dangerous creature in the galaxy, a metroid. To rewind, in the previous installment, Metroid II: Return of Samus, our heroine was tasked with destroying the remainder of this dangerous species on its homeworld, SR-388. However, in the end, Samus spares a single baby, who then takes to her as if she were its mother.

It is precisely this creature, now mega-sized who comes to her aid, draining Mother Brain of her life force in a dramatic display of power. But alas, Mother Brain cannot be felled so easily, and as the metroid shields you with its own body, restoring your health and mobility, she reengages her assault. As the metroid takes hit after hit, it only thinks to attack again once it is certain you are safe but by then it’s already too late–Mother Brain crushes it with a final glowing ring, and the metroid falls to the ground with a cry of distress.

It’s a heart-rending moment, something akin to watching your dog get shot after it has just saved your life. For many gamers, it was not the timeless tale of Old Yeller that signaled the death of childhood and taught them about the cruelties of the world, but the demise of a nameless space parasite. Only with this emotional gravitas initiated is the last leg of this battle finally ready to begin.

The music changes again, becoming a triumphant and rippling theme of justice. Invincible with rage and grief, Samus is a force to be reckoned with and can put Mother Brain down for the count in a matter of a few dozen seconds. A new hyper-beam attack, available only for this brief period, clinches this last encounter even as it begins, and before the player can even wipe away their tears, Mother Brain is no more.

This battle with Mother Brain is a master class in wordless story-telling, and it never removes you from the experience. At no point during this encounter does the player realize that they are simply being pushed along a conveyor belt toward the credits sequence, a massive testament to how seamless and enmeshed the finale is in the gameplay and engine that powers Super Metroid from start to finish.

It was the death of a thousand childhoods, and a finale that will no doubt live on in perpetuity for as long as the medium itself is in existence.
Of course, you’ll remember Rep. Rashida Tlaib as the newly elected congresswoman who shouted at a party, “We’re gonna impeach the motherf***er,” so we can assure you she does take pleasure in introducing an impeachment resolution against President Trump, who was shown after a two-year, $25 million investigation not to have colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.

Her sister in Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, says she takes no pleasure in impeachment proceedings, but the duty just fell into her lap on the release of the Mueller report.

Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib’s impeachment resolution. https://t.co/CgPZJiULOL — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 18, 2019

While I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 18, 2019

Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, & rarely discuss it unprompted. We all prefer working on our priorities: pushing Medicare for All, tackling student loans, & a Green New Deal. But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 18, 2019

That’s quite a heavy burden: Congress is going to have to determine what crime, exactly, was the subject of the president’s obstruction of justice.

But let’s not even pretend this is a new or serious thing; does AOC even know how many impeachment resolutions have been introduced already? Rep. Brad Sherman (who?) introduced his articles of impeachment at noon the first day Democrats took back control of the House.

“Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment” — yeah, right. That explains the split in the party between establishment Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer who think impeachment is a waste of time that could be spent on winning 2020 and young progressives who were elected on the promise of impeaching Trump.

Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff both admit they can't impeach Trump so they won't even try. It's only complete morons like AOC and her band of freshman buffoons who keep dreaming. hahaha — Mark Dice (@MarkDice) April 18, 2019

New York City approved a sweeping climate legislation package Thursday that is being compared to the Green New Deal.

In a 45-2 vote, the city legislature passed the Climate Mobilization Act, which aims to enact the largest carbon reduction measures of any city globally.

At the heart of the package is a bill that would require New York’s largest residential and commercial buildings to reduce carbon emissions 40 percent by 2040 and 80 percent by 2050. In comparison, the Green New Deal resolution introduced in Congress aims to get the U.S. electric grid running on 100 percent green energy by 2030.

The NYC bill’s requirements focus on buildings over 25,000 square feet, which represent just 2 percent of New York’s real estate yet account for about half of emissions from all buildings in the city. Overall, 70 percent of emissions in the city come from buildings.

Buildings that would be bound to the new emissions regulations include One World Trade Center and Trump Tower.

A report by the environmentalist group, Climate Works for all Coalition, ranked the Trump Tower as the fourth biggest energy user amongst all buildings in New York City.

Other measures included in the comprehensive climate package include requirements for certain structures to build green roofs or be equipped with solar panels, measures to ease the construction of wind projects, and a requirement for the city to study how to shut down its 24 utility-scale power plants to be replaced with renewable energy sources and storage.

Supporters claim the bill would produce 40,000 new jobs, of which nearly 25,000 would be in construction.

“I am proud to be a co-sponsor of Introduction 1253 as it sets ambitious, comprehensive standards on New York City’s worst polluters, old buildings. By modernizing buildings to raise efficiency standards we will dramatically cut pollution long term,” said Council Member Ben Kallos, in a statement.

“Retrofitting for efficiency and sustainability will reduce our City’s carbon footprint and create thousands of much-needed, good paying jobs.”

The bill now awaits NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio's (D) signature.
A road rage incident could have been a lot worse if two deputies with the Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office hadn’t been stuck in traffic right where a fight was about to break out.

Traffic slowed to a crawl as they traveled in an unmarked car towards Englewood. In fact, it had slowed so much, four men had time to get out of their cars for an altercation.

“Driving can be stressful, but feeling angry when behind the wheel could lead to aggressive driving, distracted driving or even an accident,” deputies wrote in a department-issued a press release.

When they saw the men on the road, they turned on their emergency lights and pulled up right behind them.

As soon as the deputies approached, three of the men began yelling, “He’s got a knife! He’s got a machete,” while pointing at 38-year-old Michael Cittadino.

According to a press release, deputies didn’t see any weapons in Cittadino’s possession, but his mannerisms were aggressive. They said he clinched his fists and ignored commands to show his hands, at times even reaching into his pockets.

Finally, detectives sprang into action. They grabbed the suspect’s wrist. Try as he might, Cittadino couldn’t snatch his way to freedom.

Investigators took statements from the other three men. One of them said he was trying to merge lanes in front of Cittadino, but the suspect blocked the lane.

That’s when the suspect allegedly pulled out a machete and went to town on the victim’s car. Deputies said they could see the damage Cittadino left on the victim’s windshield.

The other two men are the victim's coworkers. They just happened to see their colleague in trouble and went to his defense.

They told authorities the suspect threw the machete back inside his car.

Cittadino reported back pain during his arrest. Deputies transported him to a hospital for evaluation, then to the county jail where he faces aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, criminal mischief and resisting an officer without violence charges.

The suspect’s car was impounded as investigators pursued a warrant to search it. Once they got it, they found a machete inside.

Ajay Devgn photographed at an event in Mumbai.

Highlights "I am extremely sensitive to the #MeToo movement," said Ajay Ajay faced criticism from Tanushree Dutta and Vinta Nanda Alok Nath was called out as sexual predator in October last year

Ajay Devgn is learning the hard way that promises made on a public forum - in this case, social media - are not to be taken lightly. six months after he pledged in a tweet never to work with #MeToo accused, Mr Devgn is being called out for co-starring with actor Alok Nath, who was outed as an alleged sexual predator by TV producer Vinta Nanda last year. Now, after being roundly slammed for not sticking by his promise, Ajay Devgn has defended himself in a statement, claiming 'circumstances were beyond his control' and that he was being unfairly 'singled out.' Alok Nath has been cast with Ajay Devgn in an upcoming film called De De Pyar De.

I'm disturbed by all the happenings with regards to #MeToo. My company and I believe in providing women with utmost respect and safety. If anyone has wronged even a single woman, neither ADF nor I will stand for it. — Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) October 12, 2018

In his statement, Ajay Devgn says: "Coming to the question of having worked with Mr Alok Nath in my upcoming film De De Pyar De, here I must put certain things in perspective. reiterate I am extremely sensitive to the #MeToo movement. But when circumstances are beyond me, I don't see why an attempt is being made to 'single' me out as being insensitive. This is untrue."

Mr Devgn, 50, claimed in his statement that logistics did not allow Alok Nath's part to be recast. His statement reads: "The portions with Mr Alok Nath were canned by August in Manali. The said portions were shot over 40 days across various sets and an outdoor location with a combination of over 10 actors. By the time the allegations came out (in October 2018) the actors in the film including me had already started work on other films."

Ajay Devgn also claimed that replacing Alok Nath in the film would have been a unanimous decision and that it wouldn't have been up to just him: "It would also have been a huge monetary loss for the producers. Everyone is aware that film-making is a collaborative process. The decision to replace Mr Alok Nath could never have been mine alone. In this case, I would have to go with the joint-decision of the entire unit," read his statement.

Ajay Devgn's statement comes a day after Tanushree Dutta, who is credited with starting the MeToo Movement in India, released a statement, in which she criticised the actor for casting Alok Nath, who was accused last year of having raped, harassed and intimidated Vinta Nanda several years ago. "Tinsel town is full of liars, show-offs and spineless hypocrites. And it seems by a large public consensus that the sign post is pointing currently at Ajay Devgn," read an excerpt from Ms Dutta's statement.

Vinta Nanda herself seemed more resigned to the inevitability of Mr Devgn going back on his word, telling mid-day: 'I don't expect anything from Ajay Devgn. I don't think he is in any position to take a stand. The money riding on the project is the only dharma for them."

When Ajay Devgn was asked about Mr Nath's casting in the film during the trailer launch of De De Pyaar De, the actor neatly dodged the question, saying: "This is not the right place to talk about it. And jinki aap baat kar rahe hai woh film uske pehle complete hui (the film was completed before the allegations surfaced against the concerned person)," news agency PTI reported.

De De Pyaar De is a romantic comedy directed by Akiv Ali and produced by Luv Ranjan. The film also stars Tabu and Rakul Preet Singh. The film is slated to release on May 17.

HalfSpaces Player Analysis,usmnt Under the Microscope: Tyler Boyd

Under the Microscope: Tyler Boyd

Ben

Tyler Boyd is a name that has gained some traction in USMNT circles lately. He’s scored several goals for Ankaragucu (I can’t believe I know how to spell that now) and even did an interview with Brian Sciaretta a couple months back.

But let’s be honest here. Have you ever seen him play? I know I haven’t. He falls into that mythical creature category of US-eligible players with Jordan Siebatcheu, Brendan Hines-Ike, and a couple others. He exists. The Twitter-verse has strong opinions on him. But I would venture to say that very few people have seen him play.

These players are all on Fenerbahce: Roberto Soldado, Mathieu Valbuena, Victor Moses, Martin Skrtel, Islam Slimani, and Andre Ayew. Crazy, right?

To be completely honest (before this) I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a Turkish Super Lig game. I know a little bit about the league, I mean, I’ve played FIFA. Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas are the good teams and everyone else has an unpronounceable name. There’s usually a couple guys on one of those teams where your like…Robinho plays there? I thought he was dead. And hey! He’s still pretty good.

Anyway, that’s probably way too long a preamble, but I was able to do some deep Google work and track down an entire game that Tyler Boyd played against Fenerbahce. I thought it would be a good game to watch because I know he scores and Fenerbahce is one of the big boys of Turkish soccer (although they are 14th out of 18 teams rn. What’s up with that?)

As usual, as much as possible, I focused only on Boyd. He was #30 playing left wing/midfield. The strengths and weaknesses noted below are based on this one game. I’m aware that’s not ideal, but I have this annoying job thing that prevents me from watching soccer full time.

UNRELATED NOTE: The Turkish Super Lig felt very CONCACAF-y. There were two red cards, the refs were blowing calls, and the crowd was awesome. Good times.

Team Context

Ankaragucu is 13th out of 18 teams in the Super Lig and was thoroughly outclassed in this game. They were set up in a 4-4-2 block on defense and Boyd was the left midfielder of that midfield 4 in defense.

On offense (there wasn’t a lot of it for Ankaragucu), Boyd would get up the field quickly and played as a pinched in winger. He definitely didn’t get much chalk on his cleats, so to speak. Whether that’s his natural inclination or coaches instruction I couldn’t say from this one game.

Positives

Speed

Boyd is fast and active. He doesn’t do a lot of standing around and he makes decisive runs. Once the ball turned over in this game…he took off.

Look at him open up space between him and the defender with this run. He looks good at recognizing the right moments to get on his horse.

This is Boyd’s goal. He recognizes very quickly that his teammate has won the ball in midfield and goes. One of my main complaints with Arriola/Baird as the US’ wingers is their lack of pace. Boyd flies down the field and the defenders have no shot at catching him. The US has been a slow team for a while now. Speed is important.

When was the last time the USMNT had a player that could threaten to take the top off a defense (to steal an American football phrase)? Donovan? Charlie Davies? It’s been a while and I think Boyd might provide that threat.

Two-footed

If you paid attention to the goal highlight you’ll note that Boyd scored with his left foot. He’s actually right footed and good enough with it that he took several of his team’s set pieces. See below.

The USMNT could use a good set piece taker. IIRC Pulisic did that job in March and it wasn’t great. Early in the game he played a couple passes with his left foot and was stationed on the left wing so I checked Transfermarkt to see which was his dominant foot. In my world, if I have to check to see which foot is your better one…that’s a good sign.

Feisty

My favorite thing about Arriola is his attitude. Dude just fights for it. There used to be a hockey player named Pat Verbeek who’s nickname was “the Little Ball of Hate” (great nickname) and Arriola is made of a similar material.

Boyd has some of that in his game. He didn’t win every ball, but it certainly wasn’t for lack of effort or half-hearted challenges.

He loses the battle here, but there’s a nice first touch to chest the ball past the defender and I like the fight he shows trying to keep the ball.

Though feisty, it also appears Boyd’s not an idiot. There was some unpleasantness and two red cards toward the end of this game. Boyd pulled the old veteran maneuver of standing around the edges handling one of the calmer combatants. 😂

Defense

Tbh, I’m not completely sure if this is a positive, but I don’t think it’s a negative. That being the case I’ll just put my notes on his defense here in the “Positives” section of things.

Here’s a few notable clips of Boyd playing defense:

Here he is a little slow to track a runner and Ankaragucu should have given up penalty as a result. Not quite sure how that’s not a handball.

In this clip Boyd closes down, stays in control and forces a sideways pass. Nothing crazy, but competent defending.

It appeared that Boyd’s defensive job for Ankaragucu was to stay off a little bit so you don’t get beat and make them pass inside. Here he does that job admirably.

Another defensive clip. It looks like Boyd loses his runner for a second, but is able to recover and knock the cross out of bounds.

Room to Improve

Passing (maybe decision making?)

As I said earlier, Ankaragucu didn’t have much of the ball, but there were two times where Boyd had the ball in threatening positions and the pass he chose in both situations didn’t create anything.

This is a quick break after a corner. Boyd does well to take the ball down, but then shoots/crosses (?) when it looks like dropping it back to a teammate was the better option.

This is towards the end of the game and Ankaragucu has a chance to get out on the break. At the very least, Boyd could have played the ball backwards and kept possession, but he plays this aimless looking ball forward and Fenerbahce is back on the offensive again.

Pass to nowhere on the break.

Conclusions

So is Tyler Boyd the answer to our prayers at winger? Probably not. Does he deserve a call up to see if he’s better than our current options (whispers – he’s better than everyone in the last camp other than maybe Arriola)? Absolutely. These are the type of players that seem to get the short end of the stick from US Soccer.

The middling Euro leagues are still better than MLS, but the federation/coaches seem to think otherwise. Players like Tyler Boyd should be getting called in to get a shot over people like Baird or Jonathan Lewis who isn’t even starting for his MLS team.

Berhalter has only had one full international camp, so let’s not get too upset yet, but if Boyd and players like him don’t start getting call ups…it may be time to be concerned.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler has a tightrope to walk. Zach Gibson/Getty Images

Robert Mueller’s report, which details 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump, is unsurprisingly meatier than Attorney General William Barr let on in his initial summary. As my colleague Mark Joseph Stern writes, it can even be read as an impeachment referral to Congress. House Democrats certainly welcomed it as such.

“The Special Counsel made clear that he did not exonerate the President,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a Thursday statement. “The responsibility now falls to Congress to hold the President accountable for his actions.” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, similarly, said in a statement that “the Special Counsel concludes that Congress must make a determination regarding obstruction of justice, unable to make such a determination himself.”

But then later, speaking on CNN, Hoyer appeared to put impeachment—Congress’ constitutional remedy for “high crimes and misdemeanors”—off the table.

“Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” he said. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months, and the American people will make a judgment.” Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed a similar point to the network: “A failed impeachment is not in the national interest.”

It’s a bit awkward: We’ll hold the president accountable but not in the way you’re thinking. Democrats may be welcoming the investigative responsibility they believe that Mueller, handcuffed by internal Justice Department policy forbidding the indictment of a sitting president, left in their laps. But even should they find strong bases for presidential obstruction, Democratic leaders are still loath to say they would initiate the formal response that would seem to naturally follow. House Democrats could—hell, are even likely to—find themselves following Mueller’s roadmap to the very end, but stopping just before the finish line out of a sense of political impracticality. It’s not a comfortable position to be in.

As Barr reemphasized in his Thursday morning press conference, he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, responded to Mueller’s punt on obstruction by taking it upon themselves to determine Trump had not committed such a crime.

The redacted release, however, makes clear that Mueller’s team had operated from the position that it would not make a “traditional prosecutorial decision.” Meaning even from the get-go the team decided “not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes,” even without an indictment, because “no charges can be brought.” The investigation’s stated goal, instead, was to “preserve the evidence,” and a “federal criminal accusation” could “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct”—a constitutional process like, oh, let’s say, impeachment.

Mueller also outlines several instances—asking White House counsel Don McGahn to lie, floating pardons and whispering other sweet nothings to witnesses—in which there’s a reasonable inference that the president obstructed justice, while very carefully not saying any such thing.

Now what if the House Judiciary Committee takes those reasonable inferences of obstruction and certifies them as proper instances of such? What would the repercussions be then?

When asked about impeachment at a Thursday afternoon press conference, Nadler said, “That’s one possibility.” He added that “there are others,” though didn’t expand much further.

That may be because once you look a couple of steps above Nadler’s pay grade, you find that impeachment isn’t much of a possibility. It’s not just Hoyer. Consider one of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s clearly defined criteria for pursuing impeachment: Republican buy-in. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” she told the Washington Post in March, “I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it.”

Republicans have unsurprisingly yet to see anything “compelling and overwhelming” enough to persuade them that they should toss their leader out of office. “Democrats want to keep searching for imaginary evidence that supports their claims, but it is simply not there,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Thursday. “IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, stated that “Democrats’ accusations of criminal obstruction are unfounded.”

“I look forward to examining the mountain of factions supporting the principal conclusions the attorney general and deputy attorney general shared last month: no collusion, no obstruction,” Collins added.

With Republicans making the shocking decision to stand by their president in the face of a not-very-friendly report, Democrats find themselves careening toward an impossible spot.

The Mueller report will give them solid grounds for making the case that Trump obstructed justice, a presidential misdeed for which there is constitutional remedy. But a remedy that the hapless pursuit of which would completely distract from election-cycle contrasts that swing voters care much more about, like protections for preexisting medical conditions. House Democratic leaders want Trump to carry the stench of well-documented impeachable offenses into election season, without actually having to do the impeachment. It’s not the biggest needle to thread.

HalfSpaces Player Analysis,usmnt Under the Microscope: Tyler Boyd

Under the Microscope: Tyler Boyd

Ben

Tyler Boyd is a name that has gained some traction in USMNT circles lately. He’s scored several goals for Ankaragucu (I can’t believe I know how to spell that now) and even did an interview with Brian Sciaretta a couple months back.

But let’s be honest here. Have you ever seen him play? I know I haven’t. He falls into that mythical creature category of US-eligible players with Jordan Siebatcheu, Brendan Hines-Ike, and a couple others. He exists. The Twitter-verse has strong opinions on him. But I would venture to say that very few people have seen him play.

These players are all on Fenerbahce: Roberto Soldado, Mathieu Valbuena, Victor Moses, Martin Skrtel, Islam Slimani, and Andre Ayew. Crazy, right?

To be completely honest (before this) I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a Turkish Super Lig game. I know a little bit about the league, I mean, I’ve played FIFA. Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas are the good teams and everyone else has an unpronounceable name. There’s usually a couple guys on one of those teams where your like…Robinho plays there? I thought he was dead. And hey! He’s still pretty good.

Anyway, that’s probably way too long a preamble, but I was able to do some deep Google work and track down an entire game that Tyler Boyd played against Fenerbahce. I thought it would be a good game to watch because I know he scores and Fenerbahce is one of the big boys of Turkish soccer (although they are 14th out of 18 teams rn. What’s up with that?)

As usual, as much as possible, I focused only on Boyd. He was #30 playing left wing/midfield. The strengths and weaknesses noted below are based on this one game. I’m aware that’s not ideal, but I have this annoying job thing that prevents me from watching soccer full time.

UNRELATED NOTE: The Turkish Super Lig felt very CONCACAF-y. There were two red cards, the refs were blowing calls, and the crowd was awesome. Good times.

Team Context

Ankaragucu is 13th out of 18 teams in the Super Lig and was thoroughly outclassed in this game. They were set up in a 4-4-2 block on defense and Boyd was the left midfielder of that midfield 4 in defense.

On offense (there wasn’t a lot of it for Ankaragucu), Boyd would get up the field quickly and played as a pinched in winger. He definitely didn’t get much chalk on his cleats, so to speak. Whether that’s his natural inclination or coaches instruction I couldn’t say from this one game.

Positives

Speed

Boyd is fast and active. He doesn’t do a lot of standing around and he makes decisive runs. Once the ball turned over in this game…he took off.

Look at him open up space between him and the defender with this run. He looks good at recognizing the right moments to get on his horse.

This is Boyd’s goal. He recognizes very quickly that his teammate has won the ball in midfield and goes. One of my main complaints with Arriola/Baird as the US’ wingers is their lack of pace. Boyd flies down the field and the defenders have no shot at catching him. The US has been a slow team for a while now. Speed is important.

When was the last time the USMNT had a player that could threaten to take the top off a defense (to steal an American football phrase)? Donovan? Charlie Davies? It’s been a while and I think Boyd might provide that threat.

Two-footed

If you paid attention to the goal highlight you’ll note that Boyd scored with his left foot. He’s actually right footed and good enough with it that he took several of his team’s set pieces. See below.

The USMNT could use a good set piece taker. IIRC Pulisic did that job in March and it wasn’t great. Early in the game he played a couple passes with his left foot and was stationed on the left wing so I checked Transfermarkt to see which was his dominant foot. In my world, if I have to check to see which foot is your better one…that’s a good sign.

Feisty

My favorite thing about Arriola is his attitude. Dude just fights for it. There used to be a hockey player named Pat Verbeek who’s nickname was “the Little Ball of Hate” (great nickname) and Arriola is made of a similar material.

Boyd has some of that in his game. He didn’t win every ball, but it certainly wasn’t for lack of effort or half-hearted challenges.

WASHINGTON (AP) — To Donald Trump, the start of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation looked alarmingly like the end of his presidency. So he tried to stop it.

His months-long effort pushed the boundaries of presidential powers and the law, revealing a commander in chief consumed by self-interest and intent on having his top lieutenants lie or obfuscate on his behalf. The fact that many refused to do so may have helped save Trump from being charged with obstructing justice.

Those advisers effectively served as the guardrails in a White House that often seems to have none. A White House counsel who told the president he would rather resign than oust Mueller. A senior West Wing aide who quietly ignored a request to pass messages to the attorney general, who had already recused himself from the investigation.

“The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the president sought to use his official power outside of usual channels,” Mueller wrote in his redacted 448-page report.

The episodes detailed by the special counsel paint a damning portrait of a president consumed by the investigation. Even after more than two years of revelations about Trump’s willingness to lie or press others to do so, Mueller’s report put into sharp focus the president’s disregard for governing norms and his willingness to challenge both legal and political limits.

Trump and his advisers can herald the fact that two years of investigation ended without criminal charges for the president, not only on obstruction but also on criminal conspiracy with Russia to help him win the 2016 election. Though numerous people with ties to Trump — including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort — did plead guilty to crimes, no Americans were indicted for colluding with Moscow.

“His greatest rebuttal will be he’s in office, he’s going to remain in office and he’ll get re-elected because the Democrats have nothing,” Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said of the president.

Indeed, the Democrats’ next steps are unclear. Some lawmakers will likely continue to press for impeachment proceedings, though party leaders are skeptical of that approach. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has requested that Mueller testify before his committee within weeks and plans to subpoena for the full report and underlying evidence.

Yet the end of Mueller’s investigation did more than answer questions about whether Trump and his associates committed crimes. The probe underscored just how far Trump has gone in pushing the limits of the presidency and encouraging others to help him do so.

Rep. Adam Schiff, Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, said that while Trump’s actions may not have been criminal, they were “dishonest, unethical, immoral and unpatriotic.”

Trump’s actions were in line with his behavior as a businessman, when he employed a team of lawyers and fixers to protect him from legal trouble. One of those longtime confidants, lawyer Michael Cohen, was brought down in an investigation stemming from Mueller’s probe, centering on hush money payments he made during the 2016 campaign to women who alleged sexual relationships with Trump.

In other facets of his administration, Trump has also pressed legal bounds. He has repeatedly directed immigration advisers to take actions they deemed illegal, including blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. When it became clear in recent weeks that those advisers would not follow his orders, he ordered an overhaul of the top echelons of the Department of Homeland Security.

There were clear echoes of that behavior throughout Mueller’s report.

The most startling episode came in June 2017, when Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the probe, and say that Mueller must be ousted because he had conflicts of interest. McGahn refused — deciding he would rather resign than trigger a potential constitutional crisis.

Two days later, the president tried another avenue to alter the investigation. During a meeting with former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, he dictated a message for Lewandowski to relay to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Though Sessions had already recused himself from the investigation, Trump was ordering him to publicly call the probe “very unfair” to the president, declare Trump did nothing wrong and say that Mueller should limit his probe to “investigating election meddling for future elections.”

Lewandowski didn’t want to deliver the message, according to Mueller, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to do so. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the request, Mueller writes, and did not follow through.

Most of the advisers who blocked Trump’s requests have since left his administration.

A faith-based adoption agency sued the state of Michigan on Monday, challenging a settlement that prevents the agency from refusing to put children in LGBTQ homes for religious reasons.

The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed the lawsuit in western Michigan's U.S. District Court on behalf of Lansing-based St. Vincent Catholic Charities. It is among more than 90 agencies receiving state funding to help place children from troubled homes with new families, according to the complaint.

"The state's decision to exclude certain agencies and certain very successful agencies like St. Vincent simply because of their religious beliefs causes unnecessary harm to the countless kids they're serving now and could be serving in the future merely because the attorney general doesn't like what St. Vincent believes and has believed for over 75 years," said Nick Reaves, a lawyer with Washington-based Becket.

The lawsuit also names Democratic state Attorney General Dana Nessel, the federal Department of Health and Human Services and other government officials. Also suing are two adoptive parents and a former foster child who was adopted.

The suit alleges violations of the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It was brought less than a month after the legal agreement was announced by Nessel and the American Civil Liberties of Michigan, which sued the state in 2017 on behalf of two lesbian couples who alleged they had been turned away because they are gay. Nessel has said such discrimination is illegal.

Spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said Monday that Nessel had not yet reviewed the complaint, but it appears the plaintiffs' attorneys do not understand the settlement agreement.

"Upon accepting a referral ... the law does not provide an agency with discretion to refuse to provide the accepted child or individual with state-contracted foster care case management or adoption services that conflict with its sincerely held religious beliefs," she said.

A 2015 Republican-enacted law says child-placement agencies are not required to provide any services that conflict with their sincerely held religious beliefs. But the settlement says the law does not apply if agencies are under contract with the state — a determination challenged by those suing.

"The state's new interpretation is certainly inconsistent with the legislative purpose and the language at the beginning of the law as well, which talks specifically about the important role that faith-based agencies play in caring from children in need in Michigan," Reaves said.

The U.S. government is named as a defendant, he said, because Nessel relied in part on federal regulations to say the state cannot allow religious exemptions from allegedly applicable anti-discrimination laws, and "some clarity" is needed on the Trump administration's position.

As of February, Bethany Christian Services, Catholic Charities and St. Vincent were responsible for more than 1,600, or 12 percent, of the state's 13,000-plus foster care and adoption cases. Faith-based agencies have said they will shut down their adoption and foster care services rather than violate their religious beliefs.

One of the plaintiffs in the new suit, Melissa Buck of Holt, near Lansing, said St. Vincent helped her and her husband, Chad, adopt five special needs children who were in the state's foster care system — "saving them from physical abuse, hunger and neglect." She said other children "won't be as lucky" if faith-based agencies are forced to close.

Democrats, LGBTQ advocates and liberal groups have applauded the settlement for ending a "policy of bigotry."

After taking office in January, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a directive to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ people by state government, contractors and others. It superseded an order that former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder signed and, unlike his, does not provide an exemption for religious organizations.

Presidente do tribunal considerou extinta decisão que impedia o ex-presidente de falar com a imprensa de dentro da prisão

As reviravoltas no Supremo Tribunal Federal impactaram o veto a Lula. Na tarde desta quinta-feira 18, o presidente Dias Toffoli extinguiu a decisão que impedia o ex-presidente de dar entrevistas na prisão.

Em setembro passado, a colunista Monica Bergamo e outros jornalistas pediram autorização para falar com ele dentro da sede da Polícia Federal em Curitiba. Mas os pedidos foram vetados pelo ministro Luiz Fux, que cassou uma liminar favorável dada antes por Ricardo Lewandowski. Fux determinou ainda que, se a entrevista já tivesse sido realizada, sua divulgação estaria censurada previamente.

Horas antes, ainda nesta quinta, o ministro Alexandre de Moraes havia derrubado a censura imposta por ele mesmo a uma reportagem da revista Crusoé que trazia mensagens em que Marcelo Odebrecht chama o ministro Dias Toffoli, presidente do Supremo, de “amigo do amigo de meu pai”. Na época, Toffoli era advogado-geral da União.

Em setembro do ano passado, o ministro Luiz Fux suspendeu uma liminar concedida por Ricardo Lewandowski que autorizava a Folha a entrevistar Lula na prisão, em Curitiba.

​

Fux não apenas cassou a permissão como disse, em sua decisão, que, se a entrevista já tivesse sido realizada, sua divulgação estaria censurada, estabelecendo uma censura prévia que é expressamente proibida pela Constituição.
For over a century, fossil fuels have been more than just the world's primary energy source; they've been a bedrock of the global financial system, an engine of economic growth and a safe investment for governments, pension funds, charitable endowments and other institutions around the world. If we hope to stop climate change before its effects become catastrophic, that will inevitably have to change — and many climate activists want it to change as soon as possible.

“Public money is being invested in companies that are directly contributing to climate change,” says Deborah McNamara, an activist with the Colorado Coalition for a Livable Climate, which includes more than two dozen environmental and social-justice groups from around the state. “Here in Colorado, money is being invested in fracking companies. Do we want our public money being invested in these companies that are polluting our air and water?”

After years of disappointment, the “Fossil Free” investing movement has picked up steam around the world and in Colorado, where — despite opposition from the state's powerful oil and gas industry — it’s won some small victories, including an announcement last month that the City and County of Denver plans to dump its investments in fossil fuel companies.

Globally, activists say, they’ve secured divestment commitments from more than 1,000 public and private institutions in dozens of countries, representing $8.7 trillion in managed assets. Last year, New York City announced plans to begin divesting its $200 billion pension system from fossil fuels within the next five years, by far the largest public divestment pledge yet made in the U.S.

But global financial markets change slowly, and short-term incentives still largely favor continued fossil fuel development and investment in the companies that profit from it. By and large, there remains a lack of political will for divestment on the massive scale that some environmental groups believe is urgently needed — a reality that Colorado divestment activists once again encountered earlier this week.

After an hour-long hearing at the State Capitol on Monday, April 8, lawmakers on the House Finance Committee voted overwhelmingly to defeat House Bill 1270, a proposal to require the state’s pension system to simply study the risks of its fossil fuel investments.

The two-page bill would have directed the Public Employees Retirement Association, which manages the pensions of half a million current and former state employees, to hire an independent firm to assess its portfolio’s “climate-related financial risk.” PERA’s leadership opposed the legislation, claiming that its own internal policies and procedures are enough to properly assess those risks, and six Democrats on the committee agreed, joining Republicans in killing the bill on a 10-1 vote.

“It’s a shame,” says McNamara, who testified in support of the bill. “The study would’ve allowed PERA to be on the leading edge in the U.S. in terms of pension funds considering climate risk in a more robust way. What I walk away with is the feeling that PERA is choosing the status quo.”

Like previous movements to discourage investment in Big Tobacco or apartheid South Africa, many advocates for fossil fuel divestment object to supporting oil, gas and coal development on moral grounds. The burning of fossil fuels is warming the climate to the point of global catastrophe, and they argue that it’s unethical for public institutions like PERA to continue to fund the industry.

But an important difference between campaigns like Fossil Free PERA and other divestment efforts is that when it comes to fossil fuels, there’s increasingly a financial argument to be made for divestment, too. As the world continues to transition away from fossil fuels in the coming decades, investments in oil and gas are at risk of becoming “stranded assets,” suffering sharp declines in value that leave institutional investors like pension funds on the hook for billions, or even trillions, in losses.

“If you look at what happened to coal in the last decade, those assets have done incredibly poorly,” says Dan Carreno, an analyst with Change Finance, a sustainability-focused investment firm. “We’re starting to see the exact same thing happen with natural gas, relative to wind and solar. And we could see the same thing happen with oil.”

"I talk to PERA members who say, 'I'm going to retire in the year 2035,' or 2050," says McNamara. "And these are the key benchmark years when it comes to what the IPCC has been telling us about climate change. So they want to make sure PERA is doing something now, so that by the time they are retiring, they're not dealing with the fallout from the climate crisis, and the potential fallout from stranded assets."

At Monday's hearing, PERA Chief Investment Officer Amy McGarrity told lawmakers that direct investments in the energy sector make up about 6 percent of the association's assets, but added that up to 14 percent could be considered fossil fuel-related.

As the defeat of HB 1270 proved, the Fossil Free PERA campaign faces an uphill battle, and several previous divestment campaigns in Colorado have ended in disappointment. In 2017, divestment activists unsuccessfully petitioned the University of Denver's Board of Trustees to sell off any investments in fossil fuels within its $607 million endowment, and efforts to convince the University of Colorado system to divest have also failed. So far, the only academic institution in Colorado to have dumped its fossil fuel investments is Boulder’s Naropa University.

But the movement has had more success at the local level in Colorado — including in Denver. Speaking at a mayoral debate at the Alliance Center last month, Mayor Michael Hancock announced that the city's Department of Finance is pursuing divestment from fossil fuels in order to ensure that its investments more closely “align with our values around sustainability and equity.”

“We’ve already started the process,” Hancock said. “The City of Denver has a $5 billion investment portfolio. Less than 1 percent was invested in companies that may be doing business in fossil fuels, and they’re coming to an end.”

In fact, fossil fuel holdings made up more than 3 percent of Denver’s investments at the end of 2018, according to documents obtained through an open-records request. The city owns nearly $180 million in corporate bonds issued by Chevron and Exxon Mobil — the most recent of which, a $5 million investment in Chevron, was purchased in December 2018.

A spokesperson for Hancock did not return a request for comment on when the City began its divestment process, or when it's expected to be completed.

Beyond direct investments in oil and gas, Denver's investment portfolio also includes significant investments in JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, two financial institutions that have been criticized by activists for their role in financing major fossil fuel projects like the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Today, April 10, activists with the environmental group 350.org plan to target JP Morgan Chase with a series of "Defund Disaster" events held across the country.

Over the past six months, increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists have led to new sense of urgency and momentum in climate advocacy, from protests in the halls of Congress to bold new policy proposals like the Green New Deal. And with New York City's landmark, multibillion-dollar divestment effort under way, activists hope that the tide has turned for the divestment movement nationwide — even in oil- and gas-rich Colorado.

“I think the pressure is mounting,” says McNamara. “The level of understanding and awareness around the issue is increasing. My worry is just that it’s not going to happen fast enough.”

Divestment alone won't solve the climate crisis, but activists view it as an important strategy for pressuring governments, private institutions and even fossil fuel companies themselves into taking necessary action. Alongside regulation, market incentives, shifts in consumer habits and other factors, a greater focus on sustainability in investing could help steer the world away from climate-wrecking fossil fuels — before it's too late.

“It’s one more market signal,” says Carreno. “You have this cumulative effect of everything from renewable energy to electric-vehicle adoption, and you combine that with cities and other governments divesting from fossil fuels — all of that influences how companies operate.”


The city of Austin has purchased an East Texas renewable power plant for $460 million as a means to escape from a punitive contract. The deal reached late Wednesday wiped out some of the financial hit of the remainder of a 20-year, $2.3 billion contract set to run through 2032, the head of Austin Energy said.

Austin Energy General Manager Jackie Sargent told the American-Statesman that the utility expects to save $275 million by buying the Nacogdoches Generating Facility, a wood chip-fueled biomass power plant that the city has used sparingly because the facility was often too expensive to run. The city has been the plant's only customer since 2012.

The Statesman first reported April 5 the possibility of the city purchasing the plant. At the time, city officials were bound by a strict confidentiality agreement that prevented them from acknowledging a possible sale. In actuality, though, the Austin City Council had already voted during a closed session on March 28 to buy the facility.

Southern Company, the plant's owner, accepted the offer this week, notifying Austin Energy at 10:40 p.m. Wednesday.

Sargent described the deal, one of the largest single purchases in the city's history, as a form of refinancing. Under a power purchase agreement with Southern Company, Austin Energy would have been on the hook for escalating annual payments whether or not the city bought energy from the 115-megawatt plant in Sacul, about 30 miles northwest of Nacogdoches. Those payments were in the tens of millions of dollars each year and were expected to grow to an estimated $90 million in the contract's last year.

"What this allows us to do is to avoid significant future costs had we remained under the power purchase agreement that we had with (Southern Company)," Sargent said.

The deal remained under wraps because of a strict confidentiality agreement that Southern Company required the city to sign to participate in the competitive sale, Sargent said. Barclays negotiated the sale for Southern Company, and the city hired a national law firm for $300,000 to negotiate on its behalf, according to a city spokesman.

Mayor Steve Adler said Thursday he had periodically looked into the one-sided biomass contract since he became mayor in 2015. When he heard that the plant was for sale, it was "welcomed news," he said.

"We went from a tenant position to buying the home, and the house payments are less than the rent," Adler said.

To finance the purchase, Austin Energy will issue taxable revenue bonds that will be paid out over 13 years, the same amount of time remaining on the city's contract with Southern Company, Sargent said.

In the purchase, Austin Energy is acquiring Nacogdoches Power LLC, the holding company for the biomass facility. Included in the deal is the assumption of the power purchase agreement that required the city to pay for electricity from the facility whether it used any energy from it or it didn't.

The sale will require no further action by the City Council. The council was permitted to approve the offer without the public's knowledge under a section of the Texas open meetings law that concerns competitive financial matters involving government entities that oversee utilities.

Council Member Kathie Tovo, the longest tenured member of the City Council, said the vote on the sale is the only vote she has ever taken during an executive session involving council members.

"The circumstances under which you can do that are extremely limited, and we talked about it," Tovo said.

Eleven years ago, the council sparked the construction of the renewable power plant in Sacul by inking a 20-year contract amid concerns that fossil fuel prices would skyrocket in the wake of new federal carbon taxes. But those carbon taxes never materialized, natural gas prices plummeted, and biomass-generated energy became an expensive afterthought.

The developments created a situation in which the city was paying for operations at a power plant that was not generating any electricity. The city does buy power from the facility when market prices for electricity peak during the summer.

Former City Council Member Don Zimmerman called the contract a $600 million "boondoggle."

"I guess it's behind us now," said Zimmerman, who sat on the dais in 2015 and 2016. "It’s a powerful argument for why you should not have a government-run utility."

Sargent said the city will continue to staff the plant and that its operations will be a part of the city's infrastructure portfolio, but she said the future of the biomass facility is not clear.

"We will continue to do resource planning, and we will evaluate the future economic viability of this facility through that process," Sargent said. "We intend right now to continue to operate the facility as it has (operated). We are making no immediate changes to operations. And we think that is important."
Members of the conservative Christian group Texas Values held a “Save Chick-fil-A Day” to advocate for legal discrimination against LGBTQ people. The chain is doing fine financially and does not require “saving.”

The far right org capitalized off the recent decision by the San Antonio city council to ban the notoriously homophobic fast food chain from opening a franchise in the local airport. They used the controversy to try to gin up support for a pair of bills that would give Christians a license to discriminate against LGBTQ people if they cite religion as their motivation.

“If there’s a couple of things that are certainly clear in Texas, it’s that you don’t mess with Chick-fil-A, and you don’t mess with religious freedom,” the group’s president told supporters during a press conference for the publicity stunt.

While the group spewed their reasons why LGBTQ people don’t deserve the same rights they enjoy, Republican Senator Ted Cruz showed up to give the far right protestors support.

Opponents of the legislation also rallied at the Statehouse that day, lobbying elected officials to vote down the bills. Samantha Smoot, Equality Texas Interim Executive Director, pointed out that activists have a hard road ahead to defeat the proposed legislation.

With the state firmly in far right Republican control, lieutenant governor Dan Patrick holds a lot of sway. Patrick has gone out of his way to oppose pro-LGBTQ moves and promotes measures that would actively harm the community.

“LGBTQ Texas are vital members of every community in Texas, and deserve the same opportunities as everyone else, to live, work, and contribute to this state,” said Samantha Smoot, Equality Texas Interim Executive Director. “But these most basic rights are again under attack in the Texas legislature. Under the leadership of Dan Patrick, the Senate has already passed, as of last night now, five anti-LGBT bills.”

Seven years ago, Chick-fil-A’s record of donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations came to light. The fast food chain had donated to the the SPLC-designated hate group Family Research Counsel and the conversion therapy group Exodus International.

CEO Dan Cathy told a newspaper that the company was “guilty as charged” of making anti-LGBTQ donations and said that marriage equality proponents “have the audacity to define what marriage is about” and were “inviting God’s judgment on our nation.”

Chick-fil-A has spent years trying to downplay these donations, saying that they “will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation” and that the company’s charity arm “is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.”

But that hasn’t stopped them from donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations. The company’s charity gave $1.8 million in donations to anti-LGBTQ groups in 2017 alone.

Mertens: 'Arsenal no stronger than Napoli'

By Football Italia staff

Dries Mertens insists Arsenal “aren’t that good and there isn’t a real gap between us,” but the first half performance in London was fatal for Napoli.

The Partenopei lost 2-0 at the Emirates and were beaten at the San Paolo 1-0 by Alexandre Lacazette’s free kick.

“The first 10-15 minutes, we had a few chances to score and that would’ve changed everything,” the Belgian told Sky Sport Italia.

“We conceded a goal and our heads dropped. We said in the locker room that we still believed, because Arsenal aren’t that good. There isn’t a real gap between us. We got it very wrong at the Emirates and that ruined everything.

“We weren’t well set out, Arsenal took advantage and we tried everything to make up for it, but they defended well.”

Mertens was asked what Napoli still needed to compete in Europe and he hinted at some jeers from the crowd.

“I don’t know what we are lacking. We have to realise we are normal players, we’re doing well and the fans mustn’t criticise us. We are second, we went out of the Champions League by one goal. Let’s get our feet on the ground and look forward.”

Photo: Jemal Countess/Getty Images This is part of the wreckage of Ethiopian Airlines Flight ET302, a Boeing 737 Max airliner that crashed on 11 March in Bishoftu, Ethiopia, killing all 157 passengers and crew.

I have been a pilot for 30 years, a software developer for more than 40. I have written extensively about both aviation and software engineering. Now it’s time for me to write about both together.

The Boeing 737 Max has been in the news because of two crashes, practically back to back and involving brand new airplanes. In an industry that relies more than anything on the appearance of total control, total safety, these two crashes pose as close to an existential risk as you can get. Though airliner passenger death rates have fallen over the decades, that achievement is no reason for complacency.

The 737 first appeared in 1967, when I was 3 years old. Back then it was a smallish aircraft with smallish engines and relatively simple systems. Airlines (especially Southwest) loved it because of its simplicity, reliability, and flexibility. Not to mention the fact that it could be flown by a two-person cockpit crew—as opposed to the three or four of previous airliners—which made it a significant cost saver. Over the years, market and technological forces pushed the 737 into ever-larger versions with increasing electronic and mechanical complexity. This is not, by any means, unique to the 737. Airliners constitute enormous capital investments both for the industries that make them and the customers who buy them, and they all go through a similar growth process.

Most of those market and technical forces are on the side of economics, not safety. They work as allies to relentlessly drive down what the industry calls “seat-mile costs”—the cost of flying a seat from one point to another.

Much had to do with the engines themselves. The principle of Carnot efficiency dictates that the larger and hotter you can make any heat engine, the more efficient it becomes. That’s as true for jet engines as it is for chainsaw engines.

It’s as simple as that. The most effective way to make an engine use less fuel per unit of power produced is to make it larger. That’s why the Lycoming O-360 engine in my Cessna has pistons the size of dinner plates. That’s why marine diesel engines stand three stories tall. And that’s why Boeing wanted to put the huge CFM International LEAP engine in its latest version of the 737.

There was just one little problem: The original 737 had (by today’s standards) tiny little engines, which easily cleared the ground beneath the wings. As the 737 grew and was fitted with bigger engines, the clearance between the engines and the ground started to get a little…um, tight.

Illustration: Norebbo.com By substituting a larger engine, Boeing changed the intrinsic aerodynamic nature of the 737 airliner.

Various hacks (as we would call them in the software industry) were developed. One of the most noticeable to the public was changing the shape of the engine intakes from circular to oval, the better to clear the ground.

With the 737 Max, the situation became critical. The engines on the original 737 had a fan diameter (that of the intake blades on the engine) of just 100 centimeters (40 inches); those planned for the 737 Max have 176 cm. That’s a centerline difference of well over 30 cm (a foot), and you couldn’t “ovalize” the intake enough to hang the new engines beneath the wing without scraping the ground.

The solution was to extend the engine up and well in front of the wing. However, doing so also meant that the centerline of the engine’s thrust changed. Now, when the pilots applied power to the engine, the aircraft would have a significant propensity to “pitch up,” or raise its nose.

The angle of attack is the angle between the wings and the airflow over the wings. Think of sticking your hand out of a car window on the highway. If your hand is level, you have a low angle of attack; if your hand is pitched up, you have a high angle of attack. When the angle of attack is great enough, the wing enters what’s called an aerodynamic stall. You can feel the same thing with your hand out the window: As you rotate your hand, your arm wants to move up like a wing more and more until you stall your hand, at which point your arm wants to flop down on the car door.

This propensity to pitch up with power application thereby increased the risk that the airplane could stall when the pilots “punched it” (as my son likes to say). It’s particularly likely to happen if the airplane is flying slowly.

Worse still, because the engine nacelles were so far in front of the wing and so large, a power increase will cause them to actually produce lift, particularly at high angles of attack. So the nacelles make a bad problem worse.

I’ll say it again: In the 737 Max, the engine nacelles themselves can, at high angles of attack, work as a wing and produce lift. And the lift they produce is well ahead of the wing’s center of lift, meaning the nacelles will cause the 737 Max at a high angle of attack to go to a higher angle of attack. This is aerodynamic malpractice of the worst kind.

Pitch changes with power changes are common in aircraft. Even my little Cessna pitches up a bit when power is applied. Pilots train for this problem and are used to it. Nevertheless, there are limits to what safety regulators will allow and to what pilots will put up with.

Pitch changes with increasing angle of attack, however, are quite another thing. An airplane approaching an aerodynamic stall cannot, under any circumstances, have a tendency to go further into the stall. This is called “dynamic instability,” and the only airplanes that exhibit that characteristic—fighter jets—are also fitted with ejection seats.

Everyone in the aviation community wants an airplane that flies as simply and as naturally as possible. That means that conditions should not change markedly, there should be no significant roll, no significant pitch change, no nothing when the pilot is adding power, lowering the flaps, or extending the landing gear.

The airframe, the hardware, should get it right the first time and not need a lot of added bells and whistles to fly predictably. This has been an aviation canon from the day the Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk.

Apparently the 737 Max pitched up a bit too much for comfort on power application as well as at already-high angles of attack. It violated that most ancient of aviation canons and probably violated the certification criteria of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. But instead of going back to the drawing board and getting the airframe hardware right (more on that below), Boeing relied on something called the “Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System,” or MCAS.

Boeing’s solution to its hardware problem was software.

I will leave a discussion of the corporatization of the aviation lexicon for another article, but let’s just say another term might be the “Cheap way to prevent a stall when the pilots punch it,” or CWTPASWTPPI, system. Hmm. Perhaps MCAS is better, after all.

MCAS is certainly much less expensive than extensively modifying the airframe to accommodate the larger engines. Such an airframe modification would have meant things like longer landing gear (which might not then fit in the fuselage when retracted), more wing dihedral (upward bend), and so forth. All of those hardware changes would be horribly expensive.

“Everything about the design and manufacture of the Max was done to preserve the myth that ‘it’s just a 737.’ Recertifying it as a new aircraft would have taken years and millions of dollars. In fact, the pilot licensed to fly the 737 in 1967 is still licensed to fly all subsequent versions of the 737.” —Feedback on an earlier draft of this article from a 737 pilot for a major airline

What’s worse, those changes could be extensive enough to require not only that the FAA recertify the 737 but that Boeing build an entirely new aircraft. Now we’re talking real money, both for the manufacturer as well as the manufacturer’s customers.

That’s because the major selling point of the 737 Max is that it is just a 737, and any pilot who has flown other 737s can fly a 737 Max without expensive training, without recertification, without another type of rating. Airlines—Southwest is a prominent example—tend to go for one “standard” airplane. They want to have one airplane that all their pilots can fly because that makes both pilots and airplanes fungible, maximizing flexibility and minimizing costs.

It all comes down to money, and in this case, MCAS was the way for both Boeing and its customers to keep the money flowing in the right direction. The necessity to insist that the 737 Max was no different in flying characteristics, no different in systems, from any other 737 was the key to the 737 Max’s fleet fungibility. That’s probably also the reason why the documentation about the MCAS system was kept on the down-low.

Put in a change with too much visibility, particularly a change to the aircraft’s operating handbook or to pilot training, and someone—probably a pilot—would have piped up and said, “Hey. This doesn’t look like a 737 anymore.” And then the money would flow the wrong way.

As I explained, you can do your own angle-of-attack experiments just by putting your hand out a car door window and rotating it. It turns out that sophisticated aircraft have what is essentially the mechanical equivalent of a hand out the window: the angle-of-attack sensor.

You may have noticed this sensor when boarding a plane. There are usually two of them, one on either side of the plane, and usually just below the pilot’s windows. Don’t confuse them with the pitot tubes (we’ll get to those later). The angle-of-attack sensors look like wind vanes, whereas the pitot tubes look like, well, tubes.

Angle-of-attack sensors look like wind vanes because that’s exactly what they are. They are mechanical hands designed to rotate in response to changes in that angle of attack.

The pitot tubes measure how much the air is “pressing” against the airplane, whereas the angle-of-attack sensors measure what direction that air is coming from. Because they measure air pressure, the pitot tubes are used to determine the aircraft’s speed through the air. The angle-of-attack sensors measure the aircraft’s direction relative to that air.

There are two sets of angle-of-attack sensors and two sets of pitot tubes, one set on either side of the fuselage. Normal usage is to have the set on the pilot’s side feed the instruments on the pilot’s side and the set on the copilot’s side feed the instruments on the copilot’s side. That gives a state of natural redundancy in instrumentation that can be easily cross-checked by either pilot. If the copilot thinks his airspeed indicator is acting up, he can look over to the pilot’s airspeed indicator and see if it agrees. If not, both pilot and copilot engage in a bit of triage to determine which instrument is profane and which is sacred.

Long ago there was a joke that in the future planes would fly themselves, and the only thing in the cockpit would be a pilot and a dog. The pilot’s job was to make the passengers comfortable that someone was up front. The dog’s job was to bite the pilot if he tried to touch anything.

On the 737, Boeing not only included the requisite redundancy in instrumentation and sensors, it also included redundant flight computers—one on the pilot’s side, the other on the copilot’s side. The flight computers do a lot of things, but their main job is to fly the plane when commanded to do so and to make sure the human pilots don’t do anything wrong when they’re flying it. The latter is called “envelope protection.”

Let’s just call it what it is: the bitey dog.

Let’s review what the MCAS does: It pushes the nose of the plane down when the system thinks the plane might exceed its angle-of-attack limits; it does so to avoid an aerodynamic stall. Boeing put MCAS into the 737 Max because the larger engines and their placement make a stall more likely in a 737 Max than in previous 737 models.

When MCAS senses that the angle of attack is too high, it commands the aircraft’s trim system (the system that makes the plane go up or down) to lower the nose. It also does something else: Indirectly, via something Boeing calls the “Elevator Feel Computer,” it pushes the pilot’s control columns (the things the pilots pull or push on to raise or lower the aircraft’s nose) downward.

In the 737 Max, like most modern airliners and most modern cars, everything is monitored by computer, if not directly controlled by computer. In many cases, there are no actual mechanical connections (cables, push tubes, hydraulic lines) between the pilot’s controls and the things on the wings, rudder, and so forth that actually make the plane move. And, even where there are mechanical connections, it’s up to the computer to determine if the pilots are engaged in good decision making (that’s the bitey dog again).

But it’s also important that the pilots get physical feedback about what is going on. In the old days, when cables connected the pilot’s controls to the flying surfaces, you had to pull up, hard, if the airplane was trimmed to descend. You had to push, hard, if the airplane was trimmed to ascend. With computer oversight there is a loss of natural sense in the controls. In the 737 Max, there is no real “natural feel.”

True, the 737 does employ redundant hydraulic systems, and those systems do link the pilot’s movement of the controls to the action of the ailerons and other parts of the airplane. But those hydraulic systems are powerful, and they do not give the pilot direct feedback from the aerodynamic forces that are acting on the ailerons. There is only an artificial feel, a feeling that the computer wants the pilots to feel. And sometimes, it doesn’t feel so great.

When the flight computer trims the airplane to descend, because the MCAS system thinks it’s about to stall, a set of motors and jacks push the pilot’s control columns forward. It turns out that the Elevator Feel Computer can put a lot of force into that column—indeed, so much force that a human pilot can quickly become exhausted trying to pull the column back, trying to tell the computer that this really, really should not be happening.

Illustration: Norebbo.com The antistall system depended crucially on sensors that are installed on each side of the airliner—but the system consulted only the sensor on one side.

Indeed, not letting the pilot regain control by pulling back on the column was an explicit design decision. Because if the pilots could pull up the nose when MCAS said it should go down, why have MCAS at all?

MCAS is implemented in the flight management computer, even at times when the autopilot is turned off, when the pilots think they are flying the plane. In a fight between the flight management computer and human pilots over who is in charge, the computer will bite humans until they give up and (literally) die.

Finally, there’s the need to keep the very existence of the MCAS system on the hush-hush lest someone say, “Hey, this isn’t your father’s 737,” and bank accounts start to suffer.

The flight management computer is a computer. What that means is that it’s not full of aluminum bits, cables, fuel lines, or all the other accoutrements of aviation. It’s full of lines of code. And that’s where things get dangerous.

Those lines of code were no doubt created by people at the direction of managers. Neither such coders nor their managers are as in touch with the particular culture and mores of the aviation world as much as the people who are down on the factory floor, riveting wings on, designing control yokes, and fitting landing gears. Those people have decades of institutional memory about what has worked in the past and what has not worked. Software people do not.

In the 737 Max, only one of the flight management computers is active at a time—either the pilot’s computer or the copilot’s computer. And the active computer takes inputs only from the sensors on its own side of the aircraft.

When the two computers disagree, the solution for the humans in the cockpit is to look across the control panel to see what the other instruments are saying and then sort it out. In the Boeing system, the flight management computer does not “look across” at the other instruments. It believes only the instruments on its side. It doesn’t go old-school. It’s modern. It’s software.

This means that if a particular angle-of-attack sensor goes haywire—which happens all the time in a machine that alternates from one extreme environment to another, vibrating and shaking all the way—the flight management computer just believes it.

It gets even worse. There are several other instruments that can be used to determine things like angle of attack, either directly or indirectly, such as the pitot tubes, the artificial horizons, etc. All of these things would be cross-checked by a human pilot to quickly diagnose a faulty angle-of-attack sensor.

In a pinch, a human pilot could just look out the windshield to confirm visually and directly that, no, the aircraft is not pitched up dangerously. That’s the ultimate check and should go directly to the pilot’s ultimate sovereignty. Unfortunately, the current implementation of MCAS denies that sovereignty. It denies the pilots the ability to respond to what’s before their own eyes.

Like someone with narcissistic personality disorder, MCAS gaslights the pilots. And it turns out badly for everyone. “Raise the nose, HAL.” “I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.”

In the MCAS system, the flight management computer is blind to any other evidence that it is wrong, including what the pilot sees with his own eyes and what he does when he desperately tries to pull back on the robotic control columns that are biting him, and his passengers, to death.

In the old days, the FAA had armies of aviation engineers in its employ. Those FAA employees worked side by side with the airplane manufacturers to determine that an airplane was safe and could be certified as airworthy.

As airplanes became more complex and the gulf between what the FAA could pay and what an aircraft manufacturer could pay grew larger, more and more of those engineers migrated from the public to the private sector. Soon the FAA had no in-house ability to determine if a particular airplane’s design and manufacture were safe. So the FAA said to the airplane manufacturers, “Why don’t you just have your people tell us if your designs are safe?”

The airplane manufacturers said, “Sounds good to us.” The FAA said, “And say hi to Joe, we miss him.”

Thus was born the concept of the “Designated Engineering Representative,” or DER. DERs are people in the employ of the airplane manufacturers, the engine manufacturers, and the software developers who certify to the FAA that it’s all good.

Now this is not quite as sinister a conflict of interest as it sounds. It is in nobody’s interest that airplanes crash. The industry absolutely relies on the public trust, and every crash is an existential threat to the industry. No manufacturer is going to employ DERs that just pencil-whip the paperwork. On the other hand, though, after a long day and after the assurance of some software folks, they might just take their word that things will be okay.

It is astounding that no one who wrote the MCAS software for the 737 Max seems even to have raised the possibility of using multiple inputs, including the opposite angle-of-attack sensor, in the computer’s determination of an impending stall. As a lifetime member of the software development fraternity, I don’t know what toxic combination of inexperience, hubris, or lack of cultural understanding led to this mistake.

But I do know that it’s indicative of a much deeper problem. The people who wrote the code for the original MCAS system were obviously terribly far out of their league and did not know it. How can they can implement a software fix, much less give us any comfort that the rest of the flight management software is reliable?

So Boeing produced a dynamically unstable airframe, the 737 Max. That is big strike No. 1. Boeing then tried to mask the 737’s dynamic instability with a software system. Big strike No. 2. Finally, the software relied on systems known for their propensity to fail (angle-of-attack indicators) and did not appear to include even rudimentary provisions to cross-check the outputs of the angle-of-attack sensor against other sensors, or even the other angle-of-attack sensor. Big strike No. 3.

None of the above should have passed muster. None of the above should have passed the “OK” pencil of the most junior engineering staff, much less a DER.

That’s not a big strike. That’s a political, social, economic, and technical sin.

It just so happens that, during the timeframe between the first 737 Max crash and the most recent 737 crash, I’d had the occasion to upgrade and install a brand-new digital autopilot in my own aircraft. I own a 1979 Cessna 172, the most common aircraft in history, at least by production numbers. Its original certification also predates that of the 737’s by about a decade (1955 versus 1967).

My new autopilot consists of several very modern components, including redundant flight computers (dual Garmin G5s) and a sophisticated communication “bus” (a Controller Area Network bus) that lets all the various components talk to one another, irrespective of where they are located in my plane. A CAN bus derives from automotive “drive by wire” technology but is otherwise very similar in purpose and form to the various ARINC buses that connect the components in the 737 Max.

My autopilot also includes electric pitch trim. That means it can make the same types of configuration changes to my 172 that the flight computers and MCAS system make to the 737 Max. During the installation, after the first 737 Max crash, I remember remarking to a friend that it was not lost on me that I was potentially adding a hazard similar to the one that brought down the Lion Air crash.

Finally, my new autopilot also implements “envelope protection,” the envelope being the graph of the performance limitations of an aircraft. If my Cessna is not being flown by the autopilot, the system nonetheless constantly monitors the airplane to make sure that I am not about to stall it, roll it inverted, or a whole host of other things. Yes, it has its own “bitey dog” mode.

As you can see, the similarities between my US $20,000 autopilot and the multimillion-dollar autopilot in every 737 are direct, tangible, and relevant. What, then, are the differences?

For starters, the installation of my autopilot required paperwork in the form of a “Supplemental Type Certificate,” or STC. It means that the autopilot manufacturer and the FAA both agreed that my 1979 Cessna 172 with its (Garmin) autopilot was so significantly different from what the airplane was when it rolled off the assembly line that it was no longer the same Cessna 172. It was a different aircraft altogether.

In addition to now carrying a new (supplemental) aircraft-type certificate (and certification), my 172 required a very large amount of new paperwork to be carried in the plane, in the form of revisions and addenda to the aircraft operating manual. As you can guess, most of those addenda revolved around the autopilot system.

Of particular note in that documentation, which must be studied and understood by anyone who flies the plane, are various explanations of the autopilot system, including its command of the trim control system and its envelope protections.

There are instructions on how to detect when the system malfunctions and how to disable the system, immediately. Disabling the system means pulling the autopilot circuit breaker; instructions on how to do that are strewn throughout the documentation, repeatedly. Every pilot who flies my plane becomes intimately aware that it is not the same as any other 172.

This is a big difference between what pilots who want to fly my plane are told and what pilots stepping into a 737 Max are (or were) told.

Another difference is between the autopilots in my system and that in the 737 Max. All of the CAN bus–interconnected components constantly do the kind of instrument cross-check that human pilots do and that, apparently, the MCAS system in the 737 Max does not. For example, the autopilot itself has a self-contained attitude platform that checks the attitude information coming from the G5 flight computers. If there is a disagreement, the system simply goes off-line and alerts the pilot that she is now flying manually. It doesn’t point the airplane’s nose at the ground, thinking it’s about to stall.

Perhaps the biggest difference is in the amount of physical force it takes for the pilot to override the computers in the two planes. In my 172, there are still cables linking the controls to the flying surfaces. The computer has to press on the same things that I have to press on—and its strength is nowhere near as great as mine. So even if, say, the computer thought that my plane was about to stall when it wasn’t, I can easily overcome the computer.

In my Cessna, humans still win a battle of the wills every time. That used to be a design philosophy of every Boeing aircraft, as well, and one they used against their archrival Airbus, which had a different philosophy. But it seems that with the 737 Max, Boeing has changed philosophies about human/machine interaction as quietly as they’ve changed their aircraft operating manuals.

The 737 Max saga teaches us not only about the limits of technology and the risks of complexity, it teaches us about our real priorities. Today, safety doesn’t come first—money comes first, and safety’s only utility in that regard is in helping to keep the money coming. The problem is getting worse because our devices are increasingly dominated by something that’s all too easy to manipulate: software.

Hardware defects, whether they are engines placed in the wrong place on a plane or O-rings that turn brittle when cold, are notoriously hard to fix. And by hard, I mean expensive. Software defects, on the other hand, are easy and cheap to fix. All you need to do is post an update and push out a patch. What’s more, we’ve trained consumers to consider this normal, whether it’s an update to my desktop operating systems or the patches that get posted automatically to my Tesla while I sleep.

Back in the 1990s, I wrote an article comparing the relative complexity of the Pentium processors of that era, expressed as the number of transistors on the chip, to the complexity of the Windows operating system, expressed as the number of lines of code. I found that the complexity of the Pentium processors and the contemporaneous Windows operating system was roughly equal.

That was the time when early Pentiums were affected by what was known as the FDIV bug. It affected only a tiny fraction of Pentium users. Windows was also affected by similar defects, also affecting only fractions of its users.

But the effects on the companies were quite different. Where Windows addressed its small defects with periodic software updates, in 1994 Intel recalled the (slightly) defective processors. It cost the company $475 million—more than $800 million in today’s money.

I believe the relative ease—not to mention the lack of tangible cost—of software updates has created a cultural laziness within the software engineering community. Moreover, because more and more of the hardware that we create is monitored and controlled by software, that cultural laziness is now creeping into hardware engineering—like building airliners. Less thought is now given to getting a design correct and simple up front because it’s so easy to fix what you didn’t get right later.

Every time a software update gets pushed to my Tesla, to the Garmin flight computers in my Cessna, to my Nest thermostat, and to the TVs in my house, I’m reminded that none of those things were complete when they left the factory—because their builders realized they didn’t have to be complete. The job could be done at any time in the future with a software update.

“I’m a software developer turned network engineer and have written airliner avionics software in the past. It was interesting how many hoops we had to jump through to get an add-on board for the computer certified, while software certifications were nil (other than “cannot run on Windows,” “must be written in C++”). This was, admittedly, nearly 10 years ago, and I hope that things have changed since.” —Anonymous, personal correspondence

Boeing is in the process of rolling out a set of software updates to the 737 Max flight control system, including MCAS. I don’t know, but I suspect that those updates will center on two things:

Having the software “cross-check” system indicators, just as a human pilot would. Meaning, if one angle-of-attack indicator says the plane’s about to stall, but the other one says it’s not so, at least hold off judgment about pushing the nose down into the dirt and maybe let a pilot or two know you’re getting conflicting signals. Backing off on the “shoot first, ask questions later” design philosophy—meaning, looking at multiple inputs.

For the life of me, I do not know why those two basic aviation design considerations, bedrocks of a mind-set that has served the industry so well until now, were not part of the original MCAS design. And, when they were not, I do not know or understand what part of the DER process failed to catch the fundamental design defect.

But I suspect that it all has to do with the same thing that brought us from Boeing’s initial desire to put larger engines on the 737 and to avoid having to internalize the cost of those larger engines—in other words, to do what every child is taught is impossible: get a free lunch.

The emphasis on simplicity comes from the work of Charles Perrow, a sociologist at Yale University whose 1984 book, Normal Accidents: Living With High-Risk Technologies, tells it all in the very title. Perrow argues that system failure is a normal outcome in any system that is very complex and whose components are “tightly bound”—meaning that the behavior of one component immediately controls the behavior of another. Though such failures may seem to stem from one or another faulty part or practice, they must be seen as inherent in the system itself. They are “normal” failures.

Nowhere is this problem more acutely felt than in systems designed to augment or improve safety. Every increment, every increase in complexity, ultimately leads to decreasing rates of return and, finally, to negative returns. Trying to patch and then repatch such a system in an attempt to make it safer can end up making it less safe.

This is the root of the old engineering axiom “Keep it simple, stupid” (KISS) and its aviation-specific counterpart: “Simplify, then add lightness.”

The original FAA Eisenhower-era certification requirement was a testament to simplicity: Planes should not exhibit significant pitch changes with changes in engine power. That requirement was written when there was a direct connection between the controls in the pilot’s hands and the flying surfaces on the airplane. Because of that, the requirement—when written—rightly imposed a discipline of simplicity on the design of the airframe itself. Now software stands between man and machine, and no one seems to know exactly what is going on. Things have become too complex to understand.

I cannot get the parallels between the 737 Max and the space shuttle Challenger out of my head. The Challenger accident, another textbook case study in normal failure, came about not because people didn’t follow the rules but because they did. In the Challenger case, the rules said that they had to have prelaunch conferences to ascertain flight readiness. It didn’t say that a significant input to those conferences couldn’t be the political considerations of delaying a launch. The inputs were weighed, the process was followed, and a majority consensus was to launch. And seven people died.

In the 737 Max case, the rules were also followed. The rules said you couldn’t have a large pitch-up on power change and that an employee of the manufacturer, a DER, could sign off on whatever you came up with to prevent a pitch change on power change. The rules didn’t say that the DER couldn’t take the business considerations into the decision-making process. And 346 people are dead.

It is likely that MCAS, originally added in the spirit of increasing safety, has now killed more people than it could have ever saved. It doesn’t need to be “fixed” with more complexity, more software. It needs to be removed altogether.

An earlier version of this article was cited in EE Times.

Editor's note: This story was updated on 21 April to clarify that the MCAS pushes the airliner’s nose by means of the “Elevator Feel Computer.”

Nel giorno della presentazione dell'accordo tra il colosso mondiale del turismo Airbnb e il Comune di Catania arriva la tegola: il servizio di car sharing Enjoy chiuderà i battenti a partire dalla fine di maggio.

Il servizio, innovativo e tecnologico, permette di poter noleggiare in maniera rapida una delle tante 500 rosse presenti nel tessuto cittadino. Un incentivo alla mobilità sostenibile in una città che aspira ad avere una dimensione europea. Ma, a partire dall'avvio del servizio nel 2016, si sono susseguiti i furti e gli atti vandalici che hanno colpito i mezzi e che hanno ridotto in maniera significativa la flotta presente a Catania.

Basti pensare che in poco meno di tre anni si è passati da 170 auto disponibili per il noleggio a sole 75 unità. Malgrado una maniera di prenotazione semplice e veloce, tramite app e pagamenti elettronici, e gli impianti di sorveglianza e monitoraggio gps i furti non si sono fermati. Eppure proprio a Catania vi era l'unico servizio del genere presente in Sicilia.

Il sindaco Pogliese esprime il suo disappunto: "E' vergognoso. Non possiamo che prenderne atto e stigmatizzare quello che è accaduto all'interno della nostra città ma i continui furti subiti hanno determinato questa scelta. Non possiamo che accoglierla con grande dispiacere. All'interno della città vi è un problema di sicurezza complessiva che sarà all'ordine del giorno in un comitato per l'ordine pubblico e la sicurezza su cui c'è sinergia assoluta tra prefettura, questura, guardia di finanza e carabinieri".
Members of the conservative Christian group Texas Values held a “Save Chick-fil-A Day” to advocate for legal discrimination against LGBTQ people. The chain is doing fine financially and does not require “saving.”

The far right org capitalized off the recent decision by the San Antonio city council to ban the notoriously homophobic fast food chain from opening a franchise in the local airport. They used the controversy to try to gin up support for a pair of bills that would give Christians a license to discriminate against LGBTQ people if they cite religion as their motivation.

“If there’s a couple of things that are certainly clear in Texas, it’s that you don’t mess with Chick-fil-A, and you don’t mess with religious freedom,” the group’s president told supporters during a press conference for the publicity stunt.

While the group spewed their reasons why LGBTQ people don’t deserve the same rights they enjoy, Republican Senator Ted Cruz showed up to give the far right protestors support.

Opponents of the legislation also rallied at the Statehouse that day, lobbying elected officials to vote down the bills. Samantha Smoot, Equality Texas Interim Executive Director, pointed out that activists have a hard road ahead to defeat the proposed legislation.

With the state firmly in far right Republican control, lieutenant governor Dan Patrick holds a lot of sway. Patrick has gone out of his way to oppose pro-LGBTQ moves and promotes measures that would actively harm the community.

“LGBTQ Texas are vital members of every community in Texas, and deserve the same opportunities as everyone else, to live, work, and contribute to this state,” said Samantha Smoot, Equality Texas Interim Executive Director. “But these most basic rights are again under attack in the Texas legislature. Under the leadership of Dan Patrick, the Senate has already passed, as of last night now, five anti-LGBT bills.”

Seven years ago, Chick-fil-A’s record of donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations came to light. The fast food chain had donated to the the SPLC-designated hate group Family Research Counsel and the conversion therapy group Exodus International.

CEO Dan Cathy told a newspaper that the company was “guilty as charged” of making anti-LGBTQ donations and said that marriage equality proponents “have the audacity to define what marriage is about” and were “inviting God’s judgment on our nation.”

Chick-fil-A has spent years trying to downplay these donations, saying that they “will treat every person equally, regardless of sexual orientation” and that the company’s charity arm “is now taking a much closer look at the organizations it considers helping, and in that process will remain true to its stated philosophy of not supporting organizations with political agendas.”

But that hasn’t stopped them from donating to anti-LGBTQ organizations. The company’s charity gave $1.8 million in donations to anti-LGBTQ groups in 2017 alone.

PREDATOR-B drones will be patrolling the Strait of Gibraltar this year after Spain signed a huge €216 million deal with the US.

Four fully equipped MQ-9 Reaper drones will soon be arriving to their new base in Talavera la Real in Badajoz – and they already have a mission.

The unmanned aircraft are to carry out surveillance in the Gulf of Cadiz and Gibraltar Strait to tackle illegal immigration and drug trafficking.

It comes as the Guardia Civil has struggled to tackle the surging drug trafficking epidemic which has seen outbursts of violence along the Costas over the past two years.

And according to OKDIARIO, citing military sources, this summer is set to see much more drug and people smuggling than last year.

Spain’s Air Force have been attending training sessions on how to use the military aircraft for the past few years and are expected to have the new fleet in the air in the latter half of 2019.

The deal with the US includes a state-of-the-art camera system for surveillance and a powerful long-range radar.

The drones have the capacity to be armed with missiles but Spain’s will not be carrying any.

Weighing in at two tonnes, the wings span 20 metres and allow the aircraft to fly up to speeds of 400km/hr for around 14 hours, meaning they can cover distances of around 2,000km.

The Predators will work on surveillance missions alongside the ‘P.3 Orion’ maritime patrol aircraft that Spain’s Armed Forces have been using in the Strait for years.

The ‘P.3 Orion’ are able to fly for more than twelve uninterrupted hours and have a network of sensors capable of locating a small boat from kilometers away, even at night or in extreme weather conditions.
Na última segunda (15), Moraes determinou que o site e a revista retirassem do ar reportagens e notas que citavam o presidente da Suprema Corte, ministro Dias Toffoli. Na ocasião, o relator do inquérito havia estipulado multa diária de R$ 100 mil para o eventual descumprimento da ordem judicial e mandou a Polícia Federal (PF) ouvir os responsáveis do site e da revista em até 72 horas.

Alexandre de Moraes revoga decisão de censurar sites

Moraes havia considerado a reportagem da "Crusoé" um "típico exemplo de fake news" porque a Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) afirmou que não havia recebido um documento que comprovaria que Toffoli era o personagem apelidado de "amigo do amigo de meu pai" em um e-mail trocado entre o empresário Marcelo Odebrecht e dois executivos da construtora, ao contrário do que afirmou a revista.

A TV Globo confirmou que o documento de fato foi anexado aos autos da Lava Jato, no dia 9 de abril, e seu conteúdo é o que a revista "Crusoé" descreveu na reportagem censurada pelo STF.

Após ser alvo de críticas, inclusive, de integrantes do Supremo, Alexandre de Moraes revogou nesta quinta-feira a censura com o argumento de que ficou comprovado que realmente existe o documento citado pela reportagem do site e da revista.

Segundo ele, como a PGR e o Supremo tomaram conhecimento do conteúdo do documento anexado em um dos processos em que Marcelo Odebrecht é alvo na Justiça Federal de Curitiba, se tornou "desnecessária" a manutenção da medida que ordenou a retirada da reportagem do ar.

"Diante do exposto, revogo a decisão anterior que determinou ao site O Antagonista e a revista Crusoé a retirada da matéria intitulada 'O amigo do amigo de meu pai” dos respectivos ambientes virtuais'", escreveu o magistrado em trecho da decisão.

O inquérito

Toffoli abre inquérito para investigar mensagens falsas e ataques ao STF

A investigação que apura ofensas a magistrados da mais alta Corte do país foi instaurada, em março, por ordem do presidente do Supremo. Na ocasião, Toffoli informou que Alexandre de Moraes – ex-ministro da Justiça e ex-secretário de Segurança Pública de São Paulo – iria conduzir as investigações.

O inquérito foi alvo de críticas de procuradores da República que atuam na Operação Lava Jato, juristas e até mesmo integrantes do STF. Um dos magistrados mais antigos da Suprema Corte, o ministro Marco Aurélio Mello foi uma das vozes mais críticas à decisão de Toffoli.

Nesta quinta-feira, em entrevista ao blog da colunista do G1 Andréia Sadi, Marco Aurélio defendeu que o Ministério Público Federal (MPF) recorresse ao Supremo para o plenário da Corte julgar a censura à reportagem. Mais tarde, em entrevista à Rádio Gaúcha, o magistrado classificou de "mordaça" a decisão do colega de tribunal.

Magistrado mais antigo do Supremo, o ministro Celso de Mello também criticou a censura, embora não tenha mencionado diretamente o episódio da revista e do site. Ele divulgou nesta quinta uma dura nota na qual afirmou que censura – "mesmo aquela ordenada pelo Poder Judiciário" – é 'ilegítima', 'autocrática' e 'incompatível' com liberdades fundamentais e defendeu a liberdade de expressão e imprensa.

A reportagem

Segundo reportagem publicada pela revista na última quinta (11), a defesa do empresário Marcelo Odebrecht juntou em um dos processos contra ele na Justiça Federal em Curitiba um documento no qual esclareceu que um personagem mencionado em e-mail, o "amigo do amigo do meu pai", era Dias Toffoli, que, à época, era advogado-geral da União.

Conforme a reportagem, Marcelo tratava no e-mail com o advogado da empresa – Adriano Maia – e outro executivo da Odebrecht – Irineu Meireles – sobre se tinham "fechado" com o "amigo do amigo". Não há menção a dinheiro ou a pagamentos de nenhuma espécie no e-mail.

Ao ser questionado pela força-tarefa da Lava Jato, o empresário respondeu: "Refere-se a tratativas que Adriano Maia tinha com a AGU sobre temas envolvendo as hidrelétricas do Rio Madeira. 'Amigo do amigo de meu pai' se refere a José Antônio Dias Toffoli". Toffoli atuou como advogado-geral da União entre 2007 e 2009, no governo Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Segundo a revista, o conteúdo foi enviado à Procuradoria-Geral da República para que a chefe do Ministério Público, Raquel Dodge, analisasse se queria ou não investigar o fato.

Em nota oficial divulgada na sexta-feira passada, a PGR afirmou que não tinha recebido nenhum material e não comentou o conteúdo da reportagem.

Na decisão desta quinta, Alexandre de Moraes destacou que o documento citado na reportagem "realmente existe". O ministro acrescentou, contudo, que não é verdadeira a informação de que o documento teria sido enviado anteriormente à PGR para investigação.

Moraes escreveu na decisão que ou os autores anteciparam o que seria feito pelo Ministério Público Federal, no que ele chamou de um exercício de "futurologia", ou induziram "a conduta posterior" do órgão.

O magistrado também enfatizou no despacho que a divulgação do documento sigiloso, ao qual somente as partes envolvidas tinham acesso, acabou sendo "irregularmente divulgado" e que essa "ilicitude" deverá ser "investigada".

Bolsonaro

O presidente Jair Bolsonaro parabenizou o ministro Alexandre de Moraes pela revogação da decisão que havia censurado reportagens da revista "Crusoé" e do site "O Antagonista".

"Parece que foi revogada. O próprio ministro Alexandre de Moraes revogou", afirmou. "Se for verdade isso – parece que é verdade – meu parabéns aí ao Alexandre de Moraes", afirmou o presidente.

DECISÃO

Trata-se de inquérito instaurado pela Portaria GP Nº 69, de 14 de março de 2019, do Excelentíssimo senhor Ministro Presidente, nos termos do art. 43 do Regimento Interno desta CORTE, para o qual fui designado para condução, considerando a existência de notícias fraudulentas (fake news), denunciações caluniosas, ameaças e infrações revestidas de animus caluniandi, diffamandi ou injuriandi, que atingem a honorabilidade e a segurança do Supremo Tribunal Federal, de seus membros e familiares, extrapolando a liberdade de expressão, como ressaltado pelo Decano desta CORTE, Ministro CELSO DE MELLO:

“Ninguém tem o direito de atassalhar a honra alheia, nem de proferir doestos ou de vilipendiar o atrimônio moral de quem quer que seja ! A liberdade de palavra, expressão relevante do direito à livre manifestação do pensamento, não se reveste de caráter absoluto, pois sofre limitações que, fundadas no texto da própria Constituição da República (art. 5o., V e X, c/c o art. 220, § 1o., “in fine”) e em cláusulas inscritas em estatutos internacionais a que o Brasil aderiu (Convenção Americana de Direitos Humanos e Pacto Internacional sobre Direitos Civis e Políticos), deslegitimam o discurso insultuoso, moralmente ofensivo ou impregnado de ódio ! O abuso da liberdade de expressão constitui perversão moral e jurídica da própria ideia que, no regime democrático, consagra o direito do cidadão ao exercício das prerrogativas fundamentais de criticar, ainda que duramente, e de externar , mesmo que acerbamente e com contundência , suas convicções e sentimentos! Se é inegável que a liberdade constitui um valor essencial à condição humana, não é menos exato que não há virtude nem honra no comportamento daquele que, a pretexto de exercer a cidadania, degrada a prática da liberdade de expressão ao nível primário (e criminoso) do insulto, do abuso da palavra, da ofensa e dos agravos ao patrimônio moral de qualquer pessoa!” (trecho do voto proferido no julgamento do Agr. Reg. no Inquérito 4435, Tribunal Pleno, sessão de 14/3/2019). Em decisão de 13 de abril, determinei cautelarmente ao site O Antagonista e a revista Crusoé que retirassem matéria já veiculada nos respectivos ambientes virtuais e intitulada “O amigo do amigo de meu pai”, uma vez que esclarecimentos feitos pela Procuradoria Geral da República não confirmaram o teor e nem mesmo a existência de documento sigiloso referente a colaboração premiada com referência ao Presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal, citado pela reportagem como de posse daquele órgão.

Em virtude da flagrante incongruência entre a afirmação da matéria jornalística amplamente divulgada e os esclarecimento da PGR, solicitei à autoridade competente cópia integral dos autos referidos pela matéria, para verificação das afirmações realizadas.

A documentação solicitada (ofício 2881/2019 – IPL 1365/2015-4 SR/PF/PR) foi enviada, via SEDEX; tendo chegado hoje ao meu gabinete, para conhecimento. Ressalte-se, ainda, que, conforme informações do MM. Juiz da 13ª Vara Federal Criminal de Curitiba, o documento sigiloso referente a colaboração premiada citado na matéria jornalística somente teve seu desentranhamento solicitado pelo MPF-PR, para posterior remessa à PGR, na tarde da última sexta-feira, dia 12/04/2019.

É o relato do essencial.

Inicialmente, importante reiterar que o objeto deste inquérito é clara e específico, consistente na investigação de notícias fraudulentas (fake news), falsas comunicações de crimes, denunciações caluniosas, ameaças e demais infrações revestidas de animus caluniandi, diffamandi ou injuriandi, que atinjam a honorabilidade institucional do Supremo Tribunal Federal e de seus membros, bem como a segurança destes e de seus familiares, quando houver relação com a dignidade dos Ministros, inclusive com a apuração do vazamento de informações e documentos sigilosos, com o intuito de atribuir e/ou insinuar a prática de atos ilícitos por membros da Suprema Corte, por parte daqueles que tem o dever legal de preservar o sigilo; e a verificação da existência de esquemas de financiamento e divulgação em massa nas redes sociais, com o intuito de lesar ou expor a perigo de lesão a independência do Poder Judiciário e ao Estado de Direito.

Os atos investigados são práticas de condutas criminosas, que desvirtuando a liberdade de xpressão, pretendem utilizá-la como verdadeiro escudo protetivo para a consumação de atividades ilícitas contra os membros da Corte e a própria estabilidade institucional do Supremo Tribunal Federal.

Repudia-se, portanto, as infundadas alegações de que se pretende restringir o a liberdade de expressão e o sagrado direito de crítica, essencial à Democracia e ao fortalecimento institucional brasileiro, pois a liberdade de discussão, a ampla participação política e o princípio democrático estão interligados com a liberdade de expressão, em seu sentido amplo, abrangendo as liberdades de comunicação e imprensa, como destacado no célebre caso New York Times vs. Sullivan, onde a Suprema Corte NorteAmericana, afirmou ser “dever do cidadão criticar tanto quanto é dever do agente público administrar” (376 US, at. 282, 1964), sendo de absoluta e imprescindível importância a integral proteção à ampla possibilidade de realização de críticas contra ocupantes de cargos e funções públicas.

Conforme afirmei na ADI 4451, tanto a liberdade de expressão quanto a participação política em uma Democracia representativa somente se fortalecem em um ambiente de total visibilidade e possibilidade de exposição crítica das diversas opiniões sobre os governantes, como lembrava o JUSTICE HOLMES ao afirmar, com seu conhecido pragmatismo, a necessidade do exercício da política de desconfiança (politics of distrust) na formação do pensamento individual e na autodeterminação democrática, para o livre exercício dos direitos de sufrágio e oposição; além da necessária fiscalização dos órgãos governamentais.

No célebre caso Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630-1 (1919), OLIVER HOLMES defendeu a liberdade de expressão por meio do mercado livre das ideias (free marketplace of ideas), em que se torna imprescindível o embate livre entre diferentes opiniões, afastando-se a existência de verdades absolutas e permitindo-se a discussão aberta das diferentes ideias, que poderão ser aceitas, rejeitadas, desacreditadas ou ignoradas; porém, jamais censuradas, selecionadas ou restringidas previamente pelo Poder Público que deveria, segundo afirmou em divergência acompanhada pelo JUSTICE BRANDEIS, no caso Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375 (1927), “renunciar a arrogância do acesso privilegiado à verdade”.

A Constituição Federal de 1988 protege a liberdade de expressão no seu duplo aspecto: o positivo, que significa o “indivíduo poder se manifestar como bem entender”, e o negativo, que proíbe a ilegítima intervenção do Estado, por meio de censura prévia.

Trata-se do consagrado binômio LIBERDADE e RESPONSABILIDADE, jamais permitindo-se a existência de mecanismos de censura prévia, pois inconstitucionais, por visarem constranger ou inibir a liberdade de expressão. A censura prévia tem como traço marcante o “caráter preventivo e abstrato” de restrição à livre manifestação de pensamento, que é repelida frontalmente pelo texto constitucional, em virtude de sua finalidade antidemocrática.

A plena proteção constitucional da exteriorização da opinião (aspecto positivo), porém, não significa a impossibilidade posterior de análise e responsabilização por eventuais informações injuriosas, difamantes, mentirosas, e em relação a eventuais danos materiais e morais, pois os direitos à honra, intimidade, vida privada e à própria imagem formam a proteção constitucional à dignidade da pessoa humana, salvaguardando um espaço íntimo intransponível por intromissões ilícitas externas.

Nosso texto constitucional consagra, portanto, a PLENA LIBERDADE DE EXPRESSÃO, SEM CENSURA PRÉVIA E COM POSSIBILIDADE DE RESPONSABILIZAÇAO POSTERIOR, de maneira que o exercício da liberdade de expressão, em seu aspecto positivo, permite posterior responsabilidade pelo conteúdo ilícito difundido, tanto no campo cível (danos materiais e morais), quanto na esfera criminal, caso tipificado pela lei penal; fazendo cessar a injusta agressão, além da previsão do direito de resposta.

Foi o que ocorreu na presente hipótese, onde inexistente qualquer censura prévia, determinou-se cautelarmente a retirada posterior de matéria baseada em documento sigiloso cuja existência e veracidade não estavam sequer comprovadas e com potencialidade lesiva à honra pessoal do Presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal e institucional da própria Corte, que não retratava a verdade dos fatos, como bem salientado pela Procuradoria Geral da República, ao publicar a seguinte nota de esclarecimento:

“Ao contrário do que afirma o site O Antagonista, a Procuradoria-Geral da República (PGR) não recebeu nem da força tarefa Lava Jato no Paraná e nem do delegado que preside o inquérito 1365/2015 qualquer informação que teria sido entregue pelo colaborador Marcelo Odebrecht em que ele afirma que a descrição “amigo do amigo de meu pai” refere-se ao presidente do Supremo Tribunal federal (STF), Dias Toffoli”.

Posteriormente, informações prestadas pelo MM. Juiz Federal da 13ª Vara Criminal de Curitiba corroboraram os esclarecimentos feitos pela PGR, pois o documento sigiloso citado na reportagem não havia sequer sido remetido à Procuradoria Geral da República. Somente na tarde do dia 12 de abril, ou seja, após publicação e ampla divulgação da matéria, o MPF do Paraná solicitou o desentranhamento do referido documento e seu envio à Chefia da Instituição.

Da mesma maneira, conforme ressaltado, a documentação solicitada à Polícia Federal (ofício 2881/2019 – IPL 1365/2015-4 SR/PF/PR) foi enviada, via SEDEX; tendo chegado hoje ao meu gabinete, para conhecimento.

Comprovou-se que o documento sigiloso citado na matéria realmente existe, apesar de não corresponder à verdade o fato que teria sido enviado anteriormente à PGR para investigação. Na matéria jornalística, ou seus autores anteciparam o que seria feito pelo MPF do Paraná, em verdadeiro exercício de futurologia, ou induziram a conduta posterior do Parquet; tudo, porém, em relação a um documento sigiloso somente acessível às partes no processo, que acabou sendo irregularmente divulgado e merecerá a regular investigação dessa ilicitude.

A existência desses fatos supervenientes – envio do documento à PGR e integralidade dos autos ao STF – torna, porém, desnecessária a manutenção da medida determinada cautelarmente, pois inexistente qualquer apontamento no documento sigiloso obtido mediante suposta colaboração premiada, cuja eventual manipulação de conteúdo pudesse gerar irreversível dano a dignidade e honra do envolvido e da própria Corte, pela clareza de seus termos.

Diante do exposto, REVOGO a decisão anterior que determinou ao site O Antagonista e a revista Crusoé a retirada da matéria intitulada “O amigo do amigo de meu pai” dos respectivos ambientes virtuais.

Intime-se e publique-se.

Brasília, 18 de abril de 2019.

Ministro ALEXANDRE DE MORAES
For years, Gavin McInnes has spewed bigoted views on everything from race and religion to gender and immigration. He has described a transgender person as “[a] hideous man who thinks he’s a woman;” claimed that “Muslims can rape children with reckless abandon;” and argued that a Black man who is “mistaken for a homeless man,” should be “mad” not at the person who mischaracterizes him, but “at all the homeless black men who . . . created this stereotype in the first place.” As a result, McInnes has made quite a name for himself.

Yet in a lawsuit he filed in February against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), McInnes claims that it’s SPLC’s characterizations of him, not his own repugnant views that have given him a bad name in the eyes of the public. Specifically, he claims that SPLC has inaccurately characterized him as a “neo-masculine reactionary” and “self-described Islamophobe” who founded a “hate group” and expresses “extremist,” “blatantly misogynistic,” and “anti-gay” views. Because he maintains that he should instead be referred to as a “satirical” and “rebellious, humorist, businessman, political commentator and social critic,” McInnes sued SPLC for defamation.

As tweeted by his attorney, his theory is, in part, “You may not agree with what I say. But I hope you’ll fight with me for the right not be called a Nazi for saying it[.]” It’s worth noting it was McInnes’ attorney who used the term “Nazi” – that one didn’t come from SPLC.

The problem with McInnes’ theory is: that’s not how the First Amendment works.

Courts around the country have held that individuals cannot be sued for calling out the views of others as racist, fascist, homophobic, radical, or sexist. As we and the Center for Constitutional Rights explained in a friend-of-the-court brief we submitted last week in support of SPLC, such statements of opinion criticizing hateful or bigoted views lie at the core of First Amendment protection. They enable us to express ourselves (including our disgust), they animate our political discussion, and they offer us a tool to persuade others. For debate on political issues to flourish, we must be able to express our views about the prejudices of others without fearing that a defamation lawsuit could arise from our words.

The Supreme Court emphasized the danger that defamation suits can pose to First Amendment freedoms in New York Times v. Sullivan — a defamation lawsuit brought by a police commissioner in Montgomery, Alabama against four Black clergy members and the New York Times. The commissioner sued over a full-page advertisement in the Times describing an “unprecedented wave of terror” unleashed to quash widespread, peaceful protests by thousands of Black students as part of the Civil Rights Movement. Although the ad included some factual inaccuracies, the Supreme Court held that the public official had failed to establish a case because he had not shown that the Black clergy members and the Times spoke with “actual malice”— that is, that they made the false statements knowing that they were false, or even with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not.

In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court emphasized our “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.” This commitment, embodied in the First Amendment, enables us to vigorously debate ideas and push for political and social change — both by vocally embracing the ideas with which we agree, and by lambasting those we wish were no longer accepted by others in society.

We all have the right to express our views, McInnes included. And we equally have the right to disagree with — and even condemn — the views expressed by others. McInnes’ attempt to silence those who have every right to call him out for his bigoted views should fall flat. That’s how the First Amendment works.
Initial jobless claims keep grinding lower and lower.

The last time this few Americans sought the help of government after losing a job was in November 1969. Initial Jobless Claims tumbled another 5K from the prior week's revised 197K to just 192K: the second consecutive sub-200K print in 50 years, and the lowest print since September 1969.

The YTD change in the absolute number of claims is now the best since at least 2011.

While the number will probably not come as a big surprise in light of the recent sharp rebound in payrolls, the Fed will be hard pressed to explain why it is pausing its rate hikes at a time when the fewest number of Americans are filing for jobless benefits in half a century.

For some context, the last time claims were this low:

The Beatles' "Abbey Road" Album hit #1

Wendy's Hamburgers, American fast food restaurant chains founded by Dave Thomas opens in Columbus, Ohio

So much for that government shutdown Q1 weakness.
There have been a lot of ideas since the beginning, since George first came up with this, of where things could go. We had a meeting with him before we even wrote the script about this. So a lot of what we have taken, is really taken to heart, everything that's come before. While it's been obviously significantly challenging, it's been a greater opportunity than a challenge. I cannot wait for you to see what this movie is.

Speaking on Fox News just hours after the highly anticipated report was released with some redactions, Wallace gave his initial reaction to Mueller’s findings.

“I would have to say, reading this report, there is a lot of stuff in here that is damaging to the president, politically embarrassing to the president,” Wallace said.

Wallace pointed specifically to Trump's directions to allies as described in the report as potentially damaging for the president.

“He directs various people — his White House counsel Don McGahn, his former campaign manager Cory Lewandowski, other people — to interfere, to try to stop the Mueller investigation, but it never actually happens,” Wallace said.

Wallace added that while Democrats will likely use the report to continue investigating Trump and holding hearings, he said he does not see enough in the report to support an impeachment attempt.

“I don’t see much of a basis here for impeachment, and certainly not enough, because you have Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiTrump pushes back on impeachment talk: 'Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!'

The White House Thursday ripped the “breathless” media coverage of the Russia collusion “hoax” and said now that it’s over, journalists should turn their attention on Obama-era scandals.

“While the establishment media has breathlessly covered this partisan witch hunt for nearly two years, they refuse to cover the real scandals that plagued the previous Democrat administration,” said an official.

The campaign manager of the Trump 2020 reelection campaign, Brad Parscale, added, "Now that the collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were, the Obama-era [Department of Justice] and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam that they perpetrated against the American people. Justice will be served.”

[READ: Robert Mueller's redacted Russia report]

The administration cited the email scandal that dogged former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose loss to President Trump in 2016 still shocks Democrats.

The administration noted that former President Barack Obama gave the email scandal a pass when, on "60 Minutes," he said it was a “mistake” but not “a national security problem."

That comment raised concern in national security circles, and one former official said, “That’s a problem, right?”

It also cited the destruction of over 30,000 Clinton emails from her private server in New York after a preservation order had been issued.

The White House also wants the Clinton Foundation’s funding investigated and the efforts by FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok to undermine Trump and help Clinton in the 2016 election.
“Power Is Power”

“Power Is Power” sounds like someone trying to fake their way through a conversation about “Game of Thrones.” Crowns and queens. Fire and ice. Something something stabbed in the heart. “I was born of the ice and snow/With the winter wolves and the dark, alone,” the Weeknd sings, channeling Jon Snow, or maybe Robert Plant. As a work of vapid and self-serious fantasy pop that carries only trace amounts of what’s special about fantasy or pop, this For the Throne alliance with SZA and Travis Scott is unadventurous to the point of passivity—everything the show, at its best, isn’t.

The song takes its title from one of the most enduring, delicious moments from the show’s second season. As the drab synth tones drip into glitchy drum programming, each member of the trio takes a turn on the Iron Throne, grasping at this elusive flex. They want to be Queen Cersei Lannister, witty and in control, but really they’re the bumbling footsoldiers of the Queen’s Guard: beholden to the authority of their overlord. Their lazy and ultimately empty allusions to the show and its plotting are bogged down by performances as unfeeling and mindless as a wight plowed through with a burning sword.

The Weeknd and SZA are no strangers to switching on autopilot for “music inspired by” Hollywood behemoths. Both had turns producing generic, lifeless singles for the Marvel Studios juggernaut Black Panther. Both are better than this. There are but a few landmark events left in our shrinking monoculture, and operating on behalf of huge brands can cause some artists to lose sight of themselves in the face of so much IP. Here, the music is swallowed by the advertising. In their desperate attempts to speak for the show’s massive audience, the trio of “Power Is Power” yield nearly all of theirs.

Democratic presidential candidate Eric Swalwell called on Attorney General William Barr to resign over the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's findings, saying he'd "lost the credibility of the American people."

Swalwell, who serves on both the House Judiciary Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, made the comments during a Thursday MSNBC appearance to discuss the release of Mueller's full report—sparing redactions for sensitive information. Despite "no evidence" of collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, Swalwell said the report left issues to be addressed.

Mueller's "investigation lays out that the Trump team, the president himself, lied and obstructed in ways that impaired in a material fashion the investigation," the California congressman said. "Just because you may bury the evidence deep enough that we can't find everything you did, we have recourse in the United States, which is obstruction of justice."

Claiming that the findings proved President Donald Trump was a "double digit obstructer," Swalwell turned his fire on Barr.

"You can be the attorney general of the United States and represent all of us or you can represent Donald Trump," the congressman said. "You can't do both. And because Attorney General Barr wants to represent Donald Trump, I think he should resign."

"You are calling for the attorney general's resignation today?" MSNBC's Nicole Wallace said.

"Yes, he's lost the credibility of the American people," Swalwell said. "He is not recused from an investigation where he should be recused. He's embedded deeply into the Trump team and that effects the credibility that the attorney general must have."

Wallace questioned if the report's findings were a "call to duty" for Swalwell and fellow congressional Democrats to "commence impeachment proceedings" against Trump.

"Our investigation is already begun," Swalwell said. "We have a meeting this afternoon on the Judiciary Committee and we are first seeking to bring Bob Mueller in to testify to the full report because we paid for this report. We should see all of it including what's redacted as long as it doesn't affect anything ongoing."

"Aside from the investigation and looking backward, we also now have to have the imagination to put into law prohibition against so much of a conduct that the president and his team did. Just because congress in the past didn't have an imagination to prohibit a campaign from working in such a fashion with Russians doesn't mean we shouldn't put in new laws to protect our democracy from any campaign doing that in the future. I think making this about the future is the best way for us to go forward."

"Does the future include commencing impeachment proceedings based on what you're reading in the Mueller Report?" Wallace said.

"I'm going to leave that to [House Judiciary] chairman Nadler," Swalwell said. "There are concerning contacts the campaign had with the Russians and the way that the president lied, he certainly acted guilty and there are consequences for the way he and the people on his team acted."
Now we know why Attorney General William Barr went to such great lengths to spin the contents of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Although Mueller’s team didn’t establish that Trump or anybody connected to his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russian trolls and hackers, the investigation dug up voluminous evidence that the President repeatedly tried to hamper, and even close down, the Russia investigation. The only partial mystery that remains is why Mueller backed away from concluding whether Trump’s efforts at obstruction amounted to a crime.

The body of the report provides new details about some interventions that we already knew about, including Trump’s request to the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to lay off Michael Flynn, the national-security adviser; his subsequent firing of Comey; and his attempt, in June, 2017, to get rid of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who, to Trump’s fury, had recused himself from the Russia investigation. We also learned that Trump called the White House counsel, Don McGahn, from Camp David to order him to have Mueller fired, and that McGahn then called Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff, and told him the President had asked him “to do crazy shit.”

The report also reveals previously undisclosed instances of the President’s bullying tactics, such as when, shortly after McGahn refused to fire Sessions, Trump asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to tell the Attorney General to unrecuse himself and order Mueller to focus the Russia investigation on preventing future election interference. He also told Lewandowski to ask Sessions to issue a public statement saying that Trump hadn’t done anything wrong and there shouldn’t even be a special-counsel investigation. Lewandowski passed off some of these requests to Rick Dearborn, a senior White House official who had previously worked as Sessions’s chief of staff. According to the report, Dearborn “did not follow through.”

In assessing Trump’s behavior, the report uses some satisfyingly plain English, such as this paragraph on page 156 of the second volume, which relates to obstruction:

Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President’s direction to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by his direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia investigation to prospective election-interference only—a temporal connection that suggests that both acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.

Although the report doesn’t contain a formal prosecutorial judgment, it does dismiss some of the possible defenses for Trump’s efforts to influence the Russia investigation, such as the fact that some of them were carried out in public, often via his Twitter account. As the report notes, “many of the President’s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public view. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a corrupt intent, the President’s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his unique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law excludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to intimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system’s integrity is equally threatened.”

The report also goes directly to the issue of Trump’s intent, and it dismisses the argument that he cannot be culpable for obstruction because the report didn’t find evidence of underlying collusion:

In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime relating to Russian campaign interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events—such as advanced notice of Wikileaks’ release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians—could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.

The report also acknowledges an evolution in Trump’s attitude toward the investigation. In the first stage, before firing Comey, he was furious that the F.B.I. director would not state publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation. But, after Mueller was appointed and Trump discovered that the special counsel was looking at the possibility of whether Trump had attempted to obstruct justice, the President’s attitude changed, and this led to “the start of a second phase of action”:

The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who would could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the Attorney General; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the investigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the government.

Finally, the report points out that, although Trump’s attempts to limit and shut down the investigation didn’t ultimately work, that was not because of a lack of effort or intent on his part. Instead, some of the people around him refused to do what he wanted them to do. The language of the report could hardly be more blunt:

The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons surrounding the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President’s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections the events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so.

If you add all this together, it would be hard for any objective observer to reach a conclusion other than that Trump tried repeatedly to obstruct the inquiry. Which brings us back to the question of why Mueller didn’t say whether this amounted to obstruction of justice.

In lengthy legal arguments, Mueller did reject the argument put forward by Trump’s lawyers (and by Barr, in an infamous memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in June, 2018) that a President cannot obstruct justice. According to the report, “We were not persuaded by the argument that the President has blanket constitutional immunity to engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct justice through the exercise of otherwise valid Article II powers.”

But Mueller and his colleagues did take seriously the Justice Department’s legal guidelines, which say that a sitting President cannot be indicted. “We recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct,” the report says. It goes on, “The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An individual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name. In contrast, a prosecutor’s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.”

Then comes another key sentence, which also refers to the Justice Department guidelines: “The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor’s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.” Like a formal indictment, it could “imperil the President’s ability to govern.”

The bottom line is that Mueller, a stickler for process, declined to reach a prosecutorial judgment because he was keen to follow Justice Department guidelines, even though Barr and many former Justice Department officials have said that they were surprised at this decision. Lawyers and historians will be debating it for decades. I’ve said before that I consider it a cop-out.

In any case, Mueller did not fail to provide a great deal of evidence that Trump tried to obstruct justice, and he did not accede to the notion that nothing should be done about it. “The protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person—including the President—accords with the fundamental principle of our government,” the final section of the report states, citing the 1881 case of United States v. Lee: “No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.”

A previous version of this post misstated which official Trump instructed McGahn to fire.
Dad fights off dingoes that took toddler from camper trailer on Fraser Island off Queensland coast

Updated

Two dingoes have dragged a sleeping toddler from a camper trailer on Fraser Island off Queensland's coast.

Key points: The boy was dragged metres from the camper trailer

He was bitten on the neck and head and has been flown to hospital in a stable condition

The boy's father spotted several other dingoes while fighting off one that still had hold of his son

The boy suffered a fractured skull, two deep lacerations to the back of his neck and head, and several minor lacerations to the back of the scalp.

The 14-month-old's parents were woken by his cries about midnight and when his father ran to look for him, he found the boy had been taken metres away from the trailer.

Paramedic Ben Du Toit got the call for help, despite the family's poor phone reception.

"According to the family, he was dragged from the campervan, several metres away," he said.

"The parents awoke with the toddler crying and heard the crying getting further away from the campervan.

"The dad got out to investigate and found the dingo dragging the toddler away.

"He also spotted several other dingoes near the vicinity."

Mr Du Toit said the dad fought off the animals and succeeded in getting his son away.

"He immediately ran up and dragged his son and chased some of the dingoes off."

Dingoes believed to have slipped under canvas

Mr Du Toit met the family at the nearby Eurong resort, where there was better phone reception, and the chopper arrived about 12:30am.

The child was flown to Hervey Bay Hospital in a stable condition but was transferred about 8:00am to Queensland Children's Hospital in Brisbane.

Lifeflight pilot Frank Bertoli said if it was not for his parents and their quick thinking, the toddler would have had more serious injuries.

"I think he [a dingo] made his way under the canvas to get into the camper trailer," he said.

"It's pretty horrific to hear something like that come over the phone and we just wanted to get there to be able to help.

"They said that the main dingo was surrounded by others."

The Environment Department believed two dingoes entered the camper trailer, with rangers currently attempting to identify them.

Specialist rangers investigating

Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service principal ranger Daniel Clifton said patrols have increased, specialised dingo rangers are on the island and will be visiting campers to remind them of the dangers.

He said rangers were still working to track down the animals involved, adding the family was camping outside a fenced area to the north of Eurong.

"Obviously it occurred at night, it was dark," he said.

"We can identify dingoes to some extent, but obviously, it takes a ranger being there or a really good description or a photo."

Mr Clifton said it was generally out of character for dingoes to go all the way into sleeping quarters.

Euthanasia has not been ruled out.

"[The decision] is taken with all the information gathered together, and in consultation with the Butchulla traditional owners," he said.

Campers on Fraser Island are advised to keep children within arm's length, walk in groups and lock food up away from tents.

People are also advised not to run when faced with a dingo, as it is said it can often trigger a negative reaction.

Not the first dingo attack on Fraser Island

The incident comes after a six-year-old boy was bitten multiple times at Eurong in January.

And a nine-year-old boy and his mother were attacked in February.

Authorities said at the time the pair had just got out of a vehicle when they came across a pack of dingoes.

They panicked and ran back towards the vehicle and it was at that time the pack chased them and attacked.

What if I told you there was a paper on climate change that was so uniquely catastrophic, so perspective-altering, and so absolutely depressing that it's sent people to support groups and encouraged them to quit their jobs and move to the countryside?

Good news: there is. It's called "Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy." I was introduced to it via an unlikely source—a guy formerly in advertising who had left his job to become a full-time environmental campaigner. "We're fucked," he told me. "Climate change is going to fuck us over. I remember thinking, Should I just accept the deep adaptation paper and move to the Scottish countryside and wait out the apocalypse?"

"Deep Adaptation" is quite unlike any other academic paper. There's the language ("we are about to play Russian Roulette with the entire human race with already two bullets loaded"). There's the flashes of dark humor ("I was only partly joking earlier when I questioned why I was even writing this paper"). But most of all, there's the stark conclusions that it draws about the future. Chiefly, that it's too late to stop climate change from devastating our world—and that "climate-induced societal collapse is now inevitable in the near term."

How near? About a decade.

Professor Jem Bendell, a sustainability academic at the University of Cumbria, wrote the paper after taking a sabbatical at the end of 2017 to review and understand the latest climate science "properly—not sitting on the fence anymore," as he puts it on the phone to me.

What he found terrified him. "The evidence before us suggests that we are set for disruptive and uncontrollable levels of climate change, bringing starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war," he writes in the paper. "Our norms of behavior—that we call our 'civilization'—may also degrade."

"It is time," he adds, "we consider the implications of it being too late to avert a global environmental catastrophe in the lifetimes of people alive today."

Even a schmuck like me is familiar with some of the evidence Bendell sets out to prove his point. You only needed to step outside during the record-breaking heatwave last year to acknowledge that 17 of the 18 hottest years on the planet have occurred since 2000. Scientists already believe we are soon on course for an ice-free Arctic, which will only accelerate global warming. Back in 2017, even Fox News reported scientists' warnings that the Earth's sixth mass extinction was underway.

Erik Buitenhuis, a senior researcher at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, tells me that Bendell's conclusions may sound extreme, but he agrees with the report's overall assessment. "I think societal collapse is indeed inevitable," he says, though adds that "the process is likely to take decades to centuries."

The important thing, Buitenhuis says, is to realize that the negative effects of climate change have already been with us for some time: "Further gradual deterioration looks much more likely to me than a disaster within the next ten years that will be big enough that, after that, everybody will agree the status quo is doomed."

"Jem's paper is in the main well-researched and supported by relatively mainstream climate science," says Professor Rupert Read, chair of the Green House think-tank and a philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia. "That's why I'm with him on the fundamentals. And more and more people are."

Read's key disagreement with Bendell is his belief that we still have time to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, saying, "I think it's hubris to think that we know the future." But that doesn't mean Bendell's premise is wrong: "The way I see it, deep adaptation is insurance against the possibility—or rather, the probability—of some kind of collapse," says Read. "'Deep Adaptation' is saying, 'What do we need to do if collapse is something we need to realistically plan for?'"

When I speak to Bendell, he tells me he thinks of "Deep Adaptation" as more of an ethical and philosophical framework, rather than a prophecy about the future of the planet. "The longer we refuse to talk about climate change as already here and screwing with our way of life—because we don't want to think like that because it's too frightening or will somehow demotivate people—the less time we have to reduce harm," he says with deliberation.

What does he mean by harm? "Starvation is the first one," he answers, pointing to lowering harvests of grain in Europe in 2018 due to drought that saw the EU reap 6 million tons less wheat. "In the scientific community at the moment, the appropriate thing is to say that 2018 was an anomaly. However, if you look at what's been happening over the last few years, it isn't an anomaly. There's a possibility that 2018 is the new best case scenario."

That means, in Bendell's view, that governments need to start planning emergency responses to climate change, including growing and stockpiling food.

He minces his words even less in his paper: "When I say starvation, destruction, migration, disease, and war, I mean in your own life. With the power down, soon you won't have water coming out of your tap. You will depend on your neighbors for food and some warmth. You will become malnourished. You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being violently killed before starving to death."

Should people start building bunkers and buying bulletproof vests? "There's no way of getting through this unless we try together," he says. "We need to help people stay fed and watered where they live already to reduce disruption and reduce civil unrest as much as we can." Of the Silicon Valley financiers prepping for the apocalypse in New Zealand, he says: "Once money doesn't matter anymore and the armed guards are trying to feed their starving children, what do you think they'll do? The billionaires doing that are just deluded."

Bendell wasn't always this gloomy about the state of the world. He once worked for WWF, one of the biggest environmental charities in the world, and in 2012 founded the Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria. The World Economic Forum named him a Young Global Leader for his work. So how did he end up writing a paper that determined that civilization—and environmental sustainability as we currently understand it—is doomed?

"Since the age of 15, I've been an environmentalist," he tells me. "I've given my life professionally and personally. I'm a workaholic, and it was all about sustainability." Once he sat down with the data, however, he realized that his field was quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of oncoming climate catastrophe. "It would mean not getting super excited about the expansion of your recycling program in a major multinational," he says. "It's a completely different paradigm of what we should be looking at."

What he didn’t expect was for the paper to take off online. "It was aimed at those people in my professional community and why we're in denial," he says. "When I put it out there, I didn’t expect 15-year-olds in schools in Indonesia to be reading it with their teachers." He says that "Deep Adaptation" has been downloaded over 110,000 times since it was released by IFLAS as an occasional paper. "Someone in the alternative economics and bitcoin crowd told me, 'Oh, everyone's talking about deep adaptation in London at all the dinner parties,'" he laughs.

Researchers from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), an established progressive think-tank, consulted Bendell's paper in the process of writing its new report, "This is a crisis: Facing up to the age of environmental breakdown." Laurie Laybourn-Langton, its lead author, told me via email: "I appreciated the frankness of the report in facing up to issues that so many in research and policy communities seem unwilling to. We don't subscribe to the view that social collapse is inevitable, however."

He explains: "This is partly because it's so hard to predict the outcomes of the complex and uncertain process of environmental shocks interacting with social and economic systems. We simply don't know. That said, they shouldn’t be disregarded as a potential outcome, and so we are calling for greater levels of preparedness to these shocks."

Not everyone was so taken with the paper. Bendell submitted it to a well-respected academic journal for publication, with little success. Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal (SAMPJ) told me that the paper was in need of "major revisions" before it would be ready for publication. Bendell ended up publishing it through IFLAS and his blog. "The academic process is such that I took that as an effective rejection," he explains, saying that the reviewers wanted him to fundamentally alter his conclusions. "I couldn't completely rewrite the paper to say that I don't think collapse is inevitable. It was asking for a different paper."

Emerald, the scholarly publisher that owns SAMPJ, says it takes issue with how Bendell frames its reception of its paper on his blog: "the study on collapse they thought you should not read—yet." A spokesperson told me: "The decision was arrived at based on the merit of the submitted article and the double blind peer review process integral to academia and the advancement of knowledge. SAMPJ, and [editor Carol Adams] are proud members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and adhere to the highest ethical standards in publishing. We see no evidence that the decision of Major Revision was politically motivated.

"Emerald requested the author correct their blog post to reflect the facts. This request was unfortunately ignored. The post continues to imply the paper was rejected because it was deemed too controversial. The paper was not rejected, and was given a Major Revision due to the rigorous standards of the scholarly output of the journal."

Bendell says he did reply to Emerald's request to amend his blog post—but only if they would consider telling him the decisions of those who reviewed his paper. (Under the double blind peer review, reviewers' decisions are anonymous.) "That title can be read in a number of ways," he says. "It is a paper that the reviewers didn't want you to read. They didn't want it published."

Climate gloom and doom is nothing new—doomsday preppers have been stockpiling their freeze-dried food rations for decades now. But Bendell's paper appears to have hit a unique nerve, especially given that the average scientific paper is estimated to be read by only three or so people. Rupert Read tells me that he was sent it simultaneously by three other academics when it was published. But it hasn’t trended on Twitter. It hasn't been pushed by a celebrity. It was briefly mentioned in a Bloomberg Businessweek article, but that's it.

"Deep Adaptation" is that unique social phenomenon: an academic paper that has gone viral through word of mouth.

Nathan Savelli, a 31-year-old high school life coach from Hamilton, Canada, was recommended the paper by a local environmental activist. Reading it sent him spiraling into depression. "I guess in some ways it felt like I was diagnosed with a terminal illness," he tells me. "If I'm being honest, it was a mix of heartbreaking sadness and extreme anger."

Savelli felt so low that he sought help from a climate grief support group organized by 350.org, the global grassroots climate movement. "I had attended counseling in the past for other issues, but never a group session, and thought it might be something helpful for me," he tells me. Did it help? "I'm not sure I'd say it alleviated my grief, but it was definitely comforting to be around people who understood what I was feeling."

And therein lies the problem with "Deep Adaptation:" if you accept that the paper is entirely correct in its prediction of collapse, how do you move on with your life? How do you even get out of bed in the morning?

"I'm aware of what difficult emotions it triggers," Bendell acknowledges. "I do believe that if you’ve come across this [paper], then absolutely some grief and despair is very natural. Why isn't that OK? We all die in the end. Life is about impermanence." On his blog, he lists several sources for psychological support, including several groups on Facebook and LinkedIn that discuss collapse and offer help to those struggling to come to terms with the conclusions of his paper.

But, Bendell adds, reading the paper has been "transformative" for some. "People find a new boldness about living life on their own terms—actually connecting to their heart's desire. How do they wish to live, and why don't they live that way now rather than postponing it?" In one case, it even helped prompt one high-ranking academic to quit her job and the city.

In December of 2017, Dr. Alison Green left her post as the pro vice-chancellor of Arden University. She had read the IPCC report warning that the world is nowhere near averting global temperature increases, as well as the 1,656-page National Climate Assessment on how climate change is now dramatically affecting our lives—and then she read Bendell's paper.

All three combined to put her on the road to a drastic life change. "My desire is to get out of academia and to get out of the city. I tell people I’m heading for the hills," she tells me over the phone. "My plan is to get a smallholding and live more closely to nature."

Reading the paper, she says, helped to crystallize her increasing uneasiness about the pace and scale of climate change. "What was really striking about this paper is that a social scientist was saying—not just the wacky fringe, this is a professor at an established institution, with a track record—saying that he believed that collapse was inevitable."

"That," she adds, "had a profound effect on me."

She's not the only one. Bendell himself says that he is still working out how much he can reconcile his job as an academic with his newfound conclusions about the state of the future.

"I think the reason why my framing and my paper took off is that it’s maybe the first time a social scientist was saying these things categorically," he says. "We are seemingly in denial. It's time to break that taboo and have serious conversations about what we do now."

April 19, 2019 — A Full Moon arrives at 4:12am Pacific Time, in the final degree of Libra. This is the second Libra Full Moon of the year, offering a crescendo of energies after a compressed month of examining our relationships. With Uranus conjunct the Sun and opposite the Moon, it’s time to liberate and unstick from old patterns, while finding more genuine ways of relating. Our emotions could now erupt. If they do, it’s for the sake of recalibration. We’re facing old fears and aggressions with courage so we can make room for greater harmony, balance, and nuance.

Meanwhile, the Sun and Moon are squaring the Saturn-Pluto-South Node conjunction. The emphasis this month is truly on extracting and transforming whatever we’ve outgrown, within ourselves and our relationships. If we can open to any surprises or difficulties that arise, this period will feel cleansing rather than painful. We can trust whatever the Universe has in store for this powerful next phase.

As old structures, systems, relationships, and familiar patterns dissolve and change all around us, we might be feeling caught in pain or overwhelm. But we can trust that we’re simply making room for a new paradigm to take root and blossom. This period truly requires us to step into our roles as compassionate warriors, mustering the strength to hold ourselves upright, root down to the Earth, and fiercely love ourselves and each other. Together we’re going to create a better world.

On this Libra Full Moon, may we find the courage to face and release the past. May we establish our anchors by holding hands and celebrating the Earth, ensuring a brighter future brimming with love, equilibrium, and peace.

QAIM, Iraq — The Islamic State (IS) might have lost all its territory in Iraq and Syria, but its ideology has not been defeated. Al-Qaeda may be able to exploit this situation and stage a comeback, taking advantage of its local roots along the Iraqi-Syrian border.

Though al-Qaeda and IS have fought each other across the border in Deir ez-Zor, most Iraqis use the two terms interchangeably, since the local branch, al-Qaeda in Iraq, eventually morphed into what is now known as IS.

In Syria, many acknowledge that there is scant difference between the two groups when it comes to ideology and oppressive methods. Yet many see al-Qaeda-linked groups as more locally rooted. Various opposition groups have even allied with them at times in an attempt to bring down the Syrian regime.

Qaim's Col. Moussa Hamad al-Karbouly, however, summed up the difference as follows. IS "used religion for military ends, while al-Qaeda used military means for religious ends," making it more amenable to those disillusioned with IS.

Karbouly is a former police officer and head of the Aaly al-Furat Brigade, which is part of the local Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) in western Anbar. Al-Monitor has interviewed him several times before, including after the liberation of his city, and most recently on April 3 in Qaim.

His father was killed by relatives who joined al-Qaeda. Karbouly has long tracked local members of the two terrorist organizations.

Members of the Karbouly tribe have been important IS leaders, including Omar al-Karbouly, who, as Al-Monitor reported last year, worked "closely with Abu Moussa al-Zarqawi as a top-level leader starting in 2003" and was captured in 2018 by Iraqi intelligence forces.

Karbouly told Al-Monitor he had seen Omar in a market in Fallujah in 2008 and “grabbed him and put a gun to his head, handing him over to the police there. But he bribed them to get out and then bombed my home.”

He told Al-Monitor the names of local IS members who he said "did not take part in recent battles" and who he thinks are likely to return to their roots in al-Qaeda.

"We have information that al-Qaeda is operating" in the area again, he said, mentioning local leaders Tariq Khalif Assi al-Karbouly and Adnan Sharif.

"They were al-Qaeda leaders who did not take part in recent IS battles," he added.

"Tariq al-Karbouly, a.k.a. Abu Ahmed, joined al-Qaeda in 2005," he told Al-Monitor. He was soon "detained for five years in Camp Bucca. He tried to escape several times. After his release he returned to making [improvised explosive devices] and has a great deal of experience in the field."

Some of them have left their families and fled to the Iraqi desert, Karbouly said.

"Their families are now staying in the al-Hawl camp after being in the Baghouz region, where having their families was a problem for them," he said. "Now that their families are safe in the camps, the fighters can move more freely and faster."

Alleged IS supporters in the Iraqi town of Tarmiya, meanwhile, grieved the death of a Syrian fighter with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The fighter, known as Abu Ishaq al-Ahwazi, was killed in January in an attack attributed to IS, according to a security source from the town. (Counterterrorism expert Hisham al-Hashimi has called Tarmiya "the center of Salafi recruiting in the Baghdad area.")

Ahwazi had in recent years joined the SDF to return to his native Deir ez-Zor and to continue fighting IS, though his friends told Al-Monitor he supported al-Qaeda's ideology until his death. He was known for being "the first in his area of Deir ez-Zor to fight against IS," allegedly by killing two Tunisian fighters, area natives told Al-Monitor.

He had been a Syrian regime officer prior to joining the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

This correspondent interviewed Ahwazi several times during his years as an FSA commander, including when he fought in Idlib and northern Syria after the FSA was forced to withdraw from Deir ez-Zor. He repeatedly praised former al-Qaeda leader Abu Maria al-Qahtani, calling him a "hero."

Abu Maria al-Qahtani, an ex-policeman from Mosul whose real name is Maysar al-Jabouri, served on the Shura Council of Syria's al-Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al-Nusra. He advocated early on for its split from IS.

Photos of Ahwazi in military attire continue to be used as profile photos by many from his area. It seems even Iraqis in former al-Qaeda strongholds grieved his death.

Meanwhile, in the eastern part of Syria now under the control of the SDF, local Arab sources have repeatedly told this correspondent that many IS fighters were "rehabilitated" and later used in the ranks of the SDF. This has prompted anger among many in an area that suffered a major tribal massacre after an uprising against IS.

Al-Qaeda may find the border area fertile ground once more, given its history of local recruitment during the post-2003 insurgency. Furthermore, some locals are aggrieved at the Kurdish-led forces, whom they see as "invaders" of Arab lands. Locals are also disillusioned with IS, and they reject Syrian regime control — all important factors in considering the potential for an al-Qaeda comeback.

The SDF has stressed that it cannot handle the multitudes in its jails, even before tens of thousands of IS fighters, supporters and their families were unexpectedly found in an area where "not more than a few hundred" were thought to have been holed up.

One longstanding source, who travels frequently between northern Iraq and eastern Syria, and is known to be in contact with the international coalition, told Al-Monitor that Kurdish leaders from eastern Syria have prevented the international coalition from discussing providing support to Arab groups in their local areas who are not subordinate to the SDF.

An attack in late March on regime positions near Shuheil — an al-Qaeda stronghold even before 2011 — was said to have been the first in eastern Syria to be claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked group in almost five years.

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and other groups with previous or current links to al-Qaeda, meanwhile, remain strong in Idlib, where millions of internally displaced people from other areas of Syria are struggling to survive. Abu Maria al-Qahtani is thought to be in Idlib.

If former al-Qaeda commanders with experience and local knowledge were to "go back to their roots" and shift to the Iraqi-Syrian border area, where competing forces at times create grievances and confusion, areas hit hard by IS and the battles to defeat it may see fluid alliances among outlaws, and those with little to lose may switch back to al-Qaeda.

Karbouly expects this to occur "within months."
Washington (CNN) Congressional Democratic leaders -- outraged over the Trump administration's rollout of special counsel Robert Mueller's report -- are calling on Mueller to publicly testify before Congress, renewing demands for the entire report to be released and raising concern over the President's conduct detailed in the report.

In a move that sets up a clash between the Trump administration and Congress, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler issued a subpoena on Friday for the full report , giving the Justice Department until May 1 to comply.

"My Committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice," Nadler said in a statement. "The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case. Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates. It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward."

When asked at a news conference Thursday if the Mueller report would provide a "road map" should Democrats open impeachment proceedings, Nadler said it was "too early" to discuss that, but then said the special counsel "probably" wrote the report with that "intent."

In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer similarly drew a distinction between the words of Attorney General William Barr and special counsel Robert Mueller on the question of whether the President obstructed justice.

"The differences are stark between what Attorney General Barr said on obstruction and what Special Counsel Mueller said on obstruction," the Democratic leaders said in their statement, adding, "As we continue to review the report, one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller's report appears to undercut that finding."

Pelosi and Schumer broadly criticized Barr earlier in the day on Thursday, accusing him of creating "a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality" and saying public testimony from Mueller himself in both the House and the Senate is "the only way to begin restoring public trust."

The call was echoed by Nadler, who posted to Twitter a copy of a letter to Mueller requesting testimony in front of the committee "as soon as possible" and "no later than May 23, 2019."

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff also announced that his committee has invited Mueller "to testify on the counterintelligence investigation." A letter from Schiff to Mueller states that the committee will work "to secure a mutually agreeable date in May."

During his Thursday morning news conference, Barr said he has "no objection" to Mueller testifying when asked if he would allow Mueller to testify publicly to Congress in light of the calls from Democrats.

Barr has blocked from public view portions of the report, including grand jury material, sensitive intelligence material, details about ongoing investigations, and information that harms the "privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties."

Democrats have slammed what they say are orchestrated attempts by the Trump administration to control the narrative surrounding the report's release. Prior to the report's release, they had also threatened to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain the full report if necessary, which may lead to a contentious court battle.

The Mueller report is the result of a nearly two-year investigation into how Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help the Trump campaign and whether the President then obstructed that probe. Mueller brought criminal charges against 25 Russians who interfered in the election and six Trump associates: senior campaign officials Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, national security adviser Michael Flynn, former fixer Michael Cohen, longtime ally Roger Stone and campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.

During his news conference, Barr said the President has been right all along on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in interfering with the 2016 presidential election. "As he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion," Barr said.

Republicans claim vindication for the President

Some Republican allies of the President in Congress immediately seized upon the attorney general's initial announcement to claim exoneration.

Rep. Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tweeted , "No collusion! No obstruction!"

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy issued a statement saying, "Nothing we saw today changes the underlying results of the 22-month long Mueller investigation that ultimately found no collusion," and adding, "it is time to move on."

House GOP Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to apologize for "making outlandish claims about the President" and said in a statement that "while Washington Democrats hoped for the special counsel to deliver a collusion conclusion, this report instead delivered a death blow to their baseless conspiracy theories."

Democrats zero in on obstruction question

But the fallout from the report is far from over.

Some Democrats quickly zeroed-in on the episodes that Mueller examined concerning the President related to potential obstruction of justice.

Barr said that he concluded that "the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense." He said that Trump, amid "relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability," was "frustrated and angered" that the probe undercut his presidency but that the White House still "fully cooperated" with it.

But Democrats rejected the attorney general's analysis.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, called it "ridiculous."

"Congress will be eager to analyze the ten (10) separate episodes of obstruction that AG Barr was so eager to contradict. But the argument that Trump lacked the intent to obstruct because he was 'frustrated and angry' is ridiculous," Raskin tweeted.

Democrats are also taking issue with the fact that Barr said during his news conference that counsel for the President had the chance to review the redacted report before its public release.

"Earlier this week, the President's personal counsel requested and was given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released," Barr said.

Following the news conference, Pelosi said on Twitter, "AG Barr has confirmed the staggering partisan effort by the Trump Admin to spin public's view of the #MuellerReport -- complete with acknowledgment that the Trump team received a sneak preview. It's more urgent than ever that Special Counsel Mueller testify before Congress."

Many Democrats believed that Barr would mishandle the special counsel's investigation before he was even confirmed, pointing out that he had previously written that Mueller's obstruction of justice inquiry was flawed.

Their doubts deepened when he became attorney general. In March, he released a memo announcing that he and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein determined that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that Trump committed an obstruction-of-justice offense, while also acknowledging that Mueller did not exonerate the president.

Barr then said in a congressional hearing that "spying did occur" against the 2016 Trump campaign, a claim that Trump's reelection team then used to inaccurately assert that the attorney general had said he believed the Obama administration had illegally surveilled the President.

CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday intensified its crackdown on Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, rolling back Obama administration policy and announcing new restrictions and sanctions against the three countries whose leaders national security adviser John Bolton dubbed the “three stooges of socialism.”

“The troika of tyranny — Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua — is beginning to crumble,” Bolton said in a hard-hitting speech near Miami on the 58th anniversary of the United States’ failed Bay of Pigs invasion of the island, an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government.

The measures seem likely to hit hardest in Cuba, which is at a moment of severe economic weakness as it struggles to find cash to import basic food and other supplies following a drop in aid from Venezuela and a string of bad years in other key economic sectors.

Bolton announced a new cap on the amount of money that families in the United States can send their relatives in Cuba. The Obama administration had lifted limits on remittances, but the new limit will be $1,000 per person per quarter. Remittances to Cuba from the United States amounted to $3 billion in 2016, according to the State Department.

Washington also moved to restrict “non-family travel” after a broad loosening of so-called purposeful visits under Obama led to soaring numbers of American trips for cultural and educational exchanges. Details on the restrictions were not immediately clear, but tourism is a key lifeline of hard currency for Cuba. Bolton called such visits “veiled tourism.”

Bolton spoke hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new policy allowing lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution. The United States has enforced a trade embargo against Cuba since the early 1960s.

Cuban officials met the announcements with defiance.

“Nobody will snatch away from us, neither through seduction nor force, ‘the Fatherland that our parents won for us by standing up,’” President Miguel Díaz-Canel said via Twitter. “We Cubans will not surrender.”

Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez called it an attack on international law, Cuban sovereignty and countries that would do business with the island: “Aggressive escalation by (hashtag)US against Cuba will fail. Like at Giron, we will be victorious,” he tweeted, referring to a Bay of Pigs beach where invaders landed.

“We will always be willing to have a dialogue based on absolute respect, but if the U.S. government has chosen a confrontational path we will not hesitate to defend the gains of the revolution at any cost,” Rodríguez later said on state television.

On Venezuela, Bolton said Washington was sanctioning the country’s Central Bank, which the Trump administration says has been instrumental in propping up the embattled government of President Nicolás Maduro. The sanctions do not bar humanitarian aid or private remittances and aim to ensure reliability of debit and credit card transactions, which have become essential amid skyrocketing inflation and a shortage of cash notes.

Maduro called the move the latest example of “imperialist aggression.” In a nationally broadcast TV appearance, he said any nation’s central bank is “sacred” and deserves respect.

“I see imperialism as crazy, desperate,” Maduro said.

Bolton also announced sanctions against financial services provider Bancorp, which he claimed is a “slush fund” for Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.

“The United States looks forward to watching each corner of this sordid triangle of terror fall: in Havana, in Caracas, and in Managua,” Bolton said in South Florida, which is home to many thousands of exiles and immigrants from the three countries.

He said Obama administration policies had given the Cuban government “political cover to expand its malign influence” across the region, including in Venezuela. Cuba has trained Venezuelan security forces to repress civilians and support Maduro, Bolton said, calling Maduro “quite simply a Cuban puppet.”

Bolton’s pledge to “never, ever abandon” the people of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua in their fight for freedom also might ring hollow in light of the historical events he sought to highlight at the event hosted by the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association.

Many Cuban Americans to this day resent the late President John F. Kennedy for not deploying American troops at a critical moment in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Meanwhile, with the high stakes of the Cold War a fading memory, some critics of U.S. policy toward Venezuela worry the Trump administration’s stance that all options are on the table, including a military one, to oust Maduro is an empty threat that will only serve to ignite the streets and geopolitical tensions with Russia, compounding the misery of Venezuelan citizens.

“Honoring one of U.S.′ greatest military fiascos from 60 years back suggests U.S. policy to Latin America owes more now to a perverse Cold War nostalgia than practical benefits for people of the region,” said Ivan Briscoe, the Latin American director for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.

Collin Laverty, president of Cuba Educational Travel, said in a statement that the measures on remittances and travel threaten the economic survival of Cuban families and the viability of thousands of independent small businesses allowed to operate since 2010 under reforms implemented by former President Raúl Castro.

“The only winners here are a handful of members of Congress and those stuck in the past that support them,” Laverty said. “The losers are millions of Cubans on and off the island and the overwhelming majority of Americans that support engagement with Cuba.”

Many of the 400 or so who paid $100 to attend Bolton’s speech at the Biltmore in South Florida were of Cuban descent. Rafael UsaTorres, a member of the 2506 Brigade that worked for the CIA at the time of the invasion, said he has faith the measures will bring down Díaz-Canel’s government, though he wished it had been done sooner.

“Today is a big day,” the 78-year-old said. “But I feel very sad — too many years waiting.”

Others said Washington isn’t going far enough. Manuel Menendez-Pou, 79, said the Cuban government had confiscated some $63 million in property from his family, once one of the wealthiest on the island, mainly in the sugar industry.

“The problem is not the money,” Menendez-Pou, also a former member of the brigade, said minutes before the speech. “They stole our life.”

In Havana, homemaker Odalis Salazar worried about the future of remittances she receives from two children living abroad, including one in the United States.

“It hurts everyone and Trump is absolutely criminal, because he knows that ... (the remittances) help us a lot,” Salazar said. “We Cubans have families there and we get by largely with that help that they send us.”

Pompeo’s decision on allowing lawsuits lets Americans, including Cubans who became naturalized citizens, sue companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties nationalized after Fidel Castro took power.

Pompeo said he would not renew a bar on litigation that has been in place for two decades, meaning lawsuits can be filed starting May 2, when the current suspension expires.

The Justice Department has certified roughly 6,000 claims as having merit, said Kimberly Breier, the top U.S. diplomat for the Americas. Those claims have an estimated value of $8 billion: $2 billion in property and $6 billion in interest, she said.

An additional 200,000 uncertified claims could run into the tens of billions of dollars, she said.

Breier said there would be no exceptions to the policy, but foreign companies “will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans.”

Nonetheless, companies in the European Union and Canadian companies stand to lose tens of billions in compensation and interest, and the decision prompted stern responses and vows to protect businesses from lawsuits.

In a statement, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland called the decision to remove the longstanding waivers “regrettable” and said it “can only lead to an unnecessary spiral of legal actions.”

In Spain, which has large investments in hotels and other tourism-related ventures on the island, a senior government official said Madrid would ask the EU to mount a challenge at the World Trade Organization.

“The extraterritorial application of the U.S. embargo is illegal and violates international law,” said Alberto Navarro, EU ambassador to Cuba.

Not too long ago, the conventional wisdom in mainstream Democratic circles was that Bernie Sanders was finished. He was too old and too stubborn; he reminded voters too strongly of an election they’d all like to forget. Sanders may have shocked observers (to say nothing of Hillary Clinton’s campaign) in 2016, but he was now yesterday’s news. A crowded field of nominees, moreover, had adopted the Vermont senator’s ideological playbook, making him just one of many candidates advocating for policies like Medicare for All and free college.

Today, however, Sanders is the Democratic frontrunner, leading all candidates in fundraising and trailing only an undeclared and hobbled Joe Biden in the polls—and Sanders has edged into the lead in at least one tracker. Facing Donald Trump in a general election and entering the White House in January of 2021 both seem increasingly possible, maybe even probable. “So far, the 2020 election is playing out exactly as Bernie Sanders had hoped,” The Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote on Wednesday. “And that has Sanders thinking with growing seriousness that this could very well end with his election as president.”



His opponents, many of whom are still stewing over the 2016 election, are also thinking about the growing possibility that Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. “From canapé-filled fundraisers on the coasts to the cloakrooms of Washington, mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by Mr. Sanders in a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016,” wrote The New York Times’s Jonathan Martin on Monday in a survey of the “Stop Sanders” movement’s developing strategy for halting the 77-year-old’s momentum.



But the comparisons to Donald Trump’s insurgent 2016 campaign are limited at best and facile at worst. Sanders’s most vocal opponents in the party are an assemblage of establishmentarians and familiar Beltway hands, none of whom speak for a political constituency of any size or significance. Moreover, far from hurting Sanders, this impotent assault is self-defeating, fueling the narrative that party gatekeepers want, at all costs, to keep a political revolution from taking over the Democratic Party.


The top two congressional Democrats demanded Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller testify to Congress about his investigation into President Trump, saying they don’t trust the attorney general to be fair.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Attorney General William P. Barr has made several bungles that have surrendered his impartiality.

“We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the special counsel’s investigation is for special counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible. The American people deserve to hear the truth,” they said.

Mr. Mueller, as special counsel, reports to Mr. Barr and submitted his final report to the attorney general late last month.

Mr. Barr is slated to give a press conference Thursday morning then make a redacted version of the report public. He’s also said he will testify to Congress about the report and his decisions early next month.

Democrats say his moves appear to be efforts to shape public opinion in favor of Mr. Trump.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Given the anxiety in Taiwan about a possible return of a controversial American passenger in May, EVA Air announced today that the passenger had recently died in Thailand.

EVA Air said that the man had died in early March of this year in Ko Samui, Thailand, reported Apple Daily. The cause of death was listed as "an illness" and the airline is now working on refunding his family members for the cost of his unused ticket for May.

On Jan. 19, an American man who is estimated to weigh 200 kilograms, boarded an EVA Air flight by wheelchair and insisted that a female flight attendant help him lower his underwear and wipe his buttocks while sitting on a toilet. The flight attendant was deeply traumatized by the incident and shared her frustrations about the episode on Facebook, before speaking to the press on Jan. 21.

During the press conference on Jan. 21, the flight attendant said that at about two and a half hours into a 14 hour flight, the passenger said he needed to use the restroom. He told her that he had recently had surgery on his right hand and asked her if she could help him stand up after relieving himself.

One minute after three female flight attendants assisted him in entering the business-class restroom, he said his underwear had only been pulled down halfway and he had no way of going to the bathroom. He then asked the flight attendant if she could help lower his underwear.

She initially refused, but he insisted that he was only able to pull down the front of his underwear and would soon soil himself. She placed a blanket to cover his genitals, but he slapped her hand and demanded that she take away the blanket and pull his underwear down.

When the flight attendant described pulling down his underwear, she began to cry. After finishing defecating, he told the flight attendant open the door because he said he had trouble breathing, but she refused.

He then said that he was finished and asked the flight attendant to wipe his buttocks. She refused, but he insisted that she had promised to do so and refused to leave until someone did.

With nearly 12 hours left in the flight, she then put on gloves and reluctantly helped him clean his backside. During this process she said he moaned, "Oh um, deeper, deeper."

He continued to insist she repeat the wiping. He then told her to pull his underwear back on and she felt she had no recourse but to comply.

On Jan. 26, it was reported that despite the traumatic episode, the repugnant rider was able to book yet another ticket on EVA Air for May, horrifying the airline's flight attendants. Later that day, an EVA employee, who spoke to SETN on condition of anonymity, revealed that the man indeed was on the blacklist.

EVA Air later notified the man's attorney that it would not be taking him as a passenger. After an apparent followup with the man's legal counsel, the airline was informed of his death.

In this gaming market update, the Investing News Network looks at Q1 2019 trends that are setting the tone for the industry for the year.









The first quarter of the year started off strong in the games market, with big companies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) jumping in. The global games market is projected to generate revenues of US$150 billion in 2019.

Major industry player Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) was also in the news with the launch of its new title “Apex Legends.” Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings (OTC Pink:TCTZF,HKEX:0700) made a soft launch of its much anticipated digital game store on a global scale.

On that note, the Investing News Network (INN) is taking a look back on the first quarter of the year to discover what the biggest trends in the gaming sector were and what things to look forward to for the rest of the year.

Gaming market update: Industry shows strength

In an email statement to INN, Guilherme Fernandes, marketing consultant at Newzoo, said that the biggest news of the first quarter includes the aforementioned entry of Google and Apple into the sector.

In March, Google announced Stadia, a new platform that aims to deliver instant access to games on gadgets like laptops, tablets and mobile devices.

Phil Harrison, vice president of Google Stadia, said in a blog post that the new service “will free players from the limitations of traditional consoles and PCs.”

Also making its entry into the market was Apple. In late March, the California-based company launched Apple Arcade, which the company says is the first game subscription service targeting platforms like mobile and desktops.

In a release, Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, said that the company is targeting “players of all ages” with the service.

“The App Store is the world’s biggest and most successful game platform. Now we are going to take games even further with Apple Arcade,” Schiller said.

The first quarter also saw an expansion from Tencent in terms of its presence in the market and product offerings. The Asian tech giant rolled out its digital games store on a global scale under the brand WeGame X. As of April, the store hosted 30 games on its platform.

In terms of its product portfolio, Tencent has been involved with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for Instant Play, which allows players to log into a game from any device and any location. Additionally, the company is working with Unity for Tencent Cloud, a cloud service that seeks to deliver secure and stable products, with a scheduled launch sometime this year.

“The ultimate goal of developing several alternative projects is to foster internal competition until one emerges victorious,” Fernandes said on Tencent’s expansion. “The largest games company in the world is also working with Activision to create ‘Call of Duty Mobile.’”

Benji Sales, host of a self-named YouTube channel and founder of the State of the Industry podcast, said in an email statement to INN that the first quarter presented a mixed bag for the industry.

“Q1 featured many very strong performances in the industry, as well as several that seem to have missed expectations,” he said.

Sales said that the launch of “Apex Legends” was one of the highlights of the quarter. The game was released by EA and Respawn Entertainment in February and quickly hit the 50 million players mark in its first month.

“’Apex Legends’ came out as a strong competitor to Epic’s ‘Fortnite’ in the battle royale genre and seemed to overperform seemingly all expectations,” Sales said. “This is actually a faster rate of growth than what ‘Fortnite’ began with.”

Fernandes said that the game was the “biggest surprise” of the quarter owing to EA’s marketing strategy, which relied on gamers for the marketing of the game.

“EA is known for its AAA games, with heavy marketing for months, if not years, before the release of its titles,” Fernandes said. “Given that it is free to play, people just jumped in, and the game’s quality spoke for itself, garnering very positive reactions from both community and critics.”

Fernandes said that the success of the game could potentially lead to the strategy being used more often in the future.

While EA hit a home run with “Apex Legends,” Sales said that the company missed expectations with the underperformance of its flagship AAA title, “Anthem.”

“The game had an extended development and hit numerous roadblocks, resulting in what must be a considerable budget,” he said. “EA’s expectations for the title was to sell 5 to 6 million units by the end of Q1 or in six weeks from its launch. That number, however, is looking doubtful that [EA] will attain it.”

Gaming market update: More games and consoles on the horizon

Moving forward, Sales said that the industry should be paying close attention to “Mortal Kombat 11” from NetherRealm Studios.

“The ‘Mortal Kombat’ series has become a juggernaut over the last few instalments and fan excitement seems very strong around this title,” he said. “I believe it will be the best selling title of Q2.”

Additionally, Sales said that Sony’s (NYSE:SNE,TSE:6758) PlayStation 4 (PS4) exclusive “Days Gone” should also be closely observed by the industry.

“Sony has a strong history of seeing large sales numbers around their exclusive titles,” he said. “Games like ‘Horizon Zero Dawn,’ ‘God of War’ and ‘Spider-Man’ have seen huge sales numbers on the PS4 and I’m sure the company is hoping ‘Days Gone’ will join that list and become a future multi-entry franchise for them.”

With the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) scheduled for June, Fernandes said that the gaming industry could be packed with multiple announcements in Q2.

“Despite notable absentees (like Sony), a great deal of announcements have been promised, including more information on Xbox’s Project xCloud,” he said. “Even Google and Sony are expected to make some announcements around the same time as E3.”

Both Fernandes and Sales highlighted the launch of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) potential disc-free Xbox console as a crucial step for the sector. The console could launch in May and possibly pave a new path in the industry, although it hasn’t officially been confirmed by the company.

“It will be interesting to see how it is received by the public and how it sells,” Fernandes said. “It serves as a stepping stone between traditional console gaming and cloud gaming, while people are still unsure about giving up ownership of their games and the hardware.”

If this console is released, it will synergize well with Project xCloud, a streaming service that Microsoft has been working on like its competitors. The official launch of the service is slated for late 2019.

“It will be interesting to watch the performance of the console as publishers push more and more into driving consumers to digital adoption,” Sales said.

Gaming market update: Esports generating attention

Fernandes highlighted that esports has been generating a lot of attention, with new sponsorships and partnerships.

“The amount of investment currently made in esports ought to deserve a closer look by anyone interested in such ventures,” he said. “It is not only [from a] teams, leagues and games perspective, but also in what concerns whole cities and regions as they compete to become the new capital for esports in their area.”

Looking ahead, Fernandes said that the industry could be witnessing one of the biggest transactions this year with the sale of Nexon (TSE:3659), the fourth-largest Japanese gaming company.

“It will be very interesting to see how the sale process of Nexon unfolds, given that some estimates say it could sell for over US$10 billion, which would make it the largest transaction in the games industry ever,” he said.

Meanwhile, Sales has placed his bet on Nintendo (OTC Pink:NTDOF,TSE:7974) owing to the company’s scheduled launch of several titles, including “Pokemon Sword,” “Pokemon Shield” and the remake of 1993’s “Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening,” all for the Nintendo Switch console. As noted in INN’s top gaming stocks article, the Switch was the best selling console in the first three months of the year.

“[We] should see tremendous growth as the strength of releases is much stronger, as well as the console likely seeing its first major price promotions and price cuts,” he said.

Sales said that existing consoles from Microsoft and Sony could be heading for price cuts as these companies are looking to launch new variants in the coming months.

“There is a strong chance we see at least one of these companies announce their next generation platforms and plans this year, for a launch in 2020,” he said. “So, it will be important to see what their strategies are around these consoles.”

Gaming market update: Cloud gaming as a business model

Sales expects Microsoft to further push into the services model through the likes of Xbox Game Pass and Backwards Compatibility for its Xbox console in a massive way. The Xbox Game Pass allows unlimited access to popular Xbox One and Xbox 360 games, while Backward Compatibility lets players play classic games on the Xbox One through its cloud platform.

With more companies getting into digital games and services, Sales said that those associated with physical games might see a loss as the industry adapts to new trends.

“I also expect physical-based games and companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), whose business revolves around physical media, to continue to see significant loss of market share as digital platforms and games become the industry standard,” he said.

However, Fernandes believes the launch of subscription services by various players could hurt the industry as consumers are confronted with too many subscription options. Fernandes compared the growth of subscription services in the gaming industry with that of the entertainment industry.

“A similar phenomenon is developing in the games industry, not only in terms of subscription services and game passes, competing for users’ leisure time, but also with the requirement of installing multiple clients and launchers on PC, as new competitors enter the market and attempt to disrupt Steam’s longstanding dominance,” he said.

Ferandes believes that such services will not be sustainable and that players will end up picking one service over other rivals.

Gaming market update: Investor takeaway

As marked by the entry of big tech giants and with the existing players launching new titles and consoles, the industry offers plenty of opportunities for investors and gamers.

Special counsel Robert Mueller provides an extensive recounting of how President Trump and his aides handled the fallout of the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Russians and senior campaign officials.

The report, citing interviews with former White House communications officials Hope Hicks and Josh Raffel, says Trump directed aides on multiple occasions not to publicly disclose emails setting up the meeting. Later, the report affirms that Trump himself dictated a misleading statement to the press, saying the meeting primarily discussed adoption.

The report describes White House officials learning — sometimes with shock — about the meeting. For example, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus first learned about the meeting in late June 2017 from Fox News host Sean Hannity (the report does not say how Hannity learned of it).

Hicks recalls being “shocked” by the emails setting up the meeting, concerned they looked “really bad.” Together with senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Hicks discussed the emails with Trump, who told the group “he did not want to know about it” and refused to hear details of the matter. He said he was confident the emails would never leak.

When Trump learned the New York Times was working on a story about the Trump Tower meeting, Trump initially directed Hicks not to comment — which she said was odd, according to Mueller, “because he usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin.”

Later, when Hicks showed Trump a draft statement about the meeting attributed to his son, the President deemed it too revealing. He told Hicks "to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption."

Trump Jr. expressed concern about that statement, however, insisting the word “primarily” be inserted to suggest the meeting included other topics aside from just adoption.

"Boss man worried it initiates a lot of questions," Hicks wrote back to Trump Jr. Ultimately the statement was released with the world "primarily" included.

In his report, Mueller describes finding at least three occasions when Trump directed Hicks or others not the publicly disclose information about the Trump Tower meeting. Ultimately, however, Mueller determines that Trump’s efforts were only directed at keeping information from the press.

He says they would only amount to obstructive action if there were attempts to withhold the information from congressional investigators or the special counsel’s office.
The UFC Fight Pass streaming service has started to dig into boxing a bit more, airing Roy Jones Jr-promoted cards and recently adding Lou DiBella’s popular Broadway Boxing series, and on June 19, they’ll have the first world title fight.

The vacant WBO super flyweight title will be on the line on June 19, as Kazuto Ioka faces Aston Palicte at Osaka Prefectural Gym in Osaka, Japan.

Ioka (23-2, 13 KO) is a former three-division titleholder, winning belts at 105, 108, and 112. In 2017, he announced his retirement from the sport, but returned to the ring last September at 115 pounds, beating McWilliams Arroyo on HBO. On Dec. 31, he faced Donnie Nietes for the vacant WBO title, with Nietes winning a decision in Macau.

Palicte (25-2-1, 21 KO) also fought Nietes for that vacant belt last September, on the same HBO card that featured Ioka’s return. In a fight that pretty much everyone felt Nietes had won, the judges came back with a draw. In January, Palicte beat Jose Martinez in an eliminator to earn another crack at the belt.

The title is vacant again because Nietes chose to vacate the title instead of face Palicte a second time, with Nietes looking instead for bigger money fights.

Palicte, promoted by Roy Jones Jr, will get his shot anyway, as he should by the rules and all that.

“I’m very excited for this second opportunity to fight for a world title,” he said. “I and the whole team learned a lot from the last draw and made adjustments, which, I think, were very effective.

“Since a rematch with Nietes will probably never take place, going against Ioka, who lost to him via a split decision, is probably the closest thing to redeeming myself after that draw. We’ve already planned out our training camp, which includes altitude training in Baguio. More than anything, I’m very excited to get into the ring again to hopefully deliver to my RJJ Boxing family its first world title.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Visual China Group Co Ltd, the largest Chinese stock images provider, said on Thursday that a subsidiary has been fined by internet authorities, days after it falsely claimed copyright of prominent images.

Internet authorities in China's Tianjin city slapped a fine of 300,000 yuan ($44,720) on the company for violating the country's cyber security laws, Visual China said in a filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange.

On Friday, Visual China, which partners with U.S. photo agency Getty Images, shut its website and apologized after it falsely claimed copyright of images such as the first photo of a black hole and China's national flag. The news had caused its shares to slump by the maximum 10 percent daily limit.

On Thursday, its shares closed 4.4 percent lower, lagging the performance of broader Chinese stock indices.

Malogam had five residents but only one registered voter this time - Sokela Tayang.

In the fading afternoon light, Gammar Bam glanced down nervously at a fast-flowing river in a corner of northeastern India. His team had already driven eight hours on one-lane mountainous roads and shaky bridges. Now they were trekking on a slippery path hugging a cliff.

Mr Bam looked at the narrow track and tried to gauge if he could clamber over an uprooted tree while carrying a voting machine. Somehow, he would have to make it work.

The world's largest electoral exercise began this month in India and will take place in seven phases over a 38-day period. Results will be announced on May 23. Nearly 900 million people are eligible to vote, and India is committed to reaching them all, no matter where they live.

For Mr Bam and his team of polling officers, that meant a four-day journey of over 300 miles - to ensure a single voter in Arunachal Pradesh could cast her vote.

"There is both excitement and nervousness," said Rupak Tamang, one of the team members, as he set up the voting machines. "If the one voter turns up, there will be 100 percent voting, but if she doesn't, then it will be zero percent."

Conducting elections in the world's largest democracy is a herculean task. Every five years, when national polls are held, the Election Commission grapples with challenging terrain, inclement weather and poor infrastructure to ensure that no voter who wants to cast a ballot is left out.

"We want to make elections as participative as possible," said Ashok Lavasa, one of the three election commissioners. "This is a manifestation of democracy's deep roots in India."

Rules mandate that no voter should have to travel more than 1.24 miles to vote.

Conducting elections in the world's largest democracy is a herculean task. Rules mandate that no voter should have to travel more than 1.24 miles to vote.

In Gujarat, a team will cross a lion-infested jungle to find a single voter. In the region of Ladakh, high in the Himalayan mountains, teams will be airlifted before trekking for one day with oxygen cylinders to reach voters. On the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the teams braved crocodile swamps for nine voters.

The lengths to which India goes to reach voters is a reflection of its commitment to universal franchise: Unlike in the United States, all adults in India have had the right to vote since the country's first election.

To conduct the poll, the Election Commission relies on more than 11 million government employees and security personnel who temporarily become election officials. Mr Bam, a 35-year old engineer in Arunachal Pradesh, the country's most sparsely populated state, was one of them. His task: to set up a polling booth in Malogam, a remote hamlet in forested mountains close to the border with China and more than 1,600 miles from New Delhi.

According to the last census, conducted in 2011, Malogam had five residents but only one registered voter this time - Sokela Tayang.

The journey of Mr Bam's team began two days before the first phase of the election on April 11. They started in Hawai, the district headquarters, a small town nestled high in the mountains at an altitude of 3,600 feet.

They carried two sets of voting machines, a thick sheaf of paperwork and utility items, like a bucket and battery-operated lamp.

They set out early the next morning, juddering over potholed roads overlooking a shimmering river valley.

The drive was only the start. In the late afternoon, they began trekking on a narrow forest path barely wide enough for one person. Mr Bam treaded lightly, deftly swatting wild overgrowth while keeping an eye out for snakes.

During the hike, a problem emerged. Locals told them that Sokela Tayang, the voter they had come all this way to meet, had left the area. But Mr Bam was not deterred: He decided to set up the polling booth closer to the road and try to get word to her through villagers.

They zeroed in on a ragged tin shed at the edge of the forest and borrowed rickety plastic chairs and cobwebbed tables from a nearby villager. A local administrator came by to review and approve the preparations.

By then, darkness had descended. The team walked to the nearest hutment - with no toilet, no electricity, no cellphone signal - to bunk down for the evening. They ate a simple meal of rice and lentils, then spent the night on a bamboo floor above a chicken pen. The next morning, the crowing of roosters woke them up at the crack of dawn: election day.

Mr Bam's team first had to conduct a mock poll at 5 a.m., per commission rules. The exercise is done for the benefit of candidates or their representatives to show that machines are working properly and no votes are already recorded. Even for a single voter, the practice poll required 50 mock votes. There would be no cutting corners.

The polling booth in the tin shed was open for business on time, at 7 a.m., the official start of voting across India.

The polling booth in the tin shed was open for business on time, at 7 a.m., the official start of voting across India.

Sokela Tayang did not disappoint. Like Mr Bam and his team, the 42-year-old farmer had also put in an effort to vote. Tending to her sick mother, 125 miles away, she returned to Malogam only to cast her ballot.

She arrived just after 8:30 a.m. She was offered a yogurt drink and asked to wait under the shade while they dealt with a last-minute glitch with the voting machine.

As an election official recorded video, Sokela Tayang walked into the shed, showed her identification card and had her finger dabbed with purple ink. She stepped behind a piece of plywood to cast her vote. The machine beeped loudly. It was over in less than two minutes.

She had some requests for her elected representatives. "We want to ask for jobs and development through our vote," Sokela Tayang said. Looking around at the surrounding wilderness with disappointment, she said, "Our area is still a jungle and needs to be developed."

After a round of selfies, she thanked the team for the trouble they had taken. But while Sokela Tayang's work was over within minutes, Mr Bam's task was far from finished. The polling booth was required to stay open until the official close of voting at 5 p.m. There was tedious paperwork to complete, including a 67-item checklist.

Now that Attorney General Bill Barr has released the Mueller report, there is a great hue and cry from Democrats.

They gripe that the attorney general redacted the material gathered by the special counsel’s grand jury.

Of course, the attorney general is following the law — grand jury proceedings, including all evidence and testimony presented before them, are secret. And for good reason.

By demanding the release of grand jury material, Democrats are asking the attorney general to violate the law, and are doing violence to an important bulwark that protects Americans from abuse by an all-powerful government.

Democrats used to care about civil liberties. But in their blind pursuit of power and political advantage over President Trump they have learned nothing and forgotten everything.

It wasn’t that long ago the shoe was on the other foot and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s grand jury was investigating President Clinton.

The independent counsel was required by law to produce a report. Democrats adamantly opposed releasing Starr’s report, chock full of salacious details.

They lost that particular fight, and following that debacle, Democrats relegated the office of the independent counsel with its public reports to the dustbin of history. Going forward in its stead, a “special” counsel would write a confidential report that would only be seen by the attorney general.

But now, the Democrats reverse course again and seek to end grand jury secrecy. Such a move would be devastating to the privacy rights of all Americans.

The grand jury differs in important ways from other juries, and represents a departure from the adversarial system that underlies American justice.

Unlike a regular jury, grand juries don’t hear both sides of a case. They only hear what the prosecutor wants them to hear. Prosecutors present witnesses before the grand jury to make the case they want to make. They lay out evidence as they see fit, then ask the grand jury to issue an indictment and bring charges against the defendant.

The witnesses the prosecutor presents to the grand jury are not cross-examined. There are no defense witnesses, nor are there defense attorneys present during grand jury proceedings. In many states, prosecutors are not required to present the grand jury with exculpatory evidence they have that would clear the defendant.

And there is a further departure from the norms we expect in the American criminal justice system.

Common criminals arrested for the most heinous crimes are told they have the right to remain silent, they have the right to an attorney and that anything they say can and will be used against them (the so-called Miranda warning).

Not so with witnesses before a grand jury. They cannot have their attorneys with them when they are being questioned, and they are never told they have the right to remain silent.

You can see how witnesses could easily be tripped up and end up saying something that results with them being charged with perjury or worse. They could be accused of crimes though they never had the chance to cross-examine their accusers.

Grand jury testimony could include all manner of hearsay, unverified rumors and even false allegations against innocent persons. That’s precisely why it’s kept secret.

Justice demands prosecutors not expose damaging information against someone who’s not charged with a crime.

And again, Democrats used to understand this. They used to lead the fight against overzealous prosecutors who abuse grand juries.

“The misuse of the grand jury process by prosecutors in the office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has again focused the spotlight on the need to protect ordinary Americans from this key facet of the criminal justice system that is so rife with abuse,” wrote Gerald Lefcourt, a noted liberal criminal defense attorney who defended the Black Panthers and served as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. (Lefcourt is no fan of Trump or Barr.)

Today, congressional Democrats behave like the prosecutors they used to criticize. They seek to exploit special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury for their own political ends and do away with safeguards that protect Americans from abuse.

By dispensing with the presumption of innocence, the privacy rights of Americans and even the electoral college, Democrats’ scorched earth policy against President Trump threatens our entire legal and constitutional system.

Sanders Responds After Trump Vetoes Yemen Resolution

BURLINGTON, Vt., April 16 – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement after President Donald Trump vetoed the resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen:

"I am disappointed, but not surprised, that Trump has rejected the bi-partisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in the horrific war in Yemen. The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs. My colleagues and I will continue our efforts to reassert Congress' constitutional responsibility over war making and end U.S involvement in unauthorized and unconstitutional wars."
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru’s former president Alan Garcia shot himself in the head on Wednesday to avoid arrest in connection with alleged bribes from Brazilian builder Odebrecht, taking his own life, in the most dramatic turn yet in Latin America’s largest graft scandal.

Garcia, a towering and charismatic figure who played a central role in Peruvian politics for more than three decades, died in a hospital at age 69 after shooting himself at his house in Lima when police arrived with a warrant for his arrest.

Garcia’s death shocked the Andean country that had watched his transition from a fiery leftist who was elected president at age 36 to a free-market crusader who won a second term in 2006.

A pugnacious politician considered one of Latin America’s best orators, Garcia had long been dogged by graft allegations that he brushed off as baseless political smears.

But prosecutors investigating Odebrecht gathered enough evidence to secure a judicial order this week to hold Garcia in pre-trial detention while they prepared charges against him, arguing that he might flee or obstruct their work.

Odebrecht, a family-owned construction conglomerate, spurred probes across Latin America after it admitted publicly in late 2016 that it had secured lucrative contracts in the region by bribing politicians. Former Odebrecht executives are now cooperating with prosecutors as informants.

The investigation in Peru had picked up speed in recent months, with a judge ordering another former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, to jail before trial in connection with the company last week.

The scandal had already touched the highest levels of Peru’s ruling political class. Ex-President Alejandro Toledo is fighting extradition from the United States after a Peruvian judge ordered him jailed in 2017, while another former leader, Ollanta Humala, spent nine months in pre-trial detention before he was released last year on appeal.

“Others might sell out, not me,” Garcia told a local broadcaster in some of his last public comments on Tuesday, repeating a phrase he used frequently as his political rivals became ensnared in the scandal in recent years.

He said in the interview that he was not afraid of the investigation because “I believe in life after death.”

A CLOSED DOOR, A SHOT HEARD

After police arrived at Garcia’s house to arrest him early on Wednesday, Garcia told them he had to call his attorney, Interior Minister Carlos Moran said.

“He entered a room and closed the door behind him,” Moran told a news conference shortly before Garcia’s death was confirmed. “Within a few minutes, a shot from a firearm was heard and police forcibly entered and found Mr. Garcia sitting with a wound in his head.”

Garcia’s supporters prepared for a wake at the headquarters of his once-powerful party APRA as condolences poured in from regional leaders, including Chile’s conservative Sebastian Pinera and Bolivia’s leftist Evo Morales.

“APRA never dies!” his supporters chanted to news cameras.

Garcia’s death will likely throw cold water on the Odebrecht probe in Peru. It may also deepen the divide between centrist President Martin Vizcarra and the rightwing opposition that controls Congress, where Garcia had influential allies.

Late last year, Garcia asked Uruguay for political asylum after he was banned from leaving the country while under investigation, calling Vizcarra a “dictator.” Uruguay rejected the request.

Some of Garcia’s supporters called his suicide a heroic act.

“Garcia made a decision as a free man. It was a decision of dignity and honor,” Mauricio Mulder, an APRA lawmaker, said in broadcast comments.

Vizcarra took office a year ago to replace Kuczynski after he resigned in a graft scandal, and has made fighting graft the centerpiece of his government. He has said he does not interfere in the constitutionally independent prosecutors’ office.

But criticism of the use of pre-trial detention in the Odebrecht probe has grown following several high-profile arrests in recent years.

In Peru, criminal suspects can be held in jail without trial for up to three years if prosecutors can show they have evidence that would likely lead to a conviction and the suspects would likely flee or obstruct their work if free.

The attorney general’s office announced an internal probe into lead prosecutors on the Odebrecht probe on Wednesday after Garcia’s supporters accused them of irregularities.

Vizcarra ordered flags flown at half staff and declared a three-day national period of mourning for Garcia. Garcia’s family members opted to break with protocol and not have Vizcarra or a government representative preside over his funeral, local media said.

It’s Time to ReBELL Against Tuesday Tradition

Because tacos are made for any day of the week.

For ages, we’ve been told to keep a particular day of the week on a taco pedestal. That one day is better than the others to enjoy tacos with your friends and family… but, why? “Because that’s how it’s always been done” is no longer a suitable answer. Times have changed. Society has changed.

As a brand, we have a responsibility to challenge status quo. To defend against calendar bias. To point out something so unjust, others don’t want us to talk about it (it’s a trademark thing – Google it). But you know how the saying goes: if you want to make a taco, you gotta bend some tortillas. So here it goes…

Taco Tuesday.

Sure, #TacoTuesday looks great when it comes to alliteration hashtags, but how do you think the other six days of the week feel?

You don’t have a Monday Mother. Or a Friday Friend. You make the moments count with those you love most -- no matter the day of the week. Tacos should be no exception. At Taco Bell we think it’s time to reBELL. To bond with friends over your love for soft, hard shell or Doritos Locos tacos any day of the week.

Tacos are TOO good to be shackled to just one day. Tacos should be for be ANY day.

So here’s to you Taco Monday. Good on ya Taco Wednesday. Taco Thursday, we see you. Taco Friday? Yup. Taco Saturday, Taco Sunday -- please and thank you.

It’s time for you and your friends to live every day like it’s Taco Tuesday.
The day after five burglars in the employ of a presidential re-election campaign were caught in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, a former cop named Tony Ulascewicz was called to a meeting on a park bench not far from the White House. Waiting for him were White House counsel John Dean and Herbert Kalmbach, the president's personal lawyer. The two lawyers wanted Ulascewicz to be the courier—"bagman," if you prefer, and I do—who would deliver tens of thousands of dollars worth of hush money, all in cash, to the families of the burglars.

Later, in an interview with Newsweek, Ulascewicz explained how such things worked in the days before the Internet and ATMs.

Dean wanted someone to distribute funds for humanitarian purposes to the burglars who were involved in this bungled affair. It wasn't hush money at the time. I was given the first $75,000 in a room at the Statler Hilton hotel in Washington. Mr. Kalmbach brought it up in an attache case. I had nothing to put it in, but in hotel rooms they have laundry bags, so I put it in one of those. Kalmbach told me that the phone calls I made to him should not be traceable. I ended up making a lot of long-distance telephone calls by cash from pay phones. Carrying around that many quarters and dimes would kind of pull your pants down, so when I saw a busman's money changer in a stationery store, I bought it to carry the change around.

Say what you will about the Nixon people, but they worked at their crimes. What we saw Thursday, when William Barr cemented his legacy as a hack in constitutional history, was one of the laziest attempts at a political cover-up you ever will see. Barr wasn't even trying hard, and it showed, most graphically, when he explained what he believes the El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago's motivation in this whole affair.

In assessing the President’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President’s personal culpability.

Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.

My god, what a complete tool this man is.

First of all, there was nothing "unprecedented" about the president*'s situation. Ask all the people who got ground up in Ken Starr's endless pursuit of Bill Clinton. (Susan McDougal might have a little something to say.)

Second, Barr seriously argued that the president* couldn't be expected to follow the law because he was frustrated and mad. If the president* obstructed justice, well, it was the media's fault.

Third, Barr seriously argued that a president* fired the FBI director and forced out his previous attorney general, in both cases because, in the president*'s fevered mind, they insufficiently protected him.

And, last, this president* doesn't "sincerely believe" anything. At least, not longer than five minutes at a time. This was living, breathing, writhing corruption, right there in front of god and the world. The only slight shard of integrity to be found was the fact that Robert Mueller wasn't there.

Trump was mad, so NO OBSTRUCTION! Adam Bettcher Getty Images

On October 20, 1973, shortly before he would be fired, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox called a press conference to explain why he would not be taking President Nixon up on the latter's offer to have Senator John Stennis vet the White House tapes.

I read a headline in one of the newspapers this morning that said, 'Cox Defiant.' But I don't feel defiant..."I'm not looking for a confrontation. I've worried a good deal through my life about problems of imposing too much strain upon our constitutional institutions, and I'm certainly not out to get the President of the United States. As you all know, there has been and is evidence—not proof, perhaps, in some instances, but clearly prima facie evidence—of serious wrongdoing on the part of high Government officials, wrongdoing involving an effort to cover up other wrongdoing. It appeared that the papers, documents and recordings of conversations in the White House, including the tapes, would be relevant to getting the truth about these incidents.

I'm referring not only to the Watergate incident itself, but to other things involving electronic surveillance, break ins at a doctor's office and the like. Last night we were told that the court order would not be obeyed, that the papers, memoranda and documents of that kind would not be provided at all. And that, instead of the tapes, a summary of what they showed would be provided. I think it is my duty as the special prosecutor, as an officer of the court and as the representative of the grand jury, to bring to the court's attention what seems to me to be noncompliance with the court's order.



Robert Mueller no longer works for William Barr's Department of Justice. It's time for Mr. Mueller to defend his own work, in public. It's time for that.

BuzzFeed News’ supposed “bombshell” alleging President Trump instructed his former personal attorney to lie to Congress has been effectively debunked following the release of the special counsel report Thursday morning.

There were already major problems with the BuzzFeed News story, most especially that special counsel Robert Mueller’s office itself issued an extremely rare public statement claiming the report was not “accurate.”

But Buzzfeed stuck to its guns. And now that the public has access to a redacted version of the findings of the shuttered two-year investigation, which included 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews, it seems all but certain that the BuzzFeed News “scoop” is, in fact, false.

The Jan. 18 report, titled, “President Trump Directed His Attorney Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress About The Moscow Tower Project,” alleged the president’s former attorney “told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.”

The report added that Mueller’s team “learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office,” claiming that the supposed revelation marked “the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.”

The BuzzFeed News report made it clear that the allegations came from anonymous individuals who were supposedly familiar with the Mueller investigation.

But here is what the actual Mueller report found after thousands and thousands of hours of investigating:

Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen’s testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did not direct him to provide false testimony.



Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the specifics of his planned testimony … [while there is evidence] that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen’s false testimony.

Now, this is on top of the special counsel’s office publicly refuting the story, alleging in a statement that the report's chief claims were not true.

“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” a spokesman said of the BuzzFeed News report.

Absurdly enough, even after Mueller’s office disputed the article, some in the press maintained that the denial was not actually a denial. Others criticized the Office of Special Counsel for challenging the reporting. Some even claimed the press was the real victim of the questionable reporting. BuzzFeed News, for its part, stood by its story.

However, following the release of the Mueller report, I am not sure how much longer the online news organization can continue to defend its reporting. I’m not sure if it even will continue to do that. Plenty of federal resources went into the Mueller investigation. For the BuzzFeed News story to be accurate, it would mean that two anonymous sources familiar with the investigation uncovered wrongdoing and that it either slipped past Mueller and his team of 40-plus agents or they have conspired to lie about it.

The idea that the report is simply false is much, much easier to believe.

Sérgio Conceição criticou a Liga por não ter dado mais tempo de descanso ao FC Porto.

Sérgio Conceição criticou a Liga por ter colocado o FC Porto a jogar no sábado e agora elogiou a atitude da Federação holandesa.

A Federação holandesa de Futebol (KNVB) anunciou que vai adiar todos os jogos da penúltima jornada da liga local para evitar que o Ajax jogue dois dias antes da meia-final da Champions contra o Tottenham, a 30 de abril.

Esta alteração implica que o Ajax tenha sete dias de descanso antes do jogo da Liga dos Campeões, mais quatro do que o Tottenham, que deve jogar no sábado, dia 27 de abril, contra o West Ham, para a liga inglesa.

Sérgio Conceição, treinador do FC Porto, reagiu nas redes sociais à notícia depois de ter criticado a decisão da Liga em ter colocado o jogo com o Santa Clara no sábado. Recorde-se que os dragões jogaram para a Liga dos Campeões na quarta-feira.

"Um bom exemplo a seguir. É importante ter em consideração os tempos de recuperação ideais dos atletas e definir, em conjunto, um calendário que proteja e promova o futebol português", pode ler-se no tweet do técnico.
New York City FC is excited to introduce the City Select League (CSL) which will commence play in fall 2019.

Launched in 2016 as the NYCFC Affiliate League, the expanded City Select League will now include more than 20 clubs across the Boys U-9 to U-12 age groups.

NYCFC Academy Director Sam Pugsley said: “With the U.S. Soccer Development Academy dropping the U-12 age group starting in the fall of 2019, we had a natural platform to expand our youth league to the U-12 age group, while also including a number of new clubs in the area. Moving forward, we’re confident that the City Select League will offer clubs in the broader Tri-State area an optimal competitive platform for player development and pathway.

“We’ve reached out to and chosen some very good clubs that will help facilitate the launch of the City Select League. They know and understand what we’re looking for and what the general philosophy and overall ethos of the league is.”

NYCFC Sporting Director Claudio Reyna added: “The City Select League came from NYCFC as a Club wanting to connect and have relationships with local youth soccer clubs in the area. We’ve done that from day one and for us it’s been very important to make sure our door is always open.

“Creating a competition that we oversee and manage will ensure it’s the right environment for youth players in the Tri-State area. It’s really unique amongst MLS teams and it is important to continue every year to develop more and more relationships with the local soccer community and this is one big step towards that.”

In its current form, the youth league consists of NYCFC’s seven affiliate clubs: Downtown United SC, Manhattan SC, Met Oval, New York Soccer Club, TSF, SUSA and World Class FC. Once the expanded league format commences this fall, additional local clubs will be involved throughout New York City, Long Island, Westchester County, Rockland County, Connecticut, and New Jersey.

At its core, the league enables young players to compete, learn and grow within the structure of Academy soccer. The City Select League concentrates on four main pillars:

Meaningful competition : Inclusion of top-level clubs in talent-rich areas

: Inclusion of top-level clubs in talent-rich areas Managing league format and structure: Prioritizes development with age-appropriate guidelines

Prioritizes development with age-appropriate guidelines Reduced travel and cost : Increases local competition with no team registration fee

: Increases local competition with no team registration fee Shared sporting values: Allows a transparent player pathway to professional soccer

Pugsley added: “The general ethos of the league has been to share common sporting values that maximize player development and we hope we can extrapolate that out to the wider group as we look to expand to the U-12s and include outside clubs.”

The League will be registered and operated under the New York Club Soccer League (NYCSL) structure. This provides a centralized platform for teams to register and creates fluidity for players in a club to move up and down age groups appropriately according to their individual development. Founded in 2009, NYCSL is fully sanctioned by US Club Soccer and is a platform for the New York area with over 1600 registered teams currently playing in multiple leagues.
Vincent van Gogh Corridor in the Asylum (1889)

A new dystopian novel in the classic mode takes the form of a dictionary of madness

The best dystopian literature, or at least the most effective, manages to show us a hideous and contorted future while resisting the temptation to point fingers and invent villains. This is one of the major flaws in George Orwells’s 1984: When O’Brien laughingly expounds on his vision of “a boot stamping on a human face—forever” he starts to acquire the ludicrousness of a Bond villain; he may as well be a cartoon—one of the Krusty Kamp counsellors in The Simpsons, raising a glass “to Evil.” Orwell’s satire of Stalinism, or Margaret Atwood’s on the religious right in The Handmaid’s Tale tend to let our present world off the hook a little by comparison. More subtle works, like Huxley’s Brave New World, are far more effective. His Controller, when interrogated, doesn’t burst out in maniacal laughter and start twiddling his moustache. He explains, in quite reasonable terms, why the dystopia he lives in is the best way to ensure the happiness of all—and he means it. Everything’s broken, but it’s not anyone’s fault; it’s terrifying because it’s so familiar.

Great dystopia isn’t so much fantasy as a kind of estrangement or dislocation from the present; the ability to stand outside time and see the situation in its full hideousness. The dystopian novel doesn’t necessarily have to be a novel. Maybe the greatest piece of dystopian literature ever written is Theodor Adorno’s Minima Moralia, a collection of observations and aphorisms penned by the philosopher while in exile in America during and after the Second World War. Even if, like I do, you disagree enthusiastically with his blanket condemnation of all “degenerated” popular culture, it’s hard not to be convinced that what we are living is “damaged life.” It’s not an argument so much as revelation. In Adorno’s bitterly lucid critique everything we take for

“The libidinal achievements demanded of an individual behaving as healthy in body and mind are such as can be performed only at the cost of the profoundest mutilation … the regular guy, the popular girl, have to repress not only their desires and insights, but even the symptoms that in bourgeois times resulted from repression.” – Minima Moralia

granted is suddenly revealed in all its hideousness. The world Adorno lives in isn’t quite the same as ours; he’s coming at his subjects from a reflex angle—they’re a bunch of average Joes and Janes, he’s a misanthropic German cultural theorist with a preternaturally spherical head—but his insights are all the more relevant because of this. Something has gone terribly wrong in the world; we are living the wrong life, a life without any real fulfillment. The newly published DSM-5 is a classic dystopian novel in this mold.



DSM-5

American Psychiatric Publishing

(991 pages) American Psychiatric AssociationDSM-5American Psychiatric Publishing(991 pages)

It’s also not exactly a conventional novel. Its full title is an unwieldy mouthful: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. The author (or authors) writes under the ungainly nom de plume of The American Psychiatric Association—although a list of enjoyably silly pseudonyms is provided inside (including Maritza Rubio-Stipec, Dan Blazer, and the superbly alliterative Susan Swedo). The thing itself is on the cumbersome side. Over two inches thick and with a thousand pages, it’s unlikely to find its way to many beaches. Not that this should deter anyone; within is a brilliantly realized satire, at turns luridly absurd, chillingly perceptive, and profoundly disturbing.

If the novel has an overbearing literary influence, it’s undoubtedly Jorge Luis Borges. The American Psychiatric Association takes his technique of lifting quotes from or writing faux-serious reviews for entirely imagined books and pushes it to the limit: Here, we have an entire book, something that purports to be a kind of encyclopedia of madness, a Library of Babel for the mind, containing everything that can possibly be wrong with a human being. Perhaps as an attempt to ward off the uncommitted reader, the novel begins with a lengthy account of the system of classifications used—one with an obvious debt to the Borgesian Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge, in which animals are exhaustively classified according to such sets as “those belonging to the Emperor,” “those that, at a distance, resemble flies,” and “those that are included in this classification.”

Just as Borges’s system groups animals by seemingly aleatory characteristics entirely divorced from their actual biological attributes, DSM-5 arranges its various strains of madness solely in terms of the behaviors exhibited. This is a recurring theme in the novel, while any consideration of the mind itself is entirely absent. In its place we’re given diagnoses such as “frotteurism,” “oppositional defiant disorder,” and “caffeine intoxication disorder.” That said, these classifications aren’t arranged at random; rather, they follow a stately progression comparable to that of Dante’s Divine Comedy, rising from the infernal pit of the body and its weaknesses (intellectual disabilities, motor tics) through our purgatorial interactions with the outside world (tobacco use, erectile dysfunction, kleptomania) and finally arriving in the limpid-blue heavens of our libidinal selves (delirium, personality disorders, sexual fetishism). It’s unusual, and at times frustrating in its postmodern knowingness, but what is being told is first and foremost a story.

This is a story without any of the elements that are traditionally held to constitute a setting or a plot. A few characters make an appearance, but they are nameless, spectral shapes, ones that wander in and out of view as the story progresses, briefly embodying their various illnesses before vanishing as quickly as they came—figures comparable to the cacophony of voices in The Waste Land or the anonymously universal figures of Jose Saramago’s Blindness. A sufferer of major depression and of hyperchondriasis might eventually be revealed to be the same person, but for the most part the boundaries between diagnoses keep the characters apart from one another, and there are only flashes. On one page we meet a hoarder, on the next a trichotillomaniac; he builds enormous “stacks of worthless objects,” she idly pulls out her pubic hairs while watching television. But the two are never allowed to meet and see if they can work through their problems together.

This is not to say that there is no setting, no plot, and no characterization. These elements are woven into the encyclopedia-form with extraordinary subtlety. The setting of the novel isn’t a physical landscape but a conceptual one. Unusually for what purports to be a dictionary of madness, the story proper begins with a discussion of neurological impairments: autism, Rett’s disorder, “intellectual disability”. The scene this prologue sets is one of a profoundly bleak view of human beings; one in which we hobble across an empty field, crippled by blind and mechanical forces whose workings are entirely beyond any understanding. This vision of humanity’s predicament has echoes of Samuel Beckett at some of his more nihilistic moments—except that Beckett allows his tramps to speak for themselves, and when they do they’re often quite cheerful. The sufferers of DSM-5, meanwhile, have no voice; they’re only interrogated by a pitiless system of categorizations with no ability to speak back. As you read, you slowly grow aware that the book’s real object of fascination isn’t the various sicknesses described in its pages, but the sickness inherent in their arrangement.

Who, after all, would want to compile an exhaustive list of mental illnesses? The opening passages of DSM-5 give us a long history of the purported previous editions of the book and the endless revisions and fine-tunings that have gone into the work. This mad project is clearly something that its authors are fixated on to a somewhat unreasonable extent. In a retrospectively predictable ironic twist, this precise tendency is outlined in the book itself. The entry for obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor insight describes this taxonomical obsession in deadpan tones: “repetitive behavior, the goal of which is […] to prevent some dreaded event or situation.” Our narrator seems to believe that by compiling an exhaustive list of everything that might go askew in the human mind, this wrong state might somehow be overcome or averted. References to compulsive behavior throughout the book repeatedly refer to the “fear of dirt in someone with an obsession about contamination.” The tragic clincher comes when we’re told, “the individual does not recognize that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.” This mad project is so overwhelming that its originator can’t even tell that they’ve subsumed themselves within its matrix. We’re dealing with a truly unreliable narrator here, not one that misleads us about the course of events (the narrator is compulsive, they do have poor insight), but one whose entire conceptual framework is radically off-kilter. As such, the entire story is a portrait of the narrator’s own particular madness. With this realization, DSM-5 starts to enter the realm of the properly dystopian.

This madness does lead to some startling moments of humor. One vignette describes in deadpan tones a scene at once touchingly pathos-laden and more than a little creepy: “He rubs his genitals against the victim’s thighs and buttocks. While doing this he fantasizes an exclusive, caring relationship with the victim.” The entry on caffeine intoxication disorder informs us, with every appearance of seriousness, that the diagnostic criteria include “recent consumption of caffeine” along with “1) restlessness 2) nervousness 3) excitement.” There are, occasionally, what seem to be surreal parodies of religious dietary regulations: “Infants and younger children […] eat paint, plaster, string, hair, or cloth. Older children may eat animal droppings, sand, insects, leaves, or pebbles.” What the levity of these moments masks, though, is the sense of loneliness that saturates the work.

The narrative voice of the book affects a tone of clinical detachment, one in which drinking coffee and paranoid-type schizophrenia can be discussed with the same flat tone. Under the pretense of dispassion this voice embodies a whole raft of terrifying preconceptions. Just like the neurological disorders that appear at the start of the book, mental illnesses appear like lightning bolts, with all their aura of divine randomness. Even when etiologies are mentioned they’re invariably held to be either genetic or refer to other illnesses such as substance abuse disorders. At no point is there any sense that madness might be socially informed, that the forms it takes might be a reflection of the influences and pressures of the world that surrounds us.

The idea emerges that every person’s illness is somehow their own fault, that it comes from nowhere but themselves: their genes, their addictions, and their inherent human insufficiency. We enter a strange shadow-world where for someone to engage in prostitution isn’t the result of intersecting environmental factors (gender relations, economic class, family and social relationships) but a symptom of “conduct disorder,” along with “lying, truancy, [and] running away.” A mad person is like a faulty machine. The pseudo-objective gaze only sees what they do, rather than what they think or how they feel. A person who shits on the kitchen floor because it gives them erotic pleasure and a person who shits on the kitchen floor to ward off the demons living in the cupboard are both shunted into the diagnostic category of encopresis. It’s not just that their thought-process don’t matter, it’s as if they don’t exist. The human being is a web of flesh spun over a void.

With this radical misreading, the American Psychiatric Association is following something of a precedent in the actual psychological professions. Sigmund Freud himself performs a similar feat of ostranenie in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, in which he appears to take the position of an alien observer of everyday affairs, noting that “the kiss […] is held in high sexual esteem among many nations in spite of the fact that the parts of the body involved do not form part of the sexual apparatus but constitute the entrance to the digestive tract.” If you’re going to make a properly objective study of human behavior, to some extent you have to disavow your own humanity. You have to ask, why kissing? Why do people press their mouths up against each other? In DSM-5 we can see a perverse mirror image of this kind of estrangement. Freud retreats to a position of inhuman detachment to ask questions. Here, the narrator does it to issue instructions.

The word “disorder” occurs so many times that it almost detaches itself from any real signification, so that the implied existence of an ordered state against which a disorder can be measured nearly vanishes is almost forgotten. Throughout the novel, this ordered normality never appears except as an inference; it is the object of a subdued, hopeless yearning. With normality as a negatively defined and nebulously perfect ideal, anything and everything can then be condemned as a deviation from it. Even an outburst of happiness can be

We’re told this consists of a prolonged period during which the sufferer’s mood “may be described as euphoric, unusually good, cheerful, or high” and in which “the person may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public places,” or—more distressingly, admittedly—“a salesperson may telephone strangers at home in the early morning hours to initiate sales”

diagnosed as a manic episode. And then there are the “not otherwise specified” personality disorder categories. Here all pretensions to objectivity fall apart and the novel’s carefully warped imitation of scientific categories fades into an examination of petty viciousness. A personality disorder not otherwise specified is the diagnosis for anyone whose behaviors “do not meet the full criteria for any one Personality Disorder, but that together cause clinically significant distress […] eg. social or occupational.” It’s hard not to be reminded of a few people who’ve historically caused social or occupational distress. If you don’t believe that people really exist, any radical call for their emancipation is just sickness at its most annoying.

If there is a normality here, it’s a state of near-catatonia. DSM-5 seems to have no definition of happiness other than the absence of suffering. The normal individual in this book is tranquilized and bovine-eyed, mutely accepting everything in a sometimes painful world without ever feeling much in the way of anything about it. The vast absurd excesses of passion that form the raw matter of art, literature, love, and humanity are too distressing; it’s easier to stop being human altogether, to simply plod on as a heaped collection of diagnoses with a body vaguely attached.

For all the subtlety of its characterization, the book doesn’t just provide a chilling psychological portrait, it conjures up an entire world. The clue is in the name: On some level we’re to imagine that the American Psychiatric Association is a body with real powers, that the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual” is something that might actually be used, and that its caricature of our inner lives could have serious consequences. Sections like those on the personality disorders offer a terrifying glimpse of a futuristic system of repression, one in which deviance isn’t furiously stamped out like it is in Orwell’s unsubtle Oceania, but pathologized instead. Here there’s no need for any rats, and the diagnostician can honestly believe she’s doing the right thing; it’s all in the name of restoring the sick to health. DSM-5 describes a nightmare society in which human beings are individuated, sick, and alone. For much of the novel, what the narrator of this story is describing is its own solitude, its own inability to appreciate other people, and its own overpowering desire for death—but the real horror lies in the world that could produce such a voice.

michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

speaker O.K. Mike? mike Yeah. speaker I want you to start on page 215 — “factual results of the obstruction investigation.”

michael barbaro Today —

speaker Sharon, here’s what I want you to excerpt. I want you to start on page four. Nick, I want you to start at the bottom of page eight.

michael barbaro 448 pages, two years in the making.

speaker That’s new. We didn’t know that.

michael barbaro What we learned from the Mueller report.

speaker 1 That quote is new. speaker 2 It’s a pretty good quote.

michael barbaro It’s Friday, April 19.

michael schmidt Michael, can you hear us?

mark mazzetti Hey, Michael.

michael barbaro Yeah. Hey, guys.

michael schmidt Hey.

mark mazzetti Hey.

michael barbaro All right. Mike Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti, it’s 9:15 on Thursday night. You’ve both now spent about 10 hours reading the Mueller report. Tell me about this thing.

michael schmidt It’s a breathtaking document. It’s over 400 pages of detailed insights and accounts of enormous issues we’ve been focused on over the past two years. It’s divided into, essentially, two halves — one for Russia, one for the president’s actions in office.

michael barbaro In other words, collusion and obstruction. Those are the two buckets.

mark mazzetti Right. The first half detailing the contact between Russians and Trump advisers isn’t enormously revealing, in the sense that we had already heard some weeks ago that there had not been a, quote, “criminal conspiracy” found by Mueller. At the same time, there’s an enormous amount of detail concluding that in the midst of this really historic effort by the Russians to sabotage the election — hacking and leaking of emails, social media manipulation, fake news — it says that the Trump campaign welcomed this. They saw a real benefit of what the Russians were doing, even if at the end of the day there wasn’t an active conspiracy.

michael schmidt He’s essentially saying that they were interested, they sought out information about emails, they wanted to know more about how they could get their hands on these messages. They welcomed all this, but they never crossed the line into breaking the law. Just because they sought out the fruits of the Russian hack doesn’t mean that they were part of the crime.

michael barbaro And just to be very clear, how is what you’re describing, collectively, not collusion?

mark mazzetti Well, I think we need to be careful, because the attorney general said that there was no collusion. And the president said there was no collusion. But the Mueller report is more nuanced. And the Mueller report says, you know, this “collusion” word doesn’t really mean anything to us. There’s no legal standard of collusion. So what we’re going to look at is what is a crime, and that is conspiracy. And that’s what we have to judge all of this voluminous evidence against. And they said that a conspiracy is two parties acting together in concert to break the law. And what Mueller is very clear about is that there is, quote, “insufficient evidence” of a conspiracy. He is not saying there was nothing. He is not saying full exoneration. But he’s saying there is insufficient evidence to meet the standard that he had established of a criminal conspiracy breaking the law.

michael barbaro And what would Mueller have needed to see for this to add up to conspiracy?

michael schmidt That would have looked like a conversation between the Trump campaign and the Russians where the Trump campaign was saying, hey guys, can you go break into the D.N.C. and steal some emails so we can then get them out and embarrass the Democrats and help us politically during the campaign? That would have gotten you down the conspiracy path. And they did not find that.

michael barbaro O.K. So let’s talk about obstruction. Mike, last time we talked, a couple weeks back, Mueller had sent his report to Barr. And Barr had sent a summary of that report to Congress in advance of this full report. And the most confusing thing about that summary was that Mueller had not made a call on whether the evidence added up to obstruction of justice.

michael schmidt And today, we get to see what Mueller’s explanation is for why he didn’t make a determination on whether the president broke the law. And it’s not clear-cut. What it essentially is is that the president, under Justice Department policy, cannot be indicted. And because the president cannot be indicted, it’s unfair to accuse him while he’s in office of breaking the law, because there’s no way for him to go to court to defend himself. So, dear American public, Mueller essentially says, I am not going to make a determination on that issue. That could be made after the president leaves office. But for now, that would be unfair. So what I will do is I will lay out for you what I found, what the potential obstruction was, why it may be illegal. And after the president leaves office, the Justice Department could make a determination that he indeed broke the law and bring a case. And at the end of explaining why a determination was not made, Mueller says, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. So Mueller is basically saying, if we felt comfortable that the president had done nothing wrong, we would tell you. And we are not telling you that.

michael barbaro Well, Mike, you mentioned the incidents that he was not going to use as a basis for charging the president, because he felt he couldn’t charge the president. What were those that he laid out in the report?

michael schmidt Well, there’s about a dozen. And they follow in chronological order how Trump misled the public about his relationship with Russia, misled the public about his knowledge that Russia was behind the hacks. And as the presidency goes on and Mueller is appointed in May of 2017, right after he takes office, the president starts to sort of lose his grip as he tries to maintain control of the investigation. He was intent on using his power as the head of the executive branch to protect himself and use the tools at his disposal — the people running the Justice Department, the F.B.I., the intelligence community — to help protect him from this investigation.

michael barbaro And what are some examples of that — specifics?

michael schmidt Well, a lot of them are ones that we know well. The firing of James Comey. His efforts to get his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation, essentially reassert his control over something that he has stepped aside from because he has a conflict of interest. And when the president can’t get that done, he basically tries to get rid of Sessions and install a loyalist atop the Justice Department. These are things that had been reported in the press. We get a fuller, richer picture of them. And we really see what the president was saying behind closed doors and the immense pressure he was putting on people to try and use the system to protect himself from the system. But then we learn about incidents that we knew little about, like how the president went completely outside of his administration in government to Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager.

michael barbaro Mm-hmm.

michael schmidt And he leaned on Corey in the summer of 2017 to try and pressure Sessions, his attorney general. So here’s the president of the United States using someone who doesn’t even work for him to get to Sessions and try and get Sessions out there publicly to help clear Trump’s name. It’s just a remarkable way of using presidential power.

michael barbaro Which suggests that the president was meeting resistance within his own administration, and therefore reached out to somebody who didn’t even work for the government to try to get him to achieve this end.

michael schmidt I don’t think many in the public will want to hold up the president’s aides as heroes, and a lot of them are probably not. But there is a picture here of folks that stopped the president time and time again and thwarted him from doing things that may have actually gotten him into trouble, that may have crossed that line, that may have made a stronger argument for Mueller about why the president did obstruct justice. One of the most detailed ones is on Trump’s efforts to get rid of Mueller and how his White House counsel would not do that. He would not call the Justice Department on the president’s behalf and say Mueller has to be removed for what the White House counsel, Don McGahn, thought were some bogus reasons Trump had cooked up about why he didn’t like Mueller. And in the document, as Mueller is recounting what happened in this incident, there are Nixonian echoes. It says, on June 17, 2017, the president called McGahn at home and directed him to call the acting attorney general and say that the special counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential “Saturday Night Massacre” — a reference to when Richard Nixon fired the special counsel who was investigating him.

michael barbaro I recognize that this question is a little bit meta, but if getting rid of Mueller had meant that the report was never completed, wouldn’t that have finally been obstruction of justice? Because, literally, an investigation was obstructed.

mark mazzetti There does seem to be a determination here about the success of the president’s efforts, or lack of success — that the fact that the Mueller investigation continued and finished means there is less of a case that the president obstructed justice. If there had been more of a Nixonian moment, where there was an 18-minute gap in tapes that were deliberately erased, that there was some tangible thing that had happened that had meant that prosecutors couldn’t get to the truth, there might possibly have been a different judgment and a different outcome.

michael barbaro Right. I keep thinking of that 18-minute deletion when I think about Don McGahn. It’s as if nobody had ever said to Nixon what Don McGahn had said to President Trump — no, I’m not going to delete that tape. Sorry. But that’s what Don McGahn did to the president. That’s what happened with Trump over and over again.

mark mazzetti Because everyone has seen “All the President’s Men,” and they know what happens. And, you know, you don’t want to be the guy who carries out the “Saturday Night Massacre.”

michael barbaro So the president really has these people around him to thank, in a lot of ways.

michael schmidt At the end of the day, there were these folks that were not going to go that extra inch and go over the line for him. And it looks like those measures probably saved him.

mark mazzetti I mean, Mueller lays this point out explicitly. This is a quote from the report. “The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful. But that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or cede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the F.B.I. McGahn did not tell the acting attorney general that the special counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the president’s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the president’s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russian investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the president’s direction to have the special counsel removed, despite the president’s multiple demands to do so.”

michael barbaro Hmm. And Mike, before seeing this report, our understanding of why Mueller may not have reached a conclusion on obstruction of justice was that obstruction has a lot to do with intent. Why did the president take the actions that he took? What did we learn from the report about how Mueller might have been thinking about that?

michael schmidt We learn that the president was intent on ending the investigation into himself, but it’s less clear about what was truly motivating him.

michael barbaro I guess I don’t quite understand that. If his intent is to end the investigation, how is that not obstruction of justice?

mark mazzetti This is the heart of this dispute right now.

michael schmidt Yeah.

mark mazzetti It’s a clash of two theories. I mean, Mueller’s team clearly indicated that the actions come up to the line of obstruction of justice — that the intent to end the investigation to preserve his presidency does, in fact, approach something that is criminal obstruction of justice, even if they did not make that determination. The rub here is that it is at odds with the theory of Robert Mueller’s boss, Attorney General Barr. He got the job of attorney general, some say, based on his theory that the president can’t really obstruct justice. Barr says, today, in his press conference —

archived recording (william barr) President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office.

mark mazzetti At the heart of a obstruction of justice investigation is whether that person has corrupt intent. And his determination is that the president didn’t. And in a way, this big debate over the intent of the president — Barr kind of goes out of his way today to fill in the blanks, to sort of say, well, let’s look at the president’s intent.

archived recording (william barr) At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion.

mark mazzetti The president felt that this was consuming his presidency.

archived recording (william barr) There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation.

mark mazzetti Yeah. He wanted this thing over. So in a way, what was one of the things that was so extraordinary about Barr’s press conference was that he explains the president’s reasoning in a way that the president hasn’t himself.

michael barbaro So Barr would say that trying to end the investigation to protect the presidency is not corrupt motive. In fact, in his telling, it’s arguably even important, maybe even a little bit noble. It’s in the best interest of the American people.

michael schmidt Perhaps patriotic.

michael barbaro Hmm.

mark mazzetti So there’s this totally compelling moment in the middle of the report that paints a scene of the president being told that a special counsel had just been appointed. And I’ll quote directly from the report. “The president slumped back in his chair and said, ‘Oh, my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.’ The president became angry and lambasted the attorney general for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, ‘How could you let this happen, Jeff?’ The president said the position of attorney general was his most important appointment, and that Sessions had, quote, ‘let him down,’ contrasting him with Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the president said to him, ‘You were supposed to protect me,’ or words to that effect. The president returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, ‘Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years, and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.’” The way this passage reads is the president’s anger about the appointment of a special counsel comes mostly from the recognition that it’s going to imperil his presidency. It means nothing will get done. It means that he’s going to spend the rest of his term fighting it. It’s not because he’s worried that Robert Mueller might find something that will one day land Donald Trump in jail. That’s one reading of this passage that would bolster the argument made by the attorney general that the president faced this extraordinary situation.

michael schmidt I don’t think that makes any sense. Or at least I don’t understand it. I don’t understand how the attorney general can say there’s no issue of an underlying crime here when Donald Trump is sitting there acknowledging the potential threat from the depth and breadth of a special counsel’s investigation. He knew at that point, in May of 2017, that he had had his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, make hush money payments to women. Donald Trump was smart enough to know that a special counsel — like in Bill Clinton or any other presidency — rummages around on one issue and ends up on another. And what happens? Mueller finds these weird transactions. He refers it to another U.S. attorney’s office. And the president is ultimately in a completely separate investigation, named as an unindicted co-conspirator.

michael barbaro Hmm.

michael schmidt How is there not an underlying crime that Donald Trump was afraid about? In July of 2017, myself and two colleagues go into the Oval Office to interview the president. He says, if Mueller looks at my finances, it’s crossing a red line. So what were Trump’s motivations for getting rid of Mueller? Was he really worried about Russia? Or was he worried that, hey, if this guy rummages around on Russia, he’s going to find something else? Indeed, he did.

michael barbaro So Mike, you’re saying that Barr’s argument — that the president is just protecting the presidency — doesn’t really hold up. Because we know for a fact that the president understood, at this point, that when he says, I’m effed, that he has these payments made in coordination with Michael Cohen to these women as hush money, which have nothing to do with the Russia investigation, but which obviously could be incredibly damaging to him, and maybe even criminal.

michael schmidt Look, no one has questioned the president about this in a law enforcement setting. I don’t know exactly what the president’s intentions were, but the idea that there was no underlying criminality in Donald Trump’s life in May of 2017, when Mueller got appointed, is bogus. Because there was. Further, in December of 2017, there is a report out there that Mueller has subpoenaed the president’s bank records.

michael barbaro Mm-hmm.

michael schmidt Before the president’s lawyers are able to get the message to him that the report is wrong, he starts telling White House aides that Mueller has to go.

michael barbaro Hmm.

michael schmidt I do think there’s a decent case to be made that there were underlying issues of criminality within his life. The Justice Department has said that itself.

michael barbaro O.K. So regardless of the president’s intent, is it important whether or not he was successful in impeding this investigation, in thinking about the question of obstruction of justice?

michael schmidt Well, I think for the folks at the Justice Department who had to make the call about whether the president broke the law, one of the factors that played into their declination decision was the fact that when you looked at the investigation, the efforts that the president took did not significantly damage the inquiry.

michael barbaro Right.

michael schmidt Despite the president’s best efforts, he was not very good at obstructing justice.

michael barbaro Right. The existence of the Mueller report today suggests that the investigation did not get obstructed.

michael schmidt Despite all of Donald Trump’s huffing and puffing and trying to get this person to do this and this person to do that, Bob Mueller moved ahead unimpeded for two years, finished his investigation, and the entire country got to see the fruits of it. Show us where the obstruction is, is what the president’s defenders would say.

[music]

michael barbaro We’ll be right back. So finally, I want to talk about Bill Barr’s role in all this. Because the position of many Democrats today was that Barr — in reaching a decision on obstruction of justice where Mueller did not, in holding a press conference ahead of the report’s release seeming to defend the president, all taken together — has undermined any credibility that he had, and that Democrats and the country need to see for themselves what Mueller had found. How are you thinking about Barr in this moment, having now spent time with the Mueller report?

mark mazzetti I mean, the one thing is clear is that this has been a lot of red meat for Democrats in Congress to keep investigating. And one of the things that they’re going to keep investigating is Barr’s role in this entire process. They are going to try to get him up to testify. They are going to try to get more underlying documents in the Mueller investigation. They now see Barr as a clear target for them. I think a lot of people, because of all these actions, have a much different picture of the attorney general than they did a month or two ago.

michael barbaro And they’re going to try to understand the differences between what Bob Mueller thinks about all this — the supposedly nonpartisan figure — and what Bill Barr thinks about this — the presidential appointee whose allegiances are clearly closer to the president.

michael schmidt There’s one answer to this. And that is that after this entire investigation in which Bob Mueller has said nothing publicly, including today, when there was a press conference held to talk about his report, we need to hear from Bob Mueller. We need for him to explain to us more how they came to this determination that they couldn’t say whether the president violated the law or not. Does Mueller think that Barr has misrepresented some of his findings? What was his relationship with the Justice Department? Did he believe that Congress should deal with this issue and that Barr shouldn’t have made a call on whether the president violated the law? We need to hear from Mueller. We have never heard his voice in the past two years.

michael barbaro So inadvertently, in seeming to protect the president and not be representing Mueller, Bill Barr may be extending Democrats’ interest in this investigation and the trouble for the president.

mark mazzetti Absolutely. If you look back at what Barr has done in the last month, this could have turned out differently for him — if he had put out the report immediately after the letter or as soon after the letter as he could have, if he had characterized the report differently in that four-page letter, and if he hadn’t had a press conference on the day of the release before anyone had seen the report that had this appearance of trying to spin it for the president and protect the president. That seems to have created more problems both for Barr and the president than if they had just released the report.

michael barbaro Mark, thank you very much. Mike, thank you very much.

mark mazzetti Thank you.

michael schmidt Thanks for having us.

However much of a full-spectrum conservative she may have been in the past, it’s been clear for awhile that she’s now a single-issue voter:

I don't care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in White House after this immigration policy paper. http://t.co/l7nq8gN7i5 — Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) August 16, 2015

Here she is with Margaret Hoover affirming that fact in the starkest way:

Ann Coulter feeling the Bern? The conservative commentator says Sanders has supported immigration policies that could earn him her vote, adding she’d be willing to overlook “the rest of the socialist stuff.” pic.twitter.com/8vH4LAWmVP — Firing Line with Margaret Hoover (@FiringLineShow) April 17, 2019

She’s not joking, but one way to dismiss the seriousness of her point is to shrug and say that Bernie’s not going back to his “strong borders” views of 10 years ago under any circumstances and Coulter knows it. She’s specifically offering a what-if which she and everyone else understands won’t come to pass, on the order of “I’ll vote for Obama once he becomes a Republican.” Even Bernie doesn’t have enough progressive goodwill stockpiled to survive a Democratic primary in 2019 if he shifted towards border hawkishness. This is a party, after all, that treats racial and ethnic identity as no less important than class identity. Sanders arguing that we need to keep poor Latinos out to protect the wages of poor Americans just won’t hack it. If nothing else, it reeks of nationalism — and since when do ambitious socialists draw the limits of the cause at national borders?

Here’s the thing about Bernie, though, which may keep Coulter interested in him for the next year or so: He’s clearly uncomfortable with the extent of the left’s craving for open borders. He’s willing to bow to them by adopting a more permissive attitude towards illegal immigration but he makes noise regularly to signal his misgivings. Ten days ago he warned lefties that fully open borders would attract poor people to the U.S. from all over the world, which is sort of the point to advocates of the idea. Bernie won’t go there, though. We can only take so many, he insisted, a terrifying reminder that the country’s most prominent supporter of Medicare for All is more serious about the limits of national resources than his own base is. He signaled his skepticism of open borders again at that Fox News town hall a few nights ago:

“We have a problem at the border, a serious problem … We need the proper legal processes at the border so that these issues can be adjudicated to determine whether or not people or should be entitled to asylum,” Sanders said April 15. When asked where the migrants could be kept prior to their asylum hearings, Sanders responded by saying, “What about building proper facilities for them right now? That can be done right on the border.”… The government needs more immigration judges to quickly process asylum claims by migrants, Sanders said. “You’re coming into the country? Are you really fleeing violence or is it another reason?’ You need to have many, many more judges to expedite the process,” Sanders stated.

The Ocasio-Cortez left doesn’t want people turned away just because their claims of persecution back home are bogus. They want them admitted essentially as a matter of right, because they’re seeking a better life. Bernie’s sterner answer at the town hall was noticed by border hawk Mickey Kaus, who tweeted about it approvingly and was then retweeted by Coulter, further evidence that she’s intrigued by his maneuvers on immigration. It would be some ideological journey for her to go from stalwart Mitt Romney fan to Chris Christie enthusiast to “In Trump We Trust” author to ridealong on Bernie Sanders’s socialist revolution in the span of less than a decade.

Tell me this. Among the various arguments made by righties against illegal immigration — cultural, economic, political — one that turns up in almost every critique of comprehensive immigration reform is electoral, namely, the fear that millions of illegals will vote Democratic once they’re granted citizenship. “They come from statist systems. Give them a ballot in the U.S. and they’ll opt for statism here too, especially with Democrats promising them the sun, moon, and stars in benefits to win their votes. We’ll end up with socialism.” Now here’s Coulter claiming that the alleged nightmare scenario, socialism, is actually … just fine as a trade-off so long as it means keeping low-skilled Mexicans out. What’s left of the electoral argument against amnesty?
Hillary Clinton speaks during the 10th Anniversary Women In The World Summit in New York on April 12. (Mike Coppola/Getty Images)

President Trump pushed for obtaining Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s private emails, and his campaign was in touch with allies who were pursuing them, according to the redacted special counsel’s report released Thursday.

On July 27, 2016, Trump famously said at a campaign rally, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” referring to emails that Clinton said she had deleted from her private server. She had used a private account during her tenure as secretary of state.

Trump also “made this request repeatedly” during the campaign, former national security adviser Michael Flynn told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. Flynn “contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails,” including Peter Smith, a longtime Republican operative, and Barbara Ledeen, a Republican Senate staffer who herself had previously tried to find the emails. Ledeen, at the time, worked for Sen. Charles E. Grassley on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Months earlier, Ledeen had written to Smith that Clinton’s server had likely been breached long ago and that “the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services could ‘reassemble the server’s email content.’”

After Trump’s July comments about Russia, Smith launched his own effort to find the missing emails.

“He created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates,” the investigation found. Smith also claimed “he was in contact with hackers ‘with ties and affiliations to Russia’ who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump campaign,” but the special counsel could not establish if that was true.

In August, Smith wrote to Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis, among others, about his efforts. “Parties with varying interests, are circling to release [the emails] ahead of the election,” Smith said. And as Smith raised thousands of dollars for his efforts, he told potential donors he was doing his work “in coordination” with the Trump campaign, the special counsel found. The investigation only found that Smith communicated directly with Flynn and Clovis.

Ledeen later told Smith she believed she had obtained a trove of emails that might be Clinton’s. Smith wanted to authenticate them, and Erik Prince, the private military contractor, Trump supporter and brother of current Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, “provided funding to hire a tech adviser to ascertain the authenticity of the emails.”

According to Prince, the tech adviser determined that the emails were not authentic, the report found. Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that Smith, Ledeen, or others in touch with the Trump campaign obtained the Clinton emails.

The special counsel also did not find evidence that any Trump campaign staff or associates “initiated or directed Smith’s efforts.”

A mechanic who came to Canada in 2015 has been found complicit in crimes against humanity for repairing vehicles for the so-called Islamic State, Global News has learned.

Before arriving in Canada and claiming refugee status, the Lebanese national made several trips to Syria to work on ISIS military vehicles and also supervised other ISIS mechanics.

As such, he made a “knowing and significant contribution to ISIS,” the Refugee Appeal Division ruled, noting the terror group needed his high-level expertise in auto electrical systems.

Vehicles in good working order were “vital to the success of ISIS,” and were used for suicide bombings and combat, the panel wrote in a 23-page decision handed down in Montreal.

The ruling means he is ineligible for refugee status, but federal officials would not say if he was detained or had been deported. Even his name was removed from the decision.

His lawyer declined to comment.

The case is a rare confirmation that a refugee claimant who successfully entered Canada had been involved with ISIS, although his past was quickly detected through security screening.

The Canadian embassy in Beirut approved his visa on May 5, 2015 after his wife’s sister, who lives in Canada, sent a letter of invitation. He made a refugee claim in September 2015.

Three months later, federal officials intervened in his case, arguing he was disqualified from seeking refugee status because he was complicit in the crimes of ISIS.

The Immigration and Refugee Board agreed, and the decision was recently upheld by Patricia O’Connor of the Refugee Appeal Division, who rejected his claim that he had only worked for ISIS briefly and under duress.

According to the decision, the man was employed as a mechanic in Zahlé, a Lebanese city close to the Syrian border, when a customer asked him to repair vehicles at a location 30 to 40 minutes away.

He was eventually taken during the night to a hangar in a Sunni area where he was patted down for weapons. A Christian, he was forced to remove his cross and his cell phone was taken away.

Inside the hangar were 15 to 20 vehicles of the type ISIS used. When he touched one vehicle, it was still wet with blood.

Foreigners with long beards who spoke with Syrian or Iraqi accents were installing metal armor on jeeps and trucks that had no licence plates.

The vehicles had been repainted and fitted with metal bars to reinforce them “for military conflict,” according to the decision, which said he knew on his first visit that he was involved with ISIS.

Armed men escorted him repeatedly to the hangar to work on vehicles, and on three occasions he was taken across the border to Syria to do repairs. He was close enough to the fighting to see shelling.

“While ISIS had its own mechanics, he was needed to fix vehicles with problematic issues that no one else could repair,” the decision read. “He also supervised other mechanics and gave instruction on how to repair the vehicles which were used for military purposes.”

He was paid “a lot of cash,” the IRB said. “He said that they treated him well, paid him generously and trusted him to the extent that he was brought to ISIS locations in Lebanon and Syria.”

At one point, a Chinese visa was placed in his passport and he was told he was being sent to China to acquire materials, since ISIS thought “no one would suspect that a Christian would import things on their behalf.”

But the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah found out what he was doing and approached him at work, offering $1,000 a night to spy on ISIS. He said Hezbollah also threatened him.

He ended his involvement with ISIS in May 2015 and came to Canada. While he said he had no other option but to work for ISIS, the IRB rejected that.

“He returned voluntarily over and over again to work on ISIS vehicles because he did not flee or attempt to flee ISIS,” the Refugee Board wrote in its decision.

“Instead of fleeing, he returned at least four to six more times to work for ISIS before he left the country. He returned to work for ISIS even when he touched blood in the vehicle and knew it was ISIS.”

The Canada Border Services Agency is also trying to deport a Jordanian who came to British Columbia and obtained refugee status, but in 2015 began posting ISIS propaganda online.

When photographer William Miller stumbled on a vintage Polaroid SX-70 camera for just $18 at a garage sale in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he snatched it up. Once home, he loaded it with film and started snapping pictures. The photos it spat out were a mess—abstract glops of color that could hardly be called photographs.

Miller put the camera away and promptly forgot about it. When the Impossible Projectstarted making instant film for Polaroids, he dug out his camera and tried again. This time, he embraced the blurry images. "I was like, 'There might be something to this,'" he says.

There was, and it resulted in the series Ruined Polaroids.

Letting the camera do its thing, Miller pointed it wherever he liked and waited to see what the machine shot back. "It didn’t really make a difference," he says. "If I pointed it at Kennedy being shot it would still look like grass on the moon."

To process an exposed photo, a Polaroid forces the film through two rollers that burst pouches of chemicals within the white space at the bottom of the film. The the rollers smear those chemicals over the film, developing the image. Miller guesses the rollers in his camera don't work properly, resulting in all those weird blobs and lines.

At some point he tried to repair restore the SX-70, which is a favorite among collectors and can sometimes sell for several hundred bucks. He sprayed WD-40 inside the camera and even tracked down the schematics so he could take bits of the camera apart. Nothing he did helped, and might have made it worse. "I definitely used to wrestle with that thing,” he says. “It was kind of an abusive relationship.”

Over time Miller developed a deep appreciation for the bizarre snapshots, and started using it as cathartic relief. Working as a photojournalist for the *New York Post, *Miller must be careful about how he depicts the people and places he shoots. With the Polaroid, the photos showed "nothing," so he was free to simply depress the shutter. “These ruined Polaroid’s aren’t of anything, and there are so few pictures where that’s the case,” he says.

The project ended when the camera mysteriously started working again on its own. It doesn't take great pictures, but the abstractions are gone, and so is the experiment. “When it started working, that just made the whole thing more endearing,” he says. “So much about all this is just chance.”
Special counsel Robert Mueller described a previously unknown example of the President’s attempts to curtail the investigation involving Trump’s former campaign aide Cory Lewandowski.

Mueller says that on June 19, 2017, Trump met in the Oval Office with Lewandowski and dictated a message intended for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who at that point had recused himself from matters involving the probe.

In the message, Sessions was told to publicly announce the investigation was “‘very unfair’ to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the special counsel and ‘let [him] move forward with investigation election meddling for future elections.’” Lewandowski told Trump he understood his instructions.

A month later, Trump checked back in with Lewandowski on the status of his message. Lewandowski said the message would be delivered soon.

Ultimately, Lewandowski declined to deliver the message personally, instead asking a senior White House official — Rick Dearborn — to do it instead. Mueller’s report says Dearborn was “uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.”

Nusrat Jahan Rafi was doused with kerosene and set on fire at her school in Bangladesh. Less than two weeks earlier, she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against her headmaster.

Her courage in speaking out against sexual assault, her death five days after being set alight and everything that happened in-between has gripped Bangladesh and brought attention to the vulnerability of sexual harassment victims in this conservative South Asian country.

Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out.

Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened.

At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal.

In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint "no big deal" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media.

'I tried to take her to school'

Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these.

On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety.

Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams.

"I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter," said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman.

"If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister," he said.

According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire.

Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted "to make it look like a suicide". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died.

"One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned," Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali.

But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone.

"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath," you can hear her say.

She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa.

News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni.

Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. "None of the culprits will be spared from legal action," she said.

Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh.

"Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists," said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page.

"I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry," wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post.

According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher.

"When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations," said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association.

"It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples."

Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh?

In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students.

"This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done," said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka.

"Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools," she said.

"They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment."

We can learn much about psychology by paying attention to what people do in the world and then exploring it under more controlled conditions. One way that can be done quite effectively, it turns out, is by using the work of magicians.

At the risk of spoiling the fun, magicians don’t actually make things disappear or make one card change into another. Instead, they engage in actions that misdirect people’s attention in ways that prevent them from seeing how the magician has created the illusion of change.

One thing that seems to lead people to miss changes is a switch in direction. A magician might wave a card in the air in front of an audience and, when switching direction from left to right or vertical to horizontal, also make a change in the of the card. Suddenly, it seems that one card has become another.

Is the switch in direction really the important element here, or is it just that magicians perform their actions so quickly that people don’t see them?

This question was addressed in a set of studies by Richard Yao, Katherine Wood, and Dan Simons reported in the March 2019 issue of the journal Psychological Science.

They had people look at a computer screen and try to detect a change in the orientation of something called a Gabor patch. A Gabor patch is essentially circle containing black and white bars that point in a particular direction. For example, they might point at an angle that is roughly 2 o'clock to 8 o’clock.

To make the task a bit more difficult, there were six of these patches on the screen at the same time. At some point, one of these patches shifted from one orientation (say 2-to-8 o’clock) to another (perhaps 4-to-10 o’clock). The participants' was to say which patch moved after the trial was over.

Here’s where the motion comes in.

The collection of patches shifted between moving horizontally across the screen and moving vertically. The change in the orientation of one of the patches happened either while the collection was moving horizontally or at the moment when the movement shifted from horizontal to vertical.

Participants correctly detected the change in orientation of the patch about 86% of the time when it happened while the patches were moving horizontally. When the change happened at the moment of the switch in direction, they detected the change only about 26% of the time. The researchers repeated this study a few times with some variations and always found that changes in orientation were harder for people to see at the moment of a shift in direction that while the patch was moving in a straight line. In one variation, they used eye tracking to make sure that people stayed fixated on the screen during the change in direction.

What makes this result impressive is that people are failing to notice a shift even though they are looking in the direction of what is changing. People’s attention to detail is drawn away by the change in direction of movement.

One way to think about this is that in the real world, the identity of objects generally does not change suddenly. So, the human visual system is not set up to make sure that the object you’re looking at remains the same one the entire time you’re looking at it. Instead, the visual system detects important shifts in —and a change in the direction of motion of something in the world is an important shift. Magicians exploit this aspect of visual attention to create illusions.

Luckily, even when you know this about attention, illusions still work. Understanding attention a bit better need not ruin your enjoyment of a good magic show.
It can take years for declining plant and animal species to make it on to Canada’s Species At Risk registry — where they often languish for several more as governments weigh political considerations and commercial interests against the brute reality of extinction

Fish scientist Eric Taylor wanted to make a difference.

He was more than happy to toil behind the scenes if it helped to save a slew of at-risk Canadian species, be they the iconic Pacific sockeye salmon or the obscure Acadian redfish.

After chairing the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) for the past four years, however, Taylor departs a frustrated, anxious man.

While the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) has done some good since it took effect in 2002, including increased monitoring, assessments and public awareness, the legislation remains too cumbersome, is riddled with political loopholes and is failing Canada’s most vulnerable species, such as salmon and steelhead populations in B.C.

“A long, winding and never-ending road,” is how Taylor, professor of zoology and director of the Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia, describes the federal process of formally listing a species.

“It just takes too damn long.”

Action plans with no action

COSEWIC is an independent body of scientists established to impartially assess the status of at-risk plants and animals and make recommendations to the federal government for SARA listings, including endangered, threatened or special concern.

Take a deep breath — the listing process is a cumbersome one.

First, COSEWIC makes a recommendation, then government provides a response statement, followed by a round of public consultation, a recovery-potential assessment, a regulatory impact statement analysis, more public consultation and, ultimately, a ministerial recommendation to cabinet — which then has nine months to list the species, to not list or refer back to COSEWIC for further consideration.

“There are several steps in the process, and all it takes is one of those steps … to hold everything else up,” Taylor laments.

Once the government finally decides to list a species as endangered, the process of developing a recovery strategy begins, including more public consultation and, finally, an action plan. Of the latter, Taylor snorts: “It’s a stupid term. It’s a plan to do something. Why not just frickin’ do it?”

When all is said and done, he adds: “There’s nothing in there, nothing mandated, that actually says you have to do anything to help the animals and plants on the ground.”

“They have to report on what they’ve done, and that report could say, ‘we haven’t done anything, yet,’ ” Taylor says.

Critical habitat ‘can be destroyed with impunity’

Indeed, lack of protection for critical habitat is another key weak point in the legislation.

Mike Pearson, an independent biologist and expert in endangered freshwater fishes and amphibians in the Fraser Valley, notes that the vast majority of species listed under the Species at Risk Act are threatened primarily by habitat loss.

The act protects the residence of an endangered species — say, a nest or den — and protects against the animal being killed or harassed.

At least, that’s the theory.

The Oregon spotted frog is the rarest amphibian in Canada and listed as endangered; critical habitat has been mapped and the recovery strategy completed.

Yet Pearson watched helplessly the other day as an Agassiz farmer torched a riparian area within the frog’s known breeding site — and in the middle of breeding season, no less.

Since biologists are not permitted to survey for the frogs on the farmer’s private land “there is no way to prove that the frogs/eggs were present at the time” of the fire, Pearson says.

“Essentially, a lot of endangered species’ critical habitat in B.C. can be destroyed with impunity.”

Few convictions for breaking species at risk laws

There’s been fewer than one conviction per year on average under the Species at Risk Act.

In October 2018, a World Wildlife Fund report concluded that at-risk populations continued to decline by an average of 28 per cent since the act took effect in 2002.

In some cases, the federal government moves only after being hauled to court.

Ecojustice, a charity that advances environmental litigation, has achieved a handful of successes, forcing the federal government to act on critical habitat of endangered species, including the greater sage-grouse on the Prairies and both the Nooksack dace and southern resident killer whale in B.C.

Ecojustice lawyer Sean Nixon says one of the big problems is that provinces — not the federal government — own most of the land, yet Ottawa is reluctant to force provinces to protect habitat. “It’s jurisdictional timidity, just not willing to step on a province’s toes.”

Marine fishes less likely to be listed

In 1996, the provinces and the territories and the federal government signed an accord on bringing in legislation to protect endangered species. But 21 years later, Alberta, B.C., Saskatchewan and the Yukon still have no stand-alone legislation (PDF) on endangered species.

In February 2018, a University of Ottawa study concluded that the Species at Risk Act’s failings included inadequate funding, insufficient incentives for stewardship among private landowners and industry, patchy efforts to protect the act on provincial and territorial crown land and private land and a lack of information on effectiveness of recovery actions.

The process of listing has been especially problematic for marine fishes. It’s no exaggeration to say you could fill an aquarium with all the species recommended for listing by COSEWIC that are still awaiting federal protection under the Species at Risk Act.

Ottawa is reluctant to list a species if doing so may have serious economic and social implications.

And when it does act, Taylor says, government tends to choose the least protective option, listing these species as of “special concern” — a category that avoids no-take, no-harm directives.

“It is a well-known fact that things hunted and fished tend not to get listed by the minister.”

As of 2018, he noted, almost 100 per cent of birds recommended by COSEWIC had been listed compared with fewer than 40 per cent for marine fishes — the lowest of 10 categories ranging from birds and mammals to molluscs and mosses.

“If you’re a bird and you get a recommendation for listing by COSEWIC, it’s almost always a slam dunk,” Taylor says.

“If you’re a marine fish, chances are you will not get listed.”

Government action not guaranteed for listed species

Typically, it takes two years for COSEWIC to reach a recommendation, but emergency assessments can be made much faster when there is an imminent and dire threat.

Even in those cases, there is no guarantee of government action.

In January 2018, COSEWIC recommended emergency listing for endangered Chilcotin River and Thompson River steelhead runs after the number of returning adults dipped to just 58 and 177 individuals, respectively.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has still not acted.

“They could do it in 24 hours if they wanted to,” Taylor says. “If the political will is there, they can do these things. SARA for salmon and steelhead? It’s a major disappointment. It’s done very little for those animals.”

COSEWIC strictly looks at the species’ conservation status, while Canada must consider the greater implications of a listing.

“Protecting species under the Species at Risk Act, even on an emergency basis, is a regulatory decision with potential impacts on Canadians,” federal fisheries spokeswoman Janine Malikian said in a written statement. “We want to ensure that decisions support sustainability and the best results for Canadians.”

“SARA for salmon and steelhead? It’s a major disappointment. It’s done very little for those animals.”

While a decision has yet to be made on Thompson and Chilcotin steelhead, Malikian said: “Conservation of these steelhead populations remains an extremely high priority and will be a focus of decisions with respect to fisheries management plans for the year ahead.”

Canada, Taylor argues, wrongly believes it can have it all.

“They don’t want to protect them because they have this crazy notion that you can somehow grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. In most cases, they’re two opposites. You can’t have both at the same time.”

Endangered stocks can migrate upstream with larger healthier mixed-stock runs and become caught in fisheries, including First Nation gillnets in the Fraser River.

“I don’t really care who you are,” Taylor says. “No group has the right to fish something to extinction. Fisheries can be a very important part of reconciliation, but these fish shouldn’t be sacrificed to reconciliation and I don’t think any First Nation would want that.”

More public engagement, stricter timelines needed

Taylor asserts that the federal decision to list a species is influenced by business, jobs and votes. Climate-change related events, such as destructive floods and fires, may help to change public minds and pressure their government to act more quickly, including for marine fishes, he adds.

COSEWIC designated the Cultus Lake sockeye endangered in an emergency listing in 2002. The federal government decided against listing the population, citing “significant socio-economic impacts on sockeye fishers and coastal communities.”

Taylor said the public needs to be more engaged.

“You need millions of people to care about these animals and plants and most people just don’t. It’s sad but it’s true.”

Little has changed on the ground since the Liberals took power in 2015, Taylor argues.

“The bottom line, I’d say that the state of our biodiversity in Canada hasn’t changed much since they’ve come in,” he says, noting it will take more than a single four-year term of office to reverse a “legacy of inaction.”

“You need millions of people to care about these animals and plants and most people just don’t. It’s sad but it’s true.”

The federal government announced several measures Tuesday to help protect depressed chinook stocks on the Fraser River, which prevents sport anglers in southern B.C. from taking chinook until July 14, followed by a daily limit of one per person through December 31. Season limits drop to 10 chinook from 30.

Commercial troll fisheries for chinook are closed until August 20, while First Nations’ food, social and ceremonial fishing is closed until July 15.

In 2017, Richard Cannings, a prominent naturalist and NDP MP for South Okanagan-West Kootenay, introduced a private member’s bill to amend the Species at Risk Act to impose stricter timelines on the government.

The bill would have required that after receiving a COSEWIC recommendation, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change would have one year to recommend to cabinet that the assessment be accepted and the species added to the list, the species not be added or the matter be referred back to COSEWIC for further consideration.

Cabinet would have one month to act or the minister would by order list the species, or provide reasons why not or what action is planned.

Under the current situation the clock only starts ticking on action once the minister informs cabinet of a COSEWIC recommendation — a loophole the former Conservative government of Stephen Harper exploited to ignore COSEWIC.

“It was a very reasonable bill,” Cannings told The Narwhal. “The whole point is to make it a timely, open and transparent process.”

Cannings withdrew the bill after Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna agreed that as a matter of government policy a decision on listing a species would be made within two years — or three years for commercial/hunted species.

“To give them the benefit of the doubt, they’re facing a very big backlog of species that have been ignored during the Conservative years,” Cannings allows.

Taylor’s solution is “very firm time limits” on when the minister must make a decision on recommendations for endangered species listing.

The feds should automatically accept COSEWIC recommendations for listing to avoid the “active harming or killing” of species at risk. Then “take all the time they want” to consider the social and economic consequence of maintaining or tweaking the listing.

“They should automatically go on the list, right away.”

Simply pouring more money into the problem is not the answer, he says.

Federal fisheries Minister Jonathan Wilkinson and B.C. Premier John Horgan announced last month that the two governments will provide a total of $142.8 million toward a five-year program to protect and enhance wild salmon.

“Come on people,” says Taylor, noting the time for concrete action is long overdue.

“They love to throw money at things … but it won’t do any good.”

Plastic pollution in the oceans is a huge, disgusting problem. Which is why it’s pretty fitting that Greenpeace decided to raise awareness of one company’s contributions with huge, disgusting trash monsters.



On Tuesday, Greenpeace activists hauled a 15-foot-tall heap of garbage, artfully crafted to resemble one of those deep sea fish that’s about 90 percent jowl, out in front of the Nestlé’s U.S. headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. An even bigger trash monster was delivered earlier in the day to the company’s global headquarters in Switzerland, while similar leviathans cropped up in Italy, Kenya, and the Philippines, Greenpeace oceans campaigner Kate Melges told Earther in a phone interview.

It was all part of a global day of action to raise awareness of Nestlé’s contributions to the estimated 8 million tons of plastic entering our oceans each year. And sea monsters made of spent shopping bags and disposable cutlery aren’t the worst metaphor for the future we’re headed toward, one in which the oceans may contain more plastic than fish.

“Really, we just wanted to visualize the monster that has been created with single use plastic packaging and get Nestlé to own up and take some responsibility,” Melges said.

In recent months, Nestlé has come under fire what advocates say is an outsized contribution to the plastic crisis. An 2018 audit conducted by a constellation of groups under the banner Break Free From Plastic found Nestlé products to be the third the most often-recovered pieces of ocean trash. Facing mounting pressure, the company has taken some positive steps, including saying it’ll phase out “non recyclable or hard to recycle” plastics by 2025, beginning with plastic straws this year, and introduce more reusable packaging.

But many environmentalists consider recycling-focused pledges to be wholly inadequate. After all, recycling still takes energy, contributing to climate-warming carbon emissions. And plastics recycling, specifically, has been a mess ever since China, a major player, stopped accepting imports of post-consumer plastic last year. Recyclers all over the U.S. and the world increasingly have been forced to divert plastic to landfills or incinerators, a problem that is only expected to grow.

“We know that just because something is recyclable doesn’t mean it’ll get recycled,” Melges said. “They [Nestlé] need to move away from recycling being a huge part of the solution ... and go back to reusable packaging.”

In a statement provided to Earther, Nestlé touted its efforts to do exactly that, including a recent partnership with Loop that allows customers to get their Häagen-Dazs fix guilt-free (or guilt-reduced) by purchasing it in a “reusable double-walled steel ice cream container.”

“We are determined to reduce our use of single-use plastics,” a Nestlé spokesperson told Earther. “We are introducing reusable packaging, new delivery systems and innovative business models”

Clearly, Nestlé is hearing activists on this issue and making some moves accordingly. Perhaps having the trash version of Jabba the Hutt parked outside its offices for a day—“repeatedly spew[ing] Nestlé plastic pollution gathered from across the country,” according to a press release—will encourage the company to step things up further.
In other words, if the original charge proves to be baseless, the complainants will invariably lower the threshold of guilt so that even a lesser transgression will be sufficient to condemn the accused.

The ridiculously long, drawn out, overdone "Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election" investigation proves an ages-old political maxim: the benchmark of proof that a political accusation has to satisfy in order to be considered true will constantly change as the needs of the accuser shift in response to new information.

President Trump is the latest example of that. Let's be candid here — everything about President Trump is anathema to the Democrats.

He beat Hillary Clinton, depriving the Democrats of boasting how they elected the country's first female president.

He is direct, unequivocal, and absolute in his policy pronouncements, eschewing the usual "nod-nod, wink-wink" of Washington speak. What makes it even worse is that President Trump's policy pronouncements are conservative, and his direct, clear-meaning speech rips the cover off years of oh, so carefully developed liberal deceptions.

President Trump calls out the Democrat-sympathetic liberal media for who they are, enraging his enemies for not rolling over and meekly accepting mistreatment at the hands of his liberal opponents the way his milquetoast Republican predecessors did.

His policies — the withdrawal from the Paris Accords, his dismissal of the Iranian nuclear agreements, his tough stance regarding NATO paying its fair share, his position on border security and illegal immigration, his desire for greater domestic American energy production, the re-negotiation of international trade agreements to be more advantageous to this country, and many others — are so blatantly pro-American and popular with the average voter that the supposedly sophisticated liberal Democratic intelligentsia are infuriated over the way his approach resonates in such a positive, commonsense manner with so many people.

Therefore, with Democrats unable to accept Trump's 2016 victory (no surprise, really, in light of how they and the liberal media refused to accept George W. Bush's election victory over Gore in 2000 or Bush's defeat of John Kerry in 2004, blaming that on Ohio voting irregularities and unscrupulous, deceptive "Swiftboating" attacks), the Democratic Party desperately searched for a reason to explain Hillary's defeat, a reason they could take to the general public and convince them that Trump's election win was illegitimate. At the best, the Democrats hoped to somehow delegitimize his victory, and have it voided (by some vague, never explained, nonexistent legal mechanism); at the very least, they hoped to sully him so badly that they'd force a disgraced resignation or completely torpedo any possibility of his re-election in 2020.

Hence, the Mueller investigation was born. It's not necessary to recount here the questionable basis on which the investigation was founded, the highly partisan make-up of the roster of "impartial" investigators, or the blatantly improper legal procedures that were swept under the rug by both the Mueller panel and the liberal media (such as the erroneously granted, baseless FISA warrants). These are all well known and have been documented before in great detail.

But what is fascinating is that now that the Mueller report has come to the conclusion that there is no justification for any further indictments of anyone (including President Trump) for reasons of Russia collusion or obstruction of justice, the Democrats are rewriting the rules of the game as to what they can sell as "guilt" to the public.

Their first move is to discredit Attorney General William Barr as some unreliable agent of President Trump, appointed simply to do Trump's political bidding. CNN, a reliable Democratic media ally, was quick to label Barr's summation of the Mueller Report as "Barr's version," dripping with the implication that it was not to be believed, that the "real truth" lies elsewhere.

Next, the Democrats have demanded the release of the full, unredacted report. Buried in its dense, legal meanderings, the Democrats hope to find several "aha!" passages that they hope will confirm beyond question President Trump's absolute, undeniable guilt of impeachment-worthy crimes.

There are likely none, and the Democrats undoubtedly know that. But they will lower the bar of what constitutes an inexcusable crime (at least to them) and will trumpet their "discovery" to the public — via the ever helpful liberal media — in their vain, pitiable hopes to keep the Trump-collusion matter alive and thus boost the Democrats' presidential electoral prospects in 2020.

The Adam Schiffs and Jerrold Nadlers of the world — reflecting the emotionally unhinged, almost maniacally obsessed refusal of their hardest-core constituents to accept President Trump as the legitimately elected president of the country—will never let the matter go and accept that the facts of the so-called Russia collusion incident point only to its nonexistence.

Instead, cheered on and encouraged by CNN, MSNBC, the N.Y. Times and WaPo, NPR, and all their obedient foot soldiers like Jim Acosta, Rachel Maddow, and Chris Cuomo, the Democrats will continue to shift and adjust downward the standards needed to cry "Guilty!" in the Russia matter.

The goalposts are being moved closer and closer. At some point, the most rank amateur kicker — even an 11-year-old Pee Wee league player — can make a 3-yard field goal. However, a Pee Wee–league field goal doesn't count in the NFL. That's where we are now.

FEATURES
I was browsing the “[GDI] Virtual Reality” group on facebook, and I noticed that someone told that Oculus now allows for referral codes. I was like “yeah, I know, they are available since a lot, but they are a US-only feature” and was about to pass on.

But then, I remembered that after I updated my Oculus runtime, I could now see a “My referral” button, that wasn’t there with my previous version of the Oculus app. So, I decided to give it a try… and with much surprise , I noticed that actually now I am able to send referral codes to friends and families!

A wild new button has appeared in my Oculus desktop app…

What are Oculus referral codes and how do they work?



Referral codes are a great strategy started by Oculus to increase the sales of its headsets. If you are the owner of an Oculus headset and advise a friend of yours to buy an Oculus device, he/she gets a discount on the hardware and you get credit to buy games on the store. So, everyone is happy: you get games, your friend gets a discount, and Oculus gets a new customer. This means that most people having a Rift or a Go will for sure advise all the people they know to buy other Rifts or Go, and so Oculus becomes always more successful.

If you need further details on how it works, these are the official rules:

When your friend purchases Oculus Rift or Oculus Go through your invitation, they will get 10% off their purchase. 30 days following the date your friend’s order is shipped, you’ll automatically get € 30.00 in Oculus Store credit for an Oculus Rift referral or € 20.00 in Oculus Store credit for an Oculus Go referral, applicable towards any software title. Limit 5 monthly invites per user. Oculus Store credits have no cash value, can only be used for purchases of digital content in the Oculus Store, and expire one year from date of issuance. Subject to full terms at oculus.com/legal/store-credits/. You will not receive Oculus Store credit in the event a purchase made through your invitation is returned within thirty (30) days of date of purchase.

Referral codes are currently available for Rift and Go devices. I guess that in the future, they will be available for Quest as well… but there is no official confirmation about it.

Once only US users were able to generate referral codes, but now it seems that this has been extended to many other countries as well. So now I will be able to get some extra credit also from my lovely Italy. Another great thing is that once there was the limit of 3 referral per person, while now every user can generate up to 5 referral codes each month.

If Oculus has extended the rules for referral, it means that they are working very well and are taking many new people in Facebook’s ecosystem.

How do you obtain your referral codes?



It is dead simple:

Go to Oculus’s My Referrals page; Login to your Oculus account, if you weren’t logged in yet; Specify what product you want to invite your friend to buy; Write the e-mail address of your friend; Click Send Invitation.

The Referrals page. As you can see, using it is very simple

At this point, your friend should receive an e-mail with the code and the instructions on how to redeem it. When he/she will buy its Oculus device using the code provided, you will obtain your store credit.

What if you want to buy a new Oculus device, but you don’t have a friend to ask a code to? Well… head to /r/Oculus subreddit and look for the Referral codes megathread … It is a forum thread where people exchange freely their referrals.

I hope this post has been useful for you, and if it is the case, please share it and also subscribe to my newsletter! And after that… if you need a referral code, just let me know!

In a lengthy statement, Swalwell, one of more than a dozen Democrats running for president, said that Barr's news conference was only the latest piece of evidence of bias within the top ranks of the Justice Department

“Barr never should have been confirmed, but once confirmed, he should have recused himself from all oversight of the Mueller investigation,” Swalwell said in a statement.

"Today, he made a show of allegiance to the President over the American people by declaring ‘no collusion’ and excusing the President on the basis of his emotional state," he added. "He has proved that he’s an embedded Trump ally who puts this President’s political future above of the rule of law. That makes him unfit to serve. He must resign.”

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Barr asserted that investigators “found no evidence” that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and explained his decision not to pursue an obstruction of justice case against the president for his conduct related to probe.

A redacted version of the report on Mueller's investigation was released later Thursday morning.

Swalwell, a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, has long been one of Trump's most vocal critics in Congress, frequently chiming in on allegations of impropriety by the president and his campaign.

His demand on Thursday makes him the first 2020 Democrat to call for Barr's resignation in the wake of the Mueller report's release.
Alberta's incoming premier plans to take on environmental charities that he says are blocking exports of the province's oil, but those groups may be saying "Bring it on."

In his victory speech Tuesday, Jason Kenney repeated his promise to fight back against Canadian environmental groups that take money from American foundations with what he says is the covert aim of economic sabotage by preventing Alberta from exporting oil in any direction but south.

"We have been targeted by a foreign-funded campaign of special interests seeking to landlock Canadian energy," Kenney said.

The federal Conservative government under Stephen Harper tried the same thing in 2012 by spending $12 million to audit environmental charities the Tories suspected of breaking the rules. Donations to those charities subsequently skyrocketed.

Donations to the Tides Canada Foundation, audited (and cleared) in 2012, nearly quadrupled. Figures compiled from federal statistics show the group collected $3.7 million in 2012 and nearly $13 million the next year.

"If Mr. Kenney wants to drive tens of millions of dollars to a few environmental groups, to the detriment of 1,200 other environmental charities in Canada, just do what the previous federal Conservatives did," said Mark Blumberg, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in charities.

"It would be a major fundraising coup for these few groups, and terrible for the charity sector."

The Rockefeller Brothers Foundation is one of the groups Kenney has accused of conspiring against Canadian oil. But figures on the group's website show the foundation spends almost six times as much fighting climate change in the U.S. as it does in all other countries combined.

The David Suzuki Foundation, another target, said 90 per cent of its donations come from Canadians — and two-thirds of those are from individuals.

The group LeadNow was investigated by Elections Canada and cleared last October of violating the rules, despite accusations Kenney made Tuesday.

Joshua Hart, who teaches social psychology at New York's Union College, said Kenney's speech fits the technical definition of a conspiracy theory: a small group working in secret to enrich themselves at the expense of others.

It's a way of undermining the legitimacy of critical voices. - Mark Busser , McMaster University

Most people believe in at least one, he said. Some may be true. But Hart said some circumstances are more conducive to their spread than others.

"When people are out of political power or when they feel they aren't in control of circumstances, that's when they'll gravitate toward conspiracy theories."

Mark Busser, who lectures on conspiracy theories at McMaster University, said it works the other way, as well. Successful politicians can use such theories to attack enemies.

"This can be a way of pushing back against trends or social movements that can be out of step with their own policy preferences. It's a way of undermining the legitimacy of critical voices."

'Taking potshots'

The theory first surfaced in the early 2010s but has resurfaced, appearing recently in opinion columns in mainstream media outlets.

Concerns about Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote may have helped bring it back, said David Tindall, a sociologist at the University of British Columbia. But the two issues shouldn't be confused, he said.

Any Russian interference would have been to help a specific political party, Tindall said. Environmental groups work with whichever party advances their interests and sometimes switch allegiances.

"It's not partisan in the same way."

Besides, he said, climate change crosses borders. Canadians and Canadian groups are involved in other countries, as well.

​​​​​​​"Climate change is an international issue and Canadians are involved in international issues elsewhere. What does that matter?"

Blumberg said provincial governments have ways of making life difficult for charities. But it may not be worth it.

"The Conservative overreaction to what was, in the end, a very small number of groups doing things they didn't like was, in the end, very detrimental to Alberta," Blumberg said.

"[The UCP] need to come up with an approach that will actually result in there being progress on the things that the people of Alberta think are important, as opposed to just taking potshots."

They did not receive their own copy of the report but were allowed to take notes, Giuliani added.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump's legal team had early access to the report and discussed it with Justice Department officials.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, a 2020 Democratic presidential underdog, reacted to Attorney General William Barr's Thursday morning remarks on the Mueller report by calling for his immediate resignation, claiming that the investigation had been "tainted."

“He came to this job already biased. Today, he made a show of allegiance to the President over the American people by declaring ‘no collusion’ and excusing the President on the basis of his emotional state," the California congressman said in a press release. "He has proved that he’s an embedded Trump ally who puts this President’s political future above of the rule of law. That makes him unfit to serve. He must resign.”

Swalwell said that special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report "suggests the President obstructed justice, but Barr excused him." The press release did not address Mueller's assessment that President Trump did not collude with the Russian government.

Barr had summarized the findings of the Mueller report in a press conference earlier Thursday. Regarding the 10 instances identified by Mueller as potential obstruction, Barr said that Trump was not seeking to obstruct but rather was "frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks."

Swalwell, who has been an aggressive critic of Trump's relationship with Russia, appeared to be the first 2020 presidential candidate to call for Barr's resignation. Other Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen. Kamala Harris of California, decried Barr's "spin" on the report.

Swalwell announced his bid for the White House on April 8 during an episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."

“I’ve been in Congress for six years, I’ve defended our country from the Intelligence Committee while democracy has been on the ropes ... and I see a country in quicksand, unable to solve problems and threats from abroad, unable to make life better for people here at home. Nothing gets done,” he told Colbert.

A Morning Consult poll released Tuesday did not register any support for Swalwell's candidacy among those surveyed.
For weeks, Jason Kenney framed Alberta's election around three key issues: jobs, pipelines and the economy. With his United Conservative Party soon to take charge, people are looking to him to fulfil his pledge and deliver on all three.

"This democratic decision is a message to all of those Albertans who are struggling," he said in his victory speech. "Help is on the way and hope is on the horizon."

Kenney's challenge is those struggles are rooted in problems that the province has been wrestling with for the last half-decade — difficult problems he accused the outgoing NDP of mishandling.

Now it's his shot.

Struggling oil and natural gas prices, barriers to building new pipelines and stubborn unemployment numbers have become part of the province's economic landscape.

And with commodity prices and pipeline development largely outside his immediate control, it's fair to ask how much Kenney can really do to move Alberta's economic dial.

Voters have placed a big bet on him, but there are no guarantees.

"The current challenges won't go away just because there's a new government," said economist Marie-Christine Bernard, a director with the Conference Board of Canada.

What kind of difference can Kenney make on pipelines, the economy and jobs? Let's look.

Pipelines

The top priority for the oilpatch is building new pipelines and the UCP's plan is to "fight without relent" to do just that. The question is whether it will smooth the road or add hurdles.

Kenney regards Rachel Notley's efforts to win political and public support for pipelines with her carbon tax strategy as a waste of time. Scrapping it is the UCP's Bill 1.

Kenney intends to be more aggressive than his predecessor, including plans to create "turn off the taps" legislation should provinces, like British Columbia, obstruct pipeline construction.

The UCP would hold a referendum in 2021 on removing equalization from the Constitution Act if "substantial progress" hasn't been made on a coastal pipeline.

The UCP also says it will launch a constitutional challenge to Bill C-69, an overhaul of the assessment process for major energy infrastructure in Canada. Kenney calls it the "no more pipelines" bill.

That package seems to have resonated at the polls — but the fate of three key pipelines isn't Kenney's to decide.

Completion of Enbridge's Line 3 is delayed a year (until the second half of 2020) while it waits on U.S. permits. And Keystone XL is fighting a legal battle launched by opponents in American courts.

The decision on whether to proceed with the Trans Mountain expansion rests with the federal government, which bought the project last year when its future was in doubt.

The UCP's tactics could well sway things in Alberta's favour, but it could also harden opponents' resolve and light new political fires.

On Wednesday, Quebec Premier François Legault congratulated Kenney on his electoral victory but reminded him that his province's position on oil pipelines hasn't changed.

"What I am saying is there is no social acceptability for a new oil pipeline in Quebec," he said.

Kenney's distaste for the NDP and federal government's carbon plan could create its own headache.

One reason the federal Liberals got behind Trans Mountain was because of the Alberta NDP's carbon tax policy. With Kenney planning to repeal it — and to fight a national carbon policy — some wonder what the ripple effect may be.

"The federal government has said all along … that pipelines and carbon policy go hand in hand," said Harrie Vredenburg, an energy expert based at the University of Calgary.

"Are the feds going to say no to doing the Trans Mountain expansion in the end? I don't think so. But they could well frustrate an Alberta government who is taking them to court on carbon tax and say, 'Well, we'll just let you chill for a bit and, you know, we'll wait till after the [federal] election.'"

Economy and employment

Diversification has been the watchword of the Alberta economy in recent years, but the energy sector remains key.

The new government can't do much about oil and gas prices, but the UCP hopes it can still lure investment by streamlining regulations and reducing costs on industry. That's welcome news in the oilpatch.

"We think the energy sector can play a unique role in enabling Alberta to regain — and to reset — its position as an investment jurisdiction," said Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

A major pillar of the UCP's election platform is a cut in corporate taxes to eight per cent, down from 12 per cent — a move the party says will grow the economy by $12.7 billion and create 55,000 jobs.

Alberta's economic malaise has taken a toll on jobs and, despite some flirtation with recovery, employment numbers haven't provided much joy recently.

In February, Calgary once again had the highest unemployment rate — 7.6 per cent — out of 33 metropolitan areas in Canada. Edmonton had the third-highest rate, at seven per cent.

"Albertans have elected a government that will be obsessed with getting this province back to work," Kenney said.

One big challenge for the new government is many oilpatch jobs that existed before the downturn are not expected to return — even if oil prices take off again. Companies have found new ways to make do with fewer people.

Still, the UCP believes that its efforts to kick-start the industry will bring back investment and work for both oil and natural gas. It also hopes to spur job creation in forestry, tourism and tech sectors, among others.

"It's true the government doesn't control the price of oil. But what they do control is their response to the economic crisis," said Richard Truscott, of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, in an interview last week.

He urged the incoming provincial government to provide tax relief and less red tape, calling for more flexibility in employment rules and the minimum wage for smaller firms.

The UCP hopes scrapping the NDP's carbon tax plan will also lighten the load on business.

And while it will keep the general minimum wage at $15 an hour, the UCP wants to create a $13 an hour wage for those 17 years of age and under as way to "incentivize" the creation of youth employment.

Will the UCP's plans be enough to breathe new life into the provincial economy? Albertans have high expectations for the next four years — and Kenney helped put them there.

Now that the time for campaign speeches has passed, Albertans will see if it is possible for Kenney to put the province back to work.
A Penn State release announcing 2019 student football season ticket information has confirmed the obvious: The Lions’ annual Whiteout game will take place on Oct. 19 when Michigan comes to town.

It comes as little surprise, considering the biggest Beaver Stadium contest of the year almost always receives Whiteout billing, and the visit from head coach Jim Harbaugh’s team is it.

The game headlines a home slate that includes non-conference visits from Idaho (Aug. 31), Buffalo (Sept. 7), and Pittsburgh (Sept. 14), before Big Ten matchups opposite Purdue on Oct. 5 for Homecoming, Indiana on Nov. 16, and Rutgers on Nov. 30.

Earlier this month, this year’s official Whiteout t-shirt, which says ‘Warning Expect Excessive Noise’ on the front and ‘Penn State Whiteout 2019’ on the back was released.

A short sleeve shirt retails for $26 while a long sleeve goes for $32 on the Fanatics website.

Kick times and most game themes have not yet been announced for the 2019 season, which begins when the Vandals visit on the last day in August.

Other schedule highlights include multiple bye weeks (Sept. 21 and Nov. 2) while the road slate features a Friday night showdown at Maryland to close out September and trips to Iowa (Oct. 12), Michigan State (Oct. 26), Minnesota (Nov. 9), and Ohio State (Nov. 23).

Berlin (AFP)

FC Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has spoken out against the idea of staging Champions League games at the weekend, as suggested in a recent proposal to reform the competition.

"Barcelona's position is clear: national league games must be held at the weekend, and Champions League games during the week," he said in an interview with German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Thursday.

Bartomeu did offer broad support for Champions League reform, however, saying that the competition had to develop.

The controversial reform plans put forward by the European Club Association (ECA) in March envisaged dramatic changes to the Champions League from 2024, ranging from the introduction a three-tiered system to the scheduling of weekend fixtures.

The plans prompted widespread criticism, most notably from the Europe's major domestic leagues, amid fears that they represented the introduction of a European Super League via the back door.

Bartomeu, who sits on the executive board of the ECA, said on Thursday that he saw the plans as an "evolution, not a revolution".

"There are different ideas," he said. "Right now in 2019, we don't know what (the reforms) will look like."

Yet the 56-year-old claimed that he was "against Super Leagues", and insisted that Barcelona would resist weekend fixtures in European competition.

"The Spanish league is very important for us. As a club we need to protect it and ensure that it remains interesting," he said.

Somewhat surprisingly, Bartomeu also said that he "liked" FIFA's plan to expand the Club World Cup to a 24-team competition, which has been met with criticism from the ECA.

The Barcelona said that he was in favour of a "new Club World Cup", but admitted that there was still "need for discussions".

"The clubs and players are the protagonists, so FIFA should listen to them," he said.

"We are the ones who take the risk, who invest in the infrastructure. So we need to talk about the calendar, the format and the distribution of income."

Madonna's New Single, 'Medellin,' Is A Self-Aware Nostalgia Trip

YouTube

The first single from Madonna's upcoming Madame X suggests that the doyenne of dance pop is making canny decisions in her 60th year. "Medellin" is a carefully dosed combination of the coolly narcotic dance-pop she's often made with the track's producer, Mirwais, and the energetic reggaetón of the track's featured guest, the Colombian star Maluma, and suggests this global pop sound will be the foundation of her fourteenth studio album. Starting with a whispered "one, two, cha cha cha" from Queen Madge that lends the arrangement a witty vintage feel, the song proceeds to relate a fantasy that's both sexy and slightly nostalgic. "I took a pill and had a dream," Madonna murmurs, her voice artfully Auto-tuned. "I went back to my seventeenth year."

Madonna's reverie transports her to the Colombian mountain city where, in what some might consider the song's most dubious lyric, she and Maluma have "built a cartel just for love." The line, however, makes sense in the larger scheme of Madame X, due out June 14. The singer promises that the album will have the feel of a spy movie, giving Madonna the chance to inhabit many identities – a few she's listed on Instagram include "a teacher, a nun, a cabaret singer, a saint, a prostitute" and many more. Madonna as secret agent, assuming myriad identities but never settling into one? That's a brilliant way to deal with questions the pop superstar has faced in recent years about both cultural appropriation and her refusal to embrace her status as a mature woman and artist.

The fantasy of "Medellin" could belong to a woman of any age, race or social status. Its dreaminess makes it accessible to all without making any claims on authenticity. Grounded in a minimalist take on reggaetón's ubiquitous tresillo rhythm, "Medellin" lets Madonna lay back in the groove while giving the waggish, husky-voiced Maluma plenty of room to spin out his rhymes in Spanish. Madonna and Mirwais are clearly thinking of "Despacito" here, integrating English and Spanish seamlessly in a song meant for a global marketplace.

Intended to be a celebration of the connections among musicians across borders, Madame X features several other collaborations, some intriguing (the Brazilian singer Anitta) and others possibly a bit on the nose (Diplo, Migos). Madonna has said that the album's global perspective was inspired by her life in Portugal, where she's lived since 2017, but of course, the Latin connection has been a major aspect of her work since her earliest days. "Medellin" is, in some ways, a return to her happy place, definitively portrayed in her 1986 single "La Isla Bonita" — only this time with a woozy feel more redolent of a time when synthetic drugs and virtual realities dominate the cultural conversation. Let's hope the rest of Madame X is this playful and charming.
Magic: The Gathering, the original collectible card game, is gearing up for an epic showdown. A massive narrative arc will soon come to a close with the publication of a new novel. Its release will coincide with the launch of War of the Spark, the game’s 81st set of cards. Nic Kelman, the head of story and entertainment at Wizards of the Coast (WotC), says that this is a climax that will change the game’s multiverse forever.

Recently, Kelman sat down with Polygon to share the details of a brand-new product, a so-called Signature Spellbook, and to pore over the details of a moment years in the making. He says that in the coming days, a fan-favorite character will die. He also indicated that, unlike in some other fictional universes, this character won’t be coming back.

[Warning: This article contains major spoilers for the storyline of Magic: The Gathering.]

The upcoming novel is called War of the Spark: Ravnica and is written by Greg Weisman (Gargoyles, Star Wars Rebels). It tells the story of a battle between the evil Nicol Bolas, the youngest and most powerful of Magic’s seven Elder Dragons, and the Gatewatch, a loose alliance of Planeswalkers fighting on the side of good.

The setting for the battle is the plane of Ravnica, one of the most populous realms in the Magic multiverse and the location for the game’s most recent sets of cards. Bolas isn’t alone. He’s brought with him many other powerful Planeswalkers to aid him in his struggle for control. In total, Kelman says the novel will feature more than 120 named characters from throughout the franchise’s 25-year history.

And, in that battle’s final moments, one of those characters will sacrifice himself for the greater good.

“Gideon Jura will die,” Kelman said.

Gideon first appeared in the Zendikar block of cards, where he showed up as a Planeswalker in 2010’s the Rise of the Eldrazi set. His powers have traditionally been drawn from white mana, long associated with order and justice. Kelman says that, as far as Magic’s ongoing narrative is concerned, Gideon has been “the point around which the other Planeswalkers of the Gatewatch rallied.”

“People know that multiple characters are going to die [in this novel],” Kelman continued. “They just don’t know who. Gideon, we think, will have by far the biggest impact. He’s certainly the most pivotal death in the story.”

To celebrate Gideon’s life, WotC is issuing a special set of reprinted cards called a Signature Spellbook. It’s only the second time in the history of the franchise that the publisher has done so. Gideon’s Signature Spellbook consists of eight cards pulled from the long history of Magic, and seven of them contain entirely new art.

Polygon spoke with Gavin Verhey, a former professional Magic player and now a designer at WotC, to discuss the importance of each of these cards and give insight on how fans will be able to use them in their decks.

The first card in the set is Gideon Jura, Legendary Planeswalker. It’s the same card that first appeared in 2010, complete with an updated portrait, which came somewhat later. Verhey describes the card as a “powerhouse,” and expects it to become a staple of many Magic formats in the near future.

“This card was always the emblematic version of Gideon,” Verhey said. His low loyalty cost makes him easy to work with right out of the gate, and allows players to “take some of the heat” off themselves while they bring other creatures and spells into play.

“It’s kind of a fun design thing,” Verhey said. “You can put him down and quickly plus him. Your opponent is forced to attack, and then Gideon makes some blocks or something like that. And then, on the next turn, you can minus two and kill off one of the creatures that your opponent attacked with, which, to me, really is Gideon’s flavor.”

The next card in the set is an enchantment called Martyr’s Bond, which forces opponents to sacrifice permanents against their will.

“This is a white Commander staple,” Verhey said, referring to the dynamic format of Magic that includes decks of 100 cards, all of which are unique, and allows up to six players at one time. “Anytime something that you have dies, all of your opponents sacrifice something. This is huge because, in Commander, you’re playing this big multiplayer game. There’s a lot of destruction rolling around. A lot of people will try and attack you. The card simultaneously says, ‘Don’t attack me.’ It also says, ‘Don’t mess with my stuff.’”

Next up is a card that can be played at any time, an instant spell called Path to Exile. With it players can effectively remove any target creature from the game. The only cost is a single white mana — and allowing your opponent to bring a new land into the game.

“This is, simply put, one of the best white removal spells ever printed in the entirety of Magic’s history,” Verhey said.

Rest in Peace is the set’s second enchantment, and perhaps its most powerful one. It was first printed with the Return to Ravnica set in 2012.

“This is what we call a hammer card,” Verhey said. “If your partner’s playing a graveyard strategy, you play Rest in Peace and it just shuts them down. It gets rid of all the cards in their graveyard, and it gets rid of all future cards in all graveyards. So it’s interesting to play in a number of different contexts.”

Next up is an aura-type enchantment called Shielded by Faith. It allows players to transfer the indestructible keyword to any new creature that they field. That means once the aura is in play, players can be relatively assured that at least one of their most expensive creatures will be able to stand up against most anything their opponent can throw at them.

Shielded by Faith pairs well with the next card in the set, True Conviction. Its lifelink ability allows players to earn life for any damage their creatures mete out. Combined with double strike, which allows creatures to attack twice, it’s an easy way to boost yourself to extremely high life totals.

Played at just the right time, it’s possible to reach 100 or more in the blink of an eye using True Conviction, according to Verhey.

Worship, the next element of the deck, is another card that’s very difficult to counter. Once in play, so long as its owner has at least one creature they control, any damage that would bring them below 1 life brings them back to 1 life instead. Combined with a card like Shielded by Faith, which provides the indestructible keyword, it can be very difficult to counter.

“This is a card that, if your opponent puts it down, you start getting a little concerned,” Verhey said. “It’s so easy to set up a lock where you opponent can’t really kill you off anymore.”

The final card in the set is a legendary artifact, a newer piece of equipment known as the Blackblade Reforged. Inexpensive to summon onto the battlefield, it only costs an additional 3 mana to equip it to a legendary creature. Once in play, it gives that creature +1/+1 for each land that the player controls.

The card itself is already part of the Dominaria set, which was released just last year. The real treasure here, Verhey explained, is the artwork itself. The mystical, soul-drinking weapon has been a mainstay of the Magic lore for years now. It was only recently reforged, only to be carried into battle by Gideon himself. For this rendering, WotC called on Richard Kane Ferguson, the artist who originally created its iconic look.

Nic Kelman, head of story and entertainment at Wizards of the Coast, takes no pleasure in killing off one of Magic’s most beloved characters. For him, the real joy comes in completing an epic storyline that will bring the most popular CCG in the world forward into the second half of its third decade.

“This storyline, this conclusion, the story arc — and specifically, the War of the Spark conclusion — was kind of architected years ago, before I even got here,” Kelman said. “For me, for certain pieces, it’s been more making sure that we follow through on the execution as well as possible.”

He also acknowledges that 2019 marks not one but two other climactic battles in popular fiction, both in the Marvel and the Star Wars cinematic universes. WotC’s goal, as in all things, is to make sure that its characters and its storylines stand apart.

“This was actually mapped out before anybody even know there was going to be an Infinity War, let alone the conclusion of the second part of it, at almost the same time,” Kelman said. “It is an epic battle with lots of characters, but that’s kind of where the similarity ends. [...] I think the key difference is probably that in comics or in films [...] it’s unusual for death to have real stakes. I will say that we consider ourselves more in the fantasy literature tradition. If a character dies, they’re probably dead, as opposed to the comic or an epic film.”

Gideon’s Signature Spellbook will go on sale soon. The War of the Spark card set goes on sale in the digital version of the game, Magic: The Gathering — Arena, on April 25. Physical cards will arrive in stores and on Amazon on April 27.

Correction: This story originally said that the card Rest in Peace would be legal for Standard play. That is not the case. We have adjusted the article to reflect that.

Jeremy Vuolo gets real about his married life with wife Jinger Duggar as he spills he gets tempted with impure thoughts.

Reality star Jinger Duggar and her soccer star husband Jeremy Vuolo tied the knot two years back in 2016 shortly after their courtship and welcomed their first child, Felicity Nicole Vuolo together last year.

Whilst all the relationship of celebrities always don't come off perfect as shown on screen, Jinger and Jeremy fall on the same category as well.

In the recent interview alongside family Jeremy and Audrey Roloff for a new Behind The Scenes podcast episode, the couple became utterly honest to talk about their married life.

SOURCE: The Stir

Jeremy starts explaining after his wife brings up the topic of purity and communication issue the couple faces upon their marital relationship. In fact, the two were most honest whilst discussing the temptation the 31 years old star experiences at times.

Vuolo reveals that he wanted his wife to be with him on the journey of purity since their wedding, despite it's not being easy for the two to have a conversation on such a delicate topic.

The 'Counting On' reality star adds that it somewhat helps him "to be able to say, ‘hey I’m getting hit with some temptation or I’m just struggling this morning with this or that."

Jeremy then talks about how he thought his struggle with his impure thought might actually hurt his wife, whilst in reality, it's the exact opposite. "It actually builds her trust," he says.

In delight of their marriage affair, their honesty and loyalty are what helped their relationship prosper and survive.

Jeremy is not ashamed of sharing his impure thoughts that come across his minds with Jinger and in return, it's great how she helps him to battle them.

The pair met through Jinger sister, Jessa Duggar and her husband Ben Seewald and instantly fell for each other after a few months despite admitting the two were afraid they both thought they wouldn't be interested in one another.

Jinger later realized that her future husband secured all the qualities she seeks for in her life partner. Luckily for her, Jeremy liked her back.
Attorney General Bill Barr held a news conference Thursday morning to discuss special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.



Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller examined 10 episodes involving President Donald Trump when trying to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.





Barr also said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein disagreed with some of Mueller's "legal theories" involving potential obstruction and that the "publicly released report will allow every American to understand" the conclusions of the investigation.



DOJ officials said the report will be released to Congress after Barr's appearance, during the 11 a.m. hour. President Trump said he may follow up with his own news conference.



"Attorney General Barr's regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report, including his slanted March 24th summary letter, his irresponsible testimony before Congress last week, and his indefensible plan to spin the report in a press conference later this morning — hours before he allows the public or Congress to see it — have resulted in a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement Thursday morning.



In outlining the decision not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice, the attorney general said he considered the “unprecedented situation” the president faced entering office. Barr said:





A.G. WILLIAM BARR: Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.

The president tweeted after the news conference:
LD: Admire Trump as much as you want, but at least have the honesty to admit that the man is a Zionist stooge who loves Israel, like most American Jews, more than he loves America. Having moved the American embassy to Jerusalem and decided that the Golan Heights, contrary to international law, should be ceded to Israel, Trump now goes one step further in stating that Israel should be exempt from the judgments of the International Criminal Court. In other words, Israel must not be held responsible for its war crimes. It needs to be “aggressive” for its own good and is therefore beyond international law. Give Trump a chance and he will soon be telling us that “Evil is good”, at least when Israel does it. (LD)

“Bibi, my friend . . .”

“Israel is very special to me. A special country, a special people. We are very much in favor of what Israel does. They are aggressive and they have no choice but to be aggressive. Bibi, my friend . . . we are with Israel 100 per cent” — Quote from video below

Trump says Israelis should be immune

from International Criminal Court prosecution

APRIL 12, 2019 1:17 PM

By Ron Kampeas

Jewish Telegraph Agency via Truthseeker

WASHINGTON (JTA) — The Trump administration again named Israelis along with Americans as deserving immunity from International Criminal Court prosecution.

In a statement Friday, President Donald Trump declared victory after the International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected a request to investigate U.S. personnel for actions in Afghanistan.

“Since the creation of the International Criminal Court, the United States has consistently declined to join the court because of its broad, unaccountable prosecutorial powers; the threat it poses to American national sovereignty; and other deficiencies that render it illegitimate,” the White House said in a statement it attributed to Trump. “Any attempt to target American, Israeli, or allied personnel for prosecution will be met with a swift and vigorous response.”

It’s the second time that the Trump administration has extended its vow to protect allies from the court explicitly to Israelis. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said ICC officials who prosecute Americans or Israelis would be denied entry into the United States.

The ICC is known to be considering whether to act on a request by the Palestinian Authority to investigate Israeli officials for war crimes. Like the United States, Israel is not a member of the court and thus its citizens are susceptible to court action only if they are in countries that belong to the ICC.

Why does The New York Times take rich liberals at their word that their concern with Bernie Sanders is that he would lose to Trump, rather than the obvious, glaring fact that his election would run counter to their interests?

The New York Times (4/16/19) profiled a network of “wealthy liberal donors” who, shockingly, are not fans of Bernie Sanders, who according to the same report has rejected their big-bundler funding and instead opted for small donations. (The Times reported the same day that 84 percent of Sanders’ donations are less than $200; by contrast, only 37 percent of Kamala Harris’ donations are.)

That a network of multi-millionaire and billionaire donors would dislike a candidate who not only rejects their funding, but is actively trying to tax them at rates not seen since 1960, would surely be enough reason to explain why these wealthy elites would want to “stop” his nomination. But not to the credulous New York Times, which takes at face value rich donors’ claim to oppose Sanders because they believe he simply can’t defeat Trump:

Mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried that their effort to defeat President Trump in 2020 could be complicated by Mr. Sanders…. “Some in the party still harbor anger over the 2016 race, when he ran against Hillary Clinton, and his ongoing resistance to becoming a Democrat. But his critics are chiefly motivated by a fear that nominating an avowed socialist would all but ensure Mr. Trump a second term.”

For the wealthy, ideology simply doesn’t exist. No, they’re just Very Concerned about fielding the Best Candidate.

Because it would be unseemly to suggest a group of super-rich hedge fund managers, Hollywood producers and CEOs would dislike a candidate who has made a career out of promising to expropriate the bulk of their wealth, we get a faux pragmatism argument. But polls show Sanders defeating Trump with numbers comparable to any other declared candidate—a fact The New York Times never bothers to mention, letting the idea go unchallenged that “socialist” (!!) Sanders is an electoral liability. The simpler, less altruistic motive is simply never entertained.

It’s a variation on the Inexplicable Republican Best Friend trope FAIR previously documented (2/26/19): Instead of assuming that lifelong conservatives may just prefer more conservative politicians, progressive-bashing GOP pundits are propped up as neutral observers simply looking out for the Democratic Party. Just the same, super-wealthy Democratic donors can’t oppose Sanders because they simply prefer more centrist, pro-Wall Street candidates; they must have a sincere, pragmatic concern he would lose the general election.

Throughout the article, the Times’ Jonathan Martin bizarrely used “mainstream Democrats” and “Democrats” to refer to what is little more than a clique of wealthy donors. “Mainstream Democrats are increasingly worried” he tells us. “Stopping Mr. Sanders,” he added, “or at least preventing a contentious convention, could prove difficult for Democrats.”

But why would “Democrats” want to “stop Mr. Sanders”? Sanders has a 78 percent favorability rating among Democrats and leads every poll among declared candidates. Martin is, of course, not talking about “Democrats” or “mainstream Democrats”; he’s talking about rich donors. But because it would be vulgar to mention their obvious class interests, they morph into simply “Democrats” without explanation.

Martin then advances the curious construction that super-wealthy donors blatantly conspiring to prevent Sanders from winning the nomination––and even resorting to undemocratic superdelegates at the Democratic National Convention to do so—“plays into the hands” of Sanders:The idea that the interests of millionaire film producer Rufus Gifford—who’s heavily quoted in the article as a stand-in for “Democrats”—would run counter to those of the average voter is glossed over entirely. Why would guy who made Daddy Day Care and Doctor Dolittle 2 be given a voice by the Times instead of, say, literally any random person picked off the street?

Mr. Gifford, who has gone public in recent days with his dismay over major Democratic fundraisers remaining on the sidelines, said of Mr. Sanders, “I feel like everything we are doing is playing into his hands.”

But doing out in the open the thing Sanders says Democrats do isn’t “playing into his hands”; it’s true that it affirms his core ideological proposition, that the wealthy have too much political power, but what it mainly is is the wealthy using that power against him.

A similar gambit is used when liberal publications hand-wring that Trump and Rubio openly threatening and planning to invade Venezuela “plays into Maduro’s hands,” and that’s why it’s bad. In fact, it’s bad because the things being discussed, invasion and coup-mongering, are bad things—and they’re not “playing into Maduro’s hands,” they’re actual threats to the sovereignty and lives of those in Venezuela.

Trying to distract attention from the sinister thing happening before everyone’s eyes by commenting that it has some meta, second-order effect of increasing left-wing paranoia is an attempt to smear the left for correctly calling the sky blue.

Rich donor broker and Clinton-hatchet man David Brock, in the very last line of the article, attempts this sleight-of-hand again:

“You can see him reading the headlines now,” Mr. Brock mused: “‘Rich people don’t like me.’”

Simply drawing attention to the fact that a bunch of wealthy donors affirms Sanders primary argument for running doesn’t make it go away. It’s a writer’s trick, and one The New York Times passes off without criticism: LOL Isn’t it ironic we’re doing that bad, evil thing Sanders says rich donors do?

Wait, what? No, it’s just bad, in and of itself. The piece is openly floating a conspiracy of wealthy donors seeking to undermine a democratic process, then laughing it off something that could be mistaken for the actual bad thing it is. Meanwhile, the self-evident fact that rich donors dislike Sanders because he runs counter to their interests is ignored in favor of a child-like fantasy that they oppose him simply because they’re looking out for the best interests of the party.

To the Times, the rich have no ideology, no beliefs, no self interest; this is reserved instead for Sanders “embolden[ed],” “fervent supporters,” whose desire to defeat Trump is presented as at best incidental.
Gasly has had a difficult start to the campaign, but managed to score his best result of the season with sixth place – plus grab fastest lap – in the Chinese Grand Prix.

But although Gasly still has some way to go before he is able to properly challenge teammate Max Verstappen, Horner has faith that the issues the Frenchman is suffering from are being overcome.

“I think he has made a step forward this weekend,” said Horner. “I think he is still not totally comfortable within the car at the moment, not from a physical fitting, but I think he is in the process of needing to refine his style to optimise the best from the characteristics of the car.

“I think it is obviously proving to be a challenge for him, but he is making progress and the fastest lap at the end of the race will give him some confidence as well.”

Gasly was pitted late for soft tyres in China so he could gun for the fastest lap of the race – which he took by just one tenth on the final lap.

Asked if Gasly could have gone quicker to be more sure of bagging the extra point, Horner said: “He knew the laptime he needed to beat because we told him when he went out of the pits.

“But we see after the pit stops, both Ferrari and Mercedes, it looks like they go back into a qualifying setting, particularly Sebastian [Vettel]. His one lap pace showed he did a 34.8s and then suddenly he is in the 36s. There is one standout lap.”

Gasly said his lonely run to finish sixth in China did at least allow him to experiment more with his driving style to try to extract more from the car.

“I think there's still a lot of work to do,” he said. “I was quite alone for all the race, so I tried many different things with the driving, trying to understand what I can do inside the car to go around the main thing I still struggle with and get some more answers.

“But I think we know what to improve, I know what to improve also on my side. So hopefully we're going to do a step better each weekend.”

The almost decade-long hiatus in high-level meetings between Baltic presidents and Russia’s Vladimir Putin is set to end this week.

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — home to sizable Russian-speaking minorities — have had an uneasy relationship with the Kremlin since communism collapsed. Putin’s annexation of Crimea from nearby Ukraine in 2014 and the ensuing military conflict further spooked a region that was once an unwilling part of the USSR and is now part of the European Union, the euro area and NATO.

Friendship won’t be blossoming any time soon — the three countries are among the staunchest backers of EU sanctions against Russia over Ukraine.

But a meeting Thursday in Moscow between Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid and Putin marks a slight improvement in tone.

“I’d rather be at the table than on the menu,” she told a news conference this month.

The Motorola Moto G7 Plus may launch on T-Mobile in the US

Motorola may have been crushed by the strong forces of Chinese brands in the East but it still serves as a reasonable option in markets like LATAM and the U.S. This is primarily because it is among the most reliable names, especially in the budget segment. One of three new models of Moto G7 series which are available in the U.S. can be considered if you’re planning to be kind to your wallet while buying a new smartphone. But don’t make your mind just yet, as Motorola could be announcing the fourth and the most powerful device out of the bunch – Moto G7 Plus – in the U.S.

Moto G7 Plus XDA Forums

Recently, a Motorola device bearing model number “XT1965-T” passed through the FCC. Since we know that “XT1965” denotes the Moto G7 Plus, we are hopeful that the smartphone should soon arrive in the U.S. and join the other three models in the series i.e. Moto G7 Play, Moto G7 Power, and the Moto G7.

The addition of “T” in the moniker points that the Moto G7 Plus could be released via T-Mobile in the U.S. This piece of information can also be confirmed by the operator’s mention as the brand name in the general information page. Through this page, we also know that the T-Mobile Moto G7 Plus will come with dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC.

However, there is an anomaly in the listing that makes us feel that listing might have some errors. The IMEI codes listed in FCC’s report correspond to the Moto G7 instead of the Moto G7 Plus. We face a similar predicament while witnessing a device with model number “XT1965-3”, which is most likely the unlocked version of the G7 Plus, but the IMEI codes correspond to Moto G7 too, making things even more confusing.

We’ll update the article when we learn positively about the launch of Moto G7 Plus in the U.S. Meanwhile, we have concrete information that the smartphone will soon support Night Vision, a feature which can be expected to enhance images in low light.

According to a study published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association researchers found that patients who regularly use cannabis may require more than two times the usual level of sedation when undergoing medical procedures.

The Colorado based research team examined medical records of 250 patients who received endoscopic procedures after 2012, when the state legalized recreational Cannabis. The team looked at several common sedatives including — fentanyl, midazolam and propofol.

They found that patients who smoked or ingested Cannabis on a daily or weekly basis required 14% more fentanyl, 20% more midazolam, and 220% more propofol to achieve adequate sedation.

Based on the limited knowledge and lack of research we have on Cannabis, doctors are becoming increasingly concerned. Dr. Mark Twardowski, an internal medicine physician and his colleagues decided to conduct this research as they began noticing more patients reporting with complaints of chronic nausea, a symptom that can occur from regular cannabis use.

Dr. Twardowski and his colleagues also began to see that these very patients were requiring more sedation and experiencing more post-op seizures, prompting them to gather some data.

According to Dr. Twardowski, “Cannabis has some metabolic effects we don’t understand and patients need to know that their cannabis use might make other medications less effective. We’re seeing some problematic trends anecdotally, and there is virtually no formal data to provide a sense of scale or suggest any evidence-based protocols.”

With Cannabis use growing at a rapid rate, physicians should bare caution. With the lack of research available more studies similar to this must be conducted. Luckily, as more states begin legalizing recreational cannabis it may be easier to gather the necessary data.

Not only are more patients using Cannabis, they are also willing to admit that they are using it. With that being said it will be much easier for physicians to gather information and conduct the necessary research to advance patient care.

Questions: Do you know anyone who consumes Cannabis routinely? What are the best ways to inform those who consume Cannabis about the conclusions of this research?

Judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler says it was ‘disingenuous and misleading’ of Barr to say Trump is ‘clear of wrongdoing’
Our house is on fire. I am here to say, our house is on fire.

According to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), we are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. In that time, unprecedented changes in all aspects of society need to have taken place, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50%.

And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale. Nor does it include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost.

Teenage activist takes School Strikes 4 Climate Action to Davos Read more

At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And on climate change, we have to acknowledge we have failed. All political movements in their present form have done so, and the media has failed to create broad public awareness.

But Homo sapiens have not yet failed.



Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands. But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don’t stand a chance.

We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly.

Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases.

Either we do that or we don’t.

You say nothing in life is black or white. But that is a lie. A very dangerous lie. Either we prevent 1.5C of warming or we don’t. Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control or we don’t.

Either we choose to go on as a civilisation or we don’t. That is as black or white as it gets. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival.

We all have a choice. We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations. Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail.

That is up to you and me.

Some say we should not engage in activism. Instead we should leave everything to our politicians and just vote for a change instead. But what do we do when there is no political will? What do we do when the politics needed are nowhere in sight?

Here in Davos – just like everywhere else – everyone is talking about money. It seems money and growth are our only main concerns.

And since the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, people are simply not aware of the full consequences on our everyday life. People are not aware that there is such a thing as a carbon budget, and just how incredibly small that remaining carbon budget is. That needs to change today.

No other current challenge can match the importance of establishing a wide, public awareness and understanding of our rapidly disappearing carbon budget, that should and must become our new global currency and the very heart of our future and present economics.

I'm striking from school to protest inaction on climate change – you should too | Greta Thunberg Read more

We are at a time in history where everyone with any insight of the climate crisis that threatens our civilisation – and the entire biosphere – must speak out in clear language, no matter how uncomfortable and unprofitable that may be.

We must change almost everything in our current societies. The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty. The bigger your platform, the bigger your responsibility.

Adults keep saying: “We owe it to the young people to give them hope.” But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.

I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.

In our Nexus article last month, we outlined some experimental ARAM changes we wanted you to try out during our “Back to Bilgewater” mini-event. Now that the event is over, it’s time to go over how the changes fared and which ones are coming back with us to the Howling Abyss based on your feedback and our data. What’s Going Away Champion Bans Removing bans was a really tough decision that we discussed a lot internally. Bans provide a real feeling of satisfaction and reduce frustration by helping you feel like you’re in control of your destiny, especially when you can remove that one champ you just don’t want to face. This was especially true before the balance changes (which we’re keeping), since certain champions were just so far out of line in terms of power. But it also had some side effects. ARAM has always been the less competitive mode for players to enjoy League characters in a slightly more chill setting. But the bans were so targeted to a select group of champions that we saw an overall decrease in champion diversity. For players who just wanted to reroll for those champs, and didn’t care about having a perfectly balanced experience, it now felt like they were never available. Our goal isn’t to change what ARAM is to most players, and the bans almost took away the whole purpose of it to them. Finally it also adds another 30 seconds to “getting into game” time, which is something we want to keep quick for this mode.

So for now we’re going to remove it. A lot of the champs that were frequently banned (Brand, Veigar, Lux) have now been adjusted, making them more fair to play against. We’d like to give players some time to play ARAM with the balance changes and see if they feel that these ban-worthy champions are still qualified as such. By removing bans, we can also get a better look at how the things we decided to keep affect ARAM over a longer period (champ balance, runes adjustments, anti-poke, etc.). How will these impact ARAM over the next few months? Once we see a bit more of that long-term effect, we can take another look at bans in ARAM and go from there. For now though, we think this is the right call. Experimental Items: Mariner’s Vengeance and Ghostwalkers Now that we’ve done mini-ARAM events twice, we’re convinced that new items are great for adding some unique flair to the mode for a short time. For example, Mariner’s Vengeance and Ghostwalkers thematically fit Butcher’s Bridge and made this event’s ARAM feel more distinct from the main-stay Howling Abyss. But we don’t think they’re great for the long-term health of the mode. Ghostwalkers would likely need some large improvements to make sure it was much more clear where the person using them was. And Mariner’s Vengeance would have to be specifically adjusted to avoid some really odd interactions with champs like Kled and Shaco. For now these items won’t be permanent, but they might come back for future events. Experimental Summoner Spell: Backtrack Our goal with Backtrack was give melee champs the option to engage fights and then get back out quickly. We saw some great success here with champs like Malphite, Jarvan IV, and Talon, as well as strong-regen champs like Garen and Dr. Mundo, who’d use it to get out and regen back to full HP. However, we didn’t want to give the already-strong ranged champions an even stronger escape or defensive tool. While weak on some champs, Backtrack was the highest win rate Summoner Spell for ranged champions like Kog’maw and Brand.

Champion Win Rate by Summoner Spell

If we revisit this spell in the future, we’d experiment with making Backtrack similar to Barrier for ranged champions, and only give the backtrack aspect to melee champions. But for now, we’ve decided to drop this summoner spell. What’s Here to Stay Runes Adjustment

The rune changes have been quite successful. Triumph and Presence of Mind are no longer must-take runes, and now you can actually make an argument that Magical Footwear might be more gold efficient than Triumph. Same goes for Scorch vs. Gathering Storm: If your game goes longer than 21 minutes, Gathering Storm is actually a good choice now! We think it will take time for people to discover the truly optimal rune choices after the changes, so we’re going to keep an eye on things and give everyone time to explore the possibilities. We’re open to making further adjustments to runes as needed. Champion Balance Our specific goal with champion balance in ARAM—which is something players have been asking for for a long time—was to preserve the state and meta of ARAM, but make games less decided at champ select. This means that champions like Sona and Ziggs are still some of the strongest champs in ARAM, but not quite game-defining like they were before. So how did we do? Let’s check out this handy-dandy graph, showing the number of champions at each win rate in patch 9.6 and 9.7.

Turns out, it looks pretty good! We believe reducing the range of champ win rates from 32-67% to 43-57% results in a much better world. Champions like Teemo, Sona, and Ziggs are still some of the strongest choices, but now if you play well or get a good team comp, you can actually beat them! Now that we have these balance levers, we’ll be keeping an eye on ARAM to tune champions a little more often. We don’t want to commit to every patch or anything, but you should see the occasional balance adjustment in the Patch Notes in the future. In addition, we’ll always keep this Boards post updated with the current status of champions. We’ve made a few more minor adjustments to balance for patch 9.8, but now we should be good for awhile. Built-In Poke Reduction The goal of this change specifically was to make you feel not as bad when opponents are poking you out. Many champions have the ability to poke without much counterplay, and we wanted to make it so that the game is not immediately decided at loading screen when you see five ranged poke champions on the enemy team. From what we’ve seen, this (coupled with the champion balance changes) is working pretty well, so we are going to keep it. However, the range is actually calculated when the damage makes contact, which often led to cases where you would shoot a spell, take a step back, and then you trigger the poke reduction. To address this, we’re increasing the range required to trigger the reduction: Damage from champions further than 900 1000 units away is reduced by 15% (this excludes ultimates and damage over time abilities). Game Adjustment: Less Drawn-Out Games

Our goal for these changes was to NOT shorten most games. Games that would normally end quickly shouldn’t have been made any faster. We were focused on the long games that went for more than 25 minutes, trying to pull those games in and make sure they actually end. With that goal in mind, it seems like we did exactly what we set out to do. The quickest 50% of ARAM games were basically the same length before and after the event, which is good. The slowest 10% of games had their length cut dramatically. While this was a big success, we do feel we swung a little hard, as we didn’t want the change to be quite that severe. So we are going to be keeping these changes with a few small number adjustments: From game start to 15:00, minion waves spawn every 25 seconds as normal. At 15:00, spawn rate begins increasing at a linear rate, capping at 25:00 when they’ll spawn every 15 seconds. (Unchanged.)

From game start to 15:00, minions have 325 movement speed as normal. At 15:00, they start gaining movement speed every minute until 20:00 25:00 when they’ll have 425 movement speed. (Slowed down how quickly the minions ramp in speed.)

From game start to 15:00, champions deal 10% 0% more damage to structures. At 15:00, that value increases linearly until 25:00 when they’ll deal 30% 15% bonus damage to structures. (Removed early tower bonus damage and halved it late game.) Warmog’s Armor Changes Last but not least… Warmog’s. The changes we made to Warmog’s were quite successful: They made the item not quite as strong, but still viable for champs that benefit from the repeated sustain. Unique builds like Warmog’s Soraka are still viable, but they don’t constantly keep the champion at 100% health and make you feel powerless as the opponent. So new Warmog’s is here to stay! That’s it for now. We hope you enjoyed this mini-event and that these changes lead to a more fun ARAM! Feel free to reach out and let us know what you think. Until next time, have fun on the Howling Abyss.

If you're curious about the new book coming out in October, we got a nice early review here.
Episodes 1 and 2 Out Now Click Below To Watch

Forget about that August 2, 2019, North American release date for The New Mutants. The release date for The New Mutants, which is based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name, has been moved again, according to a source at Fox.

The original release date for The New Mutants, which began filming in July of 2017, was April 13, 2018. This was moved to February 22, 2019, before landing on the most recent date.

A new release date has yet to be determined for The New Mutants, according to the Fox source. “The film is being moved because of the Disney-Fox merger,” says the source. “They want to wait until the merger is completed before they make decisions about the release of certain films, including The New Mutants.”

While the source declined to say whether or not the release date for The New Mutants will be moved completely out of 2019, this would seem to be almost a certainty, given that Fox is, reportedly, still demanding reshoots, which have yet to get underway. “The new release date will be far away from August,” says the source. “Nothing else is known at this point.”

The New Mutants, which has been described as a horror film in the superhero genre, is directed by Josh Boone, who co-wrote the screenplay with Knate Lee and has compared the film to Rosemary’s Baby and The Shining.

Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga, Blu Hunt, and Alice Braga star in the film, which focuses on a group of young mutants who are being held in a secret facility and have to fight to save themselves.
Reigning two-time Formula 1 Esports Series champion Brendon Leigh will make his single-seater racing debut in the Avon Tyres BRSCC National Formula Ford 1600 championship, joining Kevin Mills Racing part-time.

Leigh, who competes for Mercedes-AMG Petronas Esports in the virtual F1 series, will race of KMR’s Specturms at the National FF1600 season opener at Snetterton. He will also compete at the following one-day meeting at Oulton Park, with further sporadic appearances possible later in the year.

Though Snetterton will be Leigh’s first taste of FF1600 racing, the 19-year-old has already done three days of testing with KMR in preparation for his debut, with team boss Kevin Mills suggesting he already has the pace to perform well.

“He was fast straight away,” said Mills of Leigh’s test runs. “He wasn’t too different to my other two drivers [Neil Maclennan and Michael Macpherson] really. His lap times were fairly similar. He’ll go well.

“I don’t know about his racecraft and being used to having 20 other cars all around him but certainly speed-wise, he’s compared quite well with my other two [drivers].

Leigh already has some real-life racing experience having competed for a place in the Race of Champions over the past two years, most recently narrowly losing out to fellow sim racer James Baldwin.

Despite his high profile in sim racing, Mills didn’t realise he was dealing with an Esports champion when giving him his first test.

“He just asked to come and do a test two months ago. I didn’t even know who he was – my son knew who he was, I didn’t know!” Mills said.

“He tested and he went quite well. I thought it would just be a one-off but then he came back and did two more days and he was very good again.”

Leigh is the second driver in as many years to switch from online racing to FF1600. Sebastian Job won a drive with B-M Racing last season through the JMR Scholarship.

Job, who is now a Red Bull Racing Esports driver alongside former Scottish FF1600 champion and Walter Hayes Trophy winner Graham Carroll, scored a best result of fifth place at Kirkistown in the National championship last year.
Road vs Street



You might wonder what the big difference between road and street is as both are used often as if synonymous. There is, of course, some difference between road and street. One of the key differences between road and street is that a road runs between two distant points. The two distant points can be two different towns too. In other words, it can be said that a road connects two different places or towns, whereas a street is a small public road that is well within a city or town. Road comes from the Old English word rād while street comes from the Old English word strǣt. This article attempts to explain to you the difference between road and street as clearly as possible.

What does Road mean?

While streets are more used by people roads are used by vehicles. Roads are specially prepared surfaces for vehicle use. Hence, it is true that you would find more traffic on a road than in a street. While a street does not have many official buildings and such, you would find more of these, official buildings, business establishments and other buildings, on roads. This is one of the primary reasons why you find more traffic on roads than in the streets. Roads contain movie theaters, cultural centers and other amusement and entertainment centers than streets. You cannot very easily locate an address on a road because of its massive length and size. You would not find that many markets on a road as roads are built for vehicles to travel and markets should be built somewhere people have the freedom to walk leisurely.

What does Street mean?

A Street is generally lined with houses on both sides whereas you do not see many houses on the sides of a road. More people generally use the street to traverse. A Street does not have many official buildings, business establishments and other buildings. Unlike in a road that is massive in length and size, you can locate an address quite easily in a street. Since streets are used primarily by people on foot, it is quite possible that streets have markets such as vegetable market, fish market and other types of markets.

What is the difference between Road and Street?

• A road connects two different places or towns, whereas a street is a small public road that is well within a city or town.

• While streets are more used by people roads are used by vehicles.

• While a street does not have many official buildings and such, you would find more of these, official buildings, business establishments and other buildings, on roads.

• A Street is generally lined with houses on both sides whereas you do not see many houses on the sides of a road.

• Since streets are used primarily by people on foot, it is quite possible that streets have markets such as vegetable market, fish market and other types of markets.

The width of a road is very much different from that of a street. A road is at least four times wider than a street. The larger width of the roads would facilitate the swift movement of traffic. You would find more trees on both sides of a road than in a street. This is because a street is occupied primarily by houses.
It took only a decade for China to build the world’s largest battery-powered electric vehicle market. Now the architect behind it, Wan Gang, wants to do the same for hydrogen-powered electric vehicles.

“The fuel cell is the future development direction,” said Wan Gang on Wednesday (April 17) on the sidelines of the Shanghai Auto Show.

Wan’s words carry great weight in China’s auto industry because of the role he played starting two decades ago in convincing China to take the steps—including lavish subsidies for manufacturers and buyers—that turned it into the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles.

Wan came back to China in 2000 from Germany, where he worked at Audi, at the invitation of the Chinese government. His idea of “leapfrogging (link in Chinese)” in the auto industry—going from internal combustion engines to “new-energy vehicles”—impressed the State Council, China’s cabinet. In 2007, only seven years later, the auto engineer was the first non-Chinese Communist Party member to be appointed science and technology minister. He retired last year (link in Chinese) from the position and now chairs a key association for China’s science professionals.

It’s no secret that the 66-year-old began his return to China by studying and researching the fuel cell industry himself—he developed three FCVs under a series called Chao Yue (meaning “to surpass”) during his time from 2003 and 2005 (link in Chinese) as chief scientist for China’s 863 Program. That was a national plan launched in March 1986 to help China catch up with the West in advanced technology. But, possibly due to the challenges of promoting fuel-cell technology in the early 2000s, China instead focused on advancing the manufacture of hybrid and pure battery vehicles.

Unlike battery-powered EVs, which can be charged in any place with a steady source of electricity, fuel-cell EVs need hydrogen. That creates a chicken-or-egg situation, where car owners don’t want to buy FCVs and companies don’t build hydrogen fuel stations because there aren’t enough FCVs on the road.

In recent months, though, Wan has frequently and publicly come back to the idea of fuel-cell technology. In December, he wrote an editorial about developing FCVs in public transport (link in Chinese) in China’s state-owned newspaper People’s Daily.

FCVs are zero-emissions, have long ranges, and require a short time to refuel. “It’s the best option for market demands,” said Wan in a speech (link in Chinese) on Wednesday to an audience of global car executives and Chinese officials that is one of the most-watched events at the auto show. Hundreds of people listened, snapping photos of his slides on technologies and trends in China’s EV industry.

In January, a report from local financial news media Securities Times said that China will promote FCVs using a similar blueprint to the one the country adopted a decade ago for EVs. China has announced that subsidies for FCVs will remain unchanged at least until 2020, even as China is cutting subsidies for EV makers by nearly half this year compared with last year so market forces can weed out the weakest firms.

According to Wan, it makes sense to promote FCVs starting in certain cities first. “The trend of fuel cells is to promote it step by step, it might start with certain areas first because fuel-cell development requires producing, storing, transporting, and fueling hydrogen, and operating this will develop in certain regions and [expand] like a net,” Wan said in the speech, citing a number that China had sold almost 2,000 FCVs by the end of 2018, and has around 15 fueling stations.

An Audi engineer for a decade in the 1990s, Wan rode an Audi A6L on his way out of the venue at noon after his morning speech. He returned in the afternoon for a roundtable discussion with executives from global carmakers like Ford, Tesla, and Honda, where he elaborated more on scenarios for using FCVs.

Quartz Wan Gang, left, at a roundtable discussion with global auto executives on April 17.

Already, some are trying to be at the forefront of the trend, which Wan says could see demand from long-distance buses and high-end cars, including for ride-hailing.

Zu Sijie, a deputy general engineer for SAIC Motor, China’s largest carmaker, said at the roundtable discussion that the group is China’s only carmaker that has FCV models for both passenger car and commercial vehicles ready to be scaled for mass production. China’s oldest carmaker, First Automobile Works (FAW) Group, has also announced plans to mass-produce fuel-cell versions of the Hongqi, a car with a long association with Communist Party elite.

Americanos produzem munições com carne de porco para impedir muçulmanos de irem para o paraíso A iniciativa é um protesto contra a ideia de criar um centro de cultura islâmico próximo ao Ground Zero em NY Americanos produzem munições com carne de porco para impedir muçulmanos de irem para o paraíso

A South Fork Industries, sediada no Estado americano de Idaho, produziu uma munição específica para matar mulçumanos. A empresa alega que essa é uma “forma de se defender daqueles que comentem atos violentos em nome do islamismo”.

Segundo o jornal Huffington Post, esta é uma iniciativa de um grupo de entusiastas por armas que se irritaram com a ideia de criar um centro de cultura islâmica próximo ao Ground Zero em Nova York, onde estavam localizadas as Torres Gêmeas.

As munições, chamadas Jihawg Ammo, foram revestidas com carne de porco e fundidas com a imagem do animal para tornar os projéteis “impuros” e impedir que os mulçumanos atingidos entrem no paraíso. Uma vez que a cultura islâmica considera pecado comer carne de porco.

De acordo com o jornal americano, no site da companhia as munições são anunciadas como “paz por meio dos porcos”. Também há anúncios como “coloque um pouco de pecado de Mohamed”.

A empresa responsável pela fabricação das munições não quis se pronunciar sobre os assuntos.

“He was fast straight away,” said Mills of Leigh’s test runs. “He wasn’t too different to my other two drivers [Neil Maclennan and Michael Macpherson] really. His lap times were fairly similar. He’ll go well.

“I don’t know about his racecraft and being used to having 20 other cars all around him but certainly speed-wise, he’s compared quite well with my other two [drivers].

Leigh already has some real-life racing experience having competed for a place in the Race of Champions over the past two years, most recently narrowly losing out to fellow sim racer James Baldwin.

Despite his high profile in sim racing, Mills didn’t realise he was dealing with an Esports champion when giving him his first test.

“He just asked to come and do a test two months ago. I didn’t even know who he was – my son knew who he was, I didn’t know!” Mills said.

“He tested and he went quite well. I thought it would just be a one-off but then he came back and did two more days and he was very good again.”

Leigh is the second driver in as many years to switch from online racing to FF1600. Sebastian Job won a drive with B-M Racing last season through the JMR Scholarship.

Job, who is now a Red Bull Racing Esports driver alongside former Scottish FF1600 champion and Walter Hayes Trophy winner Graham Carroll, scored a best result of fifth place at Kirkistown in the National championship last year.
Half of England is owned by less than 1% of the population

Half of England is owned by less than 1% of its population, according to new data shared with the Guardian that seeks to penetrate the secrecy that has traditionally surrounded land ownership.

The findings, described as “astonishingly unequal”, suggest that about 25,000 landowners – typically members of the aristocracy and corporations – have control of half of the country.

So 1% of the people own half of England. Inheritance tax reform could fix that | Peter Hetherington Read more

The figures show that if the land were distributed evenly across England’s population, each person would have just over half an acre – an area roughly half the size of Parliament Square in central London.

Major owners include the Duke of Buccleuch, the Queen, several large grouse moor estates, and the entrepreneur James Dyson.

While land has long been concentrated in the hands of a small number of owners, precise information about property ownership has been notoriously hard to access. But a combination of the development of digital maps and data as well as pressure from campaigners has made it possible to assemble the shocking statistics.

Jon Trickett, Labour MP and shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, hailed the significance of the findings and called for a full debate on the issue, adding: “The dramatic concentration of land ownership is an inescapable reminder that ours is a country for the few and not the many.

“It’s simply not right that aristocrats, whose families have owned the same areas of land for centuries, and large corporations exercise more influence over local neighbourhoods – in both urban and rural areas – than the people who live there.

“Land is a source of wealth, it impacts on house prices, it is a source of food and it can provide enjoyment for millions of people.”

Guy Shrubsole, author of the book in which the figures are revealed, Who Owns England?, argues that the findings show a picture that has not changed for centuries. “Most people remain unaware of quite how much land is owned by so few,” he writes, adding: “A few thousand dukes, baronets and country squires own far more land than all of middle England put together.”

“Land ownership in England is astonishingly unequal, heavily concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite.”

The book’s findings are drawn from a combination of public maps, data released through the Freedom of Information Act and other sources.

Shrubsole estimates that “the aristocracy and gentry still own around 30% of England”. This may even be an underestimate, as the owners of 17% of England and Wales remain undeclared at the Land Registry. The most likely owners of this undeclared land are aristocrats, as many of their estates have remained in their families for centuries.

As these estates have not been sold on the open market, their ownership does not need to be recorded at the Land Registry, the public body responsible for keeping a database of land and property in England and Wales.

Shrubsole estimates that 18% of England is owned by corporations, some of them based overseas or in offshore jurisdictions. He has based this calculation on a spreadsheet of land owned by all UK-registered companies that has been released by the Land Registry. From this spreadsheet, he has listed the top 100 landowning companies.

The list is headed by a large water company, United Utilities, which said that much of its land consisted of areas immediately surrounding its reservoirs.

Prominent on the list are the Boughton estate in Northamptonshire, belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch, the Woburn estate, which is owned by the Duke of Bedford, and the Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, owned by the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort. Several large grouse moor estates and Beeswax Dyson Farming, a farm owned by pro-Brexit businessman James Dyson, are also high on the list.

Shrubsole, who works as a campaigner for the environmental charity Friends of the Earth, estimates that “a handful of newly moneyed industrialists, oligarchs and City bankers” own around 17% of England.

The public sector – central and local government, and universities – appears to be the most open about its landholdings, according to Shrubsole, partly in order to advertise land it has wanted to sell off in recent years. He concludes that the public sector owns 8% of England.

Shrubsole writes that the bulk of the population owns very little land or none at all. Those who own homes in England, in total, own only 5% of the country.

He calculates that the land under the ownership of the royal family amounts to 1.4% of England. This includes the Crown Estate, the Queen’s personal estate at Sandringham, Norfolk, and the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, which provide income to members of the family.

Conservation charities, such as the National Trust and the Woodland Trust, collectively own 2% of England, while the church accounts for 0.5%.

Report calls for reform of 'unhealthy' land ownership in Scotland Read more

A small number of ultra-wealthy individuals have traditionally owned vast swaths of land in Scotland. Last month, a major review conducted by the Scottish Land Commission, a government quango, found that big landowners behaved like monopolies across large areas of rural Scotland and had too much power over land use, economic investment and local communities. The quango recommended radical reform of ownership rules.

Carys Roberts, chief economist of the left-of-centre thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research, said she was “shocked but not surprised” by Shrubsole’s findings on the concentration of land ownership. She said that the concentration of land in a few hands was a big reason why wealth as a whole was so unequal in the country, as those without land were prevented from generating more income.

She added: “We have this idea that the class structures have changed so that the aristocracy is not as important as it used to be. What this demonstrates is the continuing importance of the aristocracy in terms of wealth and power in our society.”

She said one effect of the sale of public land was that the public lost democratic control of that land and it could not then be used, for example, for housing or environmental improvements. “You can’t make the best social use of it,” she added.

• This article was amended on 18 April 2019. In calculating how much land there would be for each person in England if it were divided equally, an earlier version incorrectly used the population of the UK instead of England.
Trump and Republicans are using Omar to drive a wedge within the Democratic party and ‘foment hatred of Muslim Americans’

When Ilhan Omar became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in November, the American Muslim community saw her victory as a symbolic rejoinder to Donald Trump.

Omar’s remarkable journey – from a Somali refugee camp to the Minnesota state legislature and the hallways of the US Capitol – stood out among a historically diverse class of freshman lawmakers. The sight of Omar’s hijab on the House floor, made possible only by a rules change that for the first time in 181 years allowed religious headwear inside the chamber, reinforced the immediacy of her impact.

Four months since taking office, the landscape has dramatically changed.

While weathering numerous controversies, Omar has faced hundreds of death threats and emerged as a “perfect foil” for Trump and Republicans. All the while, Democrats have largely been split on whether to defend the embattled congresswoman and to what degree.

For Muslim advocates across the country, the attacks against Omar are inextricably linked to her faith – and part of a mounting effort by the president and his allies to stoke fears anew ahead of the 2020 election.

“Because of her identity as a black, Muslim woman, she is the poster child for the administration to attack,” said Hoda Hawa, the director of policy and advocacy at the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC).

“This administration, and particularly this president, is using her to not only drive a wedge within the Democratic party, but [for] something more sinister: He’s using her to continue to foment fear and hatred against the Muslim American community.”

‘A very calculated ploy’

Trump on Friday joined Republicans in attacking Omar over comments they argue downplayed the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001.

The president shared a video to his nearly 60 million Twitter followers that spliced together footage of the destruction on 9/11 with Omar’s remarks at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) last month.

“WE WILL NEVER FORGET,” Trump wrote.

Characterizing the genesis of the organization at the event, Omar said: “Cair was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” (Cair was, in fact, established in 1994. Omar’s spokesperson said the congresswoman misspoke.)

Conservatives seized on Omar’s remark that “some people did something” on 9/11 to accuse her of downplaying the terror attacks.

“You have to wonder if she’s an American first,” the Fox News host Brian Kilmeade said on Fox & Friends.

Matt Shuham (@mattshuham) Brian Kilmeade says of Rep. Ilhan Omar, "You have to wonder if she is an American first."



Then says, "In the name of religion, they kill Americans and still do it on a daily basis." pic.twitter.com/IpUDL7u7Xt

Republicans piled on and renewed calls for Omar to either resign or be dismissed from her position on the House foreign affairs committee. The Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post ran a front page featuring Omar’s words atop an image of the World Trade Center towers engulfed in flames on 9/11 with the retort: “Here’s your something.” Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, tweeted: “When Ilhan Omar isn’t being antisemitic, she’s sympathizing with Islamic terrorists.”

Trump’s own history of vilifying the Muslim community – and seeking to exploit the emotions of 9/11 – is well documented.

As a candidate, Trump falsely claimed that Muslims celebrated on the roofs of New Jersey as the World Trade Center towers fell. He campaigned on banning all Muslims from entering the US, flirted with the idea of a possible Muslim registry and once declared: “Islam hates us.”

That Omar has emerged as a target of Trump’s has come as little surprise to Muslim groups and anti-discrimination activists, who believe the president and his party are seeking to animate their supporters and drive a wedge through the Democratic party.

“Because Ilhan is Muslim and hijab-wearing, she became an immediate target,” said James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab American Institute.

“It’s a very calculated ploy to use her both to energize their base and to put Democrats in a quandary about, do they support her or do they shun her.”

Asha Noor, a racial justice and human rights activist with Cair Michigan, said there were countless examples of politicians or lawmakers needing to be “more careful with the way that they frame their messages and talking points”.

“The relationship that the president has with the Muslim community is very apparent with certain policies that he’s pushed,” Noor said, citing Trump’s travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.

Omar’s identity as a black Muslim woman, she said, “contributes to the level of hostility that she’s facing”.

“Even before that, his campaign set a tone of Islamophobia and xenophobic commentary,” Noor said.

“The incitement of violence against Ilhan has just been an escalation of that and further reflective of his attitudes and bias.”

‘This is the test for all of us’

Democrats have privately grown frustrated with the relentless focus on Omar, who in recent months sparked controversy for separate remarks on Israel that were criticized for perpetuating Jewish stereotypes.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved a resolution last month condemning both antisemitism and anti-Muslim speech in what was primarily seen as a rebuke of Omar’s conduct.

Several prominent Democrats, including most 2020 presidential contenders, have denounced Trump’s attacks on Omar and framed the moment a pivotal challenge for their own party as they campaign on a platform of inclusivity and tolerance.

“This is the test of all tests for us,” said Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman and 2020 candidate, while adding of Trump: “It’s not just that he is partisan, it’s not just that he is divisive. He is hateful. He is racist.”

“He’s trying to incite hatred, Islamophobia and, I would argue, violence against her and other Muslims in this country … He has encouraged the worst tendencies amongst our fellow Americans.”

Progressives have nonetheless taken issue with the reticent among Democratic leaders to more forcefully defend Omar.

In her initial statement on the subject, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, condemned Trump’s actions but made no mention of Omar. When directly confronted with Trump’s tweet, the Democratic national committee chairman, Tom Perez, said the president was trying to “distract” from more serious policy issues.

And some of Omar’s colleagues have complained that Democratic leadership has fallen short in its efforts to defend her.

“They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,” Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only other Muslim woman in Congress, tweeted on Saturday. “However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored.

“To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.”

Ulrich Szepat steht als Kandidat für die Stadtratswahl am 26. Mai 2019 in Wernigerode auf der AfD-Liste und wurde vom AG Zossen und vom LG Potsdam wegen Sieg-Heil-Rufen zu einer Geldstrafe von 60 Tagessätzen zu 30 Euro verurteilt. Symbolfoto: Marc Müller/dpa

Ulrich Szepat ist AfD-Kandidat für den Stadtrat Wernigerode. Ein "Sieg heil"-Ruf im Jahr 2017 hatte für ihn juristische Konsequenzen.

Wernigerode l Der in Wernigerode lebende Architekt Ulrich Szepat will in die Kommunalpolitik. Oder genauer formuliert: Er kandidiert bei der Wahl zum Stadtrat am 26. Mai als Parteiloser mit AfD-Aufnahmeantrag auf der AfD-Liste. Wird er gewählt, nähme ein Politiker mit fragwürdiger und strafrechtlich relevanter Vergangenheit im Stadtparlament Platz: Szepat ist Ende 2017 wegen des Verwendens von Kennzeichen verfassungsfeindlicher Organisationen vom Landgericht Potsdam zu einer Geldstrafe verurteilt worden.

Im Land Brandenburg war der heute 57-Jährige viele Jahre für die AfD politisch aktiv. Der Fall, der Szepat zumindest aktuell einen Eintrag im Bundeszentralregister beschert hat, reicht zurück bis Ende Januar 2017. Damals bestimmte die AfD in Rangsdorf (Kreis Teltow-Fläming) ihre Landesliste für die Bundestagswahl. Am Abend, so Ulrich Szepat zur Volksstimme, sei es zu einem feucht-fröhlichen Finale an der Hotelbar gekommen. AfD-Vertreter hätten die erste Strophe des Deutschlandliedes – „Deutschland, Deutschland über alles ...“ – gegrölt.

Reaktion

„Da habe ich mich unwohl gefühlt“, erinnert sich Szepat heute zurück. Auch an seine Reaktion seinerzeit: Er habe „Sieg heil“ gerufen. Was mindestens höchst merkwürdig anmutet, begründet der 57-Jährige heute so: „Ich wollte denen mit den Worten ,Sieg heil‘ den Spiegel vorhalten.“ Doch warum ist er nicht anderweitig aktiv geworden, um das ihm unangenehme Verhalten seiner Parteifreunde zu unterbinden? Für ihn sei seine Reaktion eine treffende Form des Protests gewesen, sagt er.

Eine, die für ihn juristische Konsequenzen hatte. Obwohl die AfD-Spitze in Brandenburg wohl bemüht war, den Vorfall unter den Teppich zu kehren, wurde er publik und auch Gegenstand einer Strafanzeige, wie sich Szepat erinnert. Die erste Quittung kassierte er im Oktober 2017 vor dem Amtsgericht Zossen. Besagtes Verwenden von Kennzeichen verfassungsfeindlicher Organisationen bestrafte das Amtsgericht nach Angaben von Gerichtssprecher Wolfgang Böhm mit einer Geldstrafe in Höhe von 60 Tagessätzen zu je 30 Euro.

Straftat

Jene 1800 Euro Strafe habe er nicht zahlen wollen, so Szepat. Er ging vor dem Landgericht Potsdam in Berufung. Schon im November 2017 kam es dort zur zweiten Runde der juristischen Aufarbeitung. Und dabei, so Szepat, habe ihm der Richter klargemacht, dass er – ungeachtet aller Beweggründe – mit „Sieg heil“ eine Straftat begangen habe, die entsprechend geahndet werde. Konsequenz für den Angeklagten: Szepat zog seine Berufung zurück und akzeptierte die 1800 Euro Geldstrafe. Das hat eine Sprecherin des Landgerichts Potsdam auf Anfrage bestätigt.

Der 57-Jährige, der 2018 aus „familiären Gründen“ nach Wernigerode kam und hier als Architekt und Baugutachter tätig ist, gilt damit juristisch gesehen als vorbestraft. Zumindest hat er nach Angaben des Zossener Gerichtssprechers Böhm seit Mitte 2018 einen entsprechenden Eintrag im Bundeszentralregister. Weil allerdings Geldstrafen mit weniger als 90 Tagessätzen nicht ins allgemeine Führungszeugnis aufgenommen werden – wenn es dort keine weiteren Eintragungen gibt –, kann sich Szepat nach außen hin als nicht vorbestraft einstufen.
Why it matters: It’s no secret that tech companies with competing products aren’t averse to using dirty tricks to get ahead. According to a former Mozilla executive, it’s something Google has been doing for years: intentionally sabotaging Firefox to increase Chrome’s popularity.

Jonathan Nightingale, former General Manager and Vice President of the Firefox group at Mozilla, revealed all on Twitter over the weekend. He writes that Google was the company’s biggest partner during his eight years at Mozilla. “Our revenue share deal on search drove 90% of Mozilla’s income,” he tweeted. But Nightingale claims Google used underhand tactics to ensure Chrome stayed ahead of its rival.

When chrome launched things got complicated, but not in the way you might expect. They had a competing product now, but they didn’t cut ties, break our search deal - nothing like that. In fact, the story we kept hearing was, “We’re on the same side. We want the same things.” — Johnathan Nightingale (@johnath) April 13, 2019

Nightingale says that while Google’s individual workers believed both companies were on the same side, the organization itself didn't see things that way.

"Google Chrome ads started appearing next to Firefox search terms. Gmail & [Google] Docs started to experience selective performance issues and bugs on Firefox. Demo sites would falsely block Firefox as 'incompatible'," he said.

"All of this is stuff you're allowed to do to compete, of course. But we were still a search partner, so we'd say 'hey what gives?' And every time, they'd say, 'oops. That was accidental. We'll fix it in the next push in 2 weeks.'”

These so-called accidents happened hundreds of times, and Nightingale doesn’t believe Google is so incompetent as to keep making mistakes. Each time one of these issues arose, Firefox lost users to Chrome.

I think they were running out the clock. We lost users during every oops. And we spent effort and frustration every clock tick on that instead of improving our product. We got outfoxed for a while and by the time we started calling it what it was, a lot of damage had been done. — Johnathan Nightingale (@johnath) April 13, 2019

This isn’t the first time such accusations have appeared. Last year, Mozilla Program Manager Chris Peterson tweeted that Google had intentionally slowed down the YouTube loading performance of Firefox and Edge. The site had previously loaded faster than Chrome on these browser, but Google “switched to using a JavaScript library for YouTube that they knew wasn’t supported by Firefox,” writes ZDNet.

YouTube page load is 5x slower in Firefox and Edge than in Chrome because YouTube's Polymer redesign relies on the deprecated Shadow DOM v0 API only implemented in Chrome. You can restore YouTube's faster pre-Polymer design with this Firefox extension: https://t.co/F5uEn3iMLR — Chris Peterson (@cpeterso) July 24, 2018

According to NetMarketShare, Chrome holds almost 68 percent of the browser market while Firefox has just over 9 percent.
From this month onwards, a portion of Income Tax paid by Welsh taxpayers will stay in Wales to directly fund public services.

The First Minister, Mark Drakeford has previously indicated that he would not increase Welsh Income Tax rates during the current assembly term unless he was “compelled to do so”. Jeremy Miles used his speech at the Labour conference to call on the party to campaign “unashamedly” use these new tax varying powers during the next assembly term in yet another sign that the 2021 election will be fought on competing tax policies. So, what are the policy options?

Devolved Income Tax raises £2 billion pounds in revenue for the Welsh Treasury so any changes to Income Tax rates would have a sizeable impact on the Welsh budget. For instance, putting 1p on the Basic Rate would generate £182 million in additional revenue.

Given the funding pressures faced by Welsh local authorities and Wales’ aging demographic profile, social care may well be first in line for additional funds. This could prove to be a more progressive alternative to further steep increases in Council Tax, particularly because the increase in the Personal Allowance means that the lowest 20% of Welsh earners are not liable to pay any Income Tax.

Of course, tax rises are not the only policy option. Since the Welsh tax base is heavily skewed towards Basic Rate payers, cutting the Additional Rate by 5p would have a relatively marginal effect on the size of the Welsh budget (£26.5 million). Policy-makers might hope that cutting the tax rate for the highest-earners would make Wales more attractive for investors and encourage more Additional Rate payers to move here, strengthening the tax base in the process. Putting aside the question of whether such a policy would be popular with the electorate, predicting behavioural response to tax policy is an inexact science.

While cutting the Basic Rate of Income Tax would likely have broader support, doing so would come at a considerable cost to the Welsh Treasury — £182 million for each 1p cut, assuming no behavioural response.

Subject to the UK government’s agreement, the Welsh Government also has powers to propose new taxes in devolved areas. The Welsh Government has previously mooted four new taxes including a Social Care Levy, Tourism Tax, Vacant Land Tax and Disposable Plastics tax. The First Minister has since announced that the government will be introducing a Vacant Land Tax to encourage development of empty plots. Although this tax is unlikely to be a big revenue-raiser, it will allow the Welsh Government to test the waters with their new tax powers.

The devolution of Income Tax is likely to have a broader impact on future Welsh government policies by issuing new incentives to increase the size of the tax base and encourage faster earnings growth.

According to current forecasts, Wales is projected to be around £9 million a year better off as a result of tax devolution. Forecasted revenues were revised upwards in March due to stronger than expected self-assessment receipts for January.

On the employment front, the latest data for Wales is promising. Historically, there has been a persistent gap between the employment rate for working-age adults in Wales and England. However, the latest data from the Labour Force Survey suggests that this gap has since closed. Whether this convergence is sustained will play a key role in determining whether Wales is better off as a result of tax devolution.

The most recent data on Welsh earnings is less positive. In 2017-18, the annual percentage growth in pay in Wales was 0.8%, 2.1 percentage points below the increase in UK earnings. Based on a three-year rolling average, wages are now growing relatively slower in Wales than the UK as whole. The relatively slower wage growth can be attributed to relatively larger pay increases for earners within the highest earning decile in the UK.

In 2019-20, the highest-earning decile of taxpayers (in terms of non-savings and non-dividend incomes) will contribute around 38% of Welsh Income Tax, more than the lowest-earning seven deciles. The highest-earning 1% of taxpayers alone will contribute over a tenth of devolved tax revenues.

Income tax devolution represents an important step-change in the history of devolution. Even with no major changes to tax policy, trends in the workforce and earnings are already influencing the funds available to the Welsh Government. Over the next 24 months, expect to see the political parties honing their positions on devolved taxes. Faced with pressure to differentiate themselves from other parties in the race, the next Welsh Assembly elections may well be fought on competing tax policies.

CLOSE The U.S. Department of Agriculture is getting sued for alleged fecal contamination in the production of chicken and other meats. USA TODAY

A nonprofit advocacy group has sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleging the agency has not appropriately responded to their concerns about fecal contamination in the production of chicken and other meats.

The lawsuit was filed by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The group says it has 12,000 members who are doctors; it advocates for "plant-based diets and ethical and effective scientific research."

The group has previously petitioned the USDA to change how it regulates fecal contamination in meat and poultry production, the lawsuit says.

That effort followed a 2011 study by the nonprofit which allegedly found fecal bacteria in 48% of analyzed poultry products sourced from 10 U.S. cities.

"Although USDA implements a 'zero tolerance' policy for fecal contamination, this policy applies to visible fecal contamination only," the lawsuit alleges "The result is that fecally contaminated meat and chicken products pass inspection as long as the feces on them are not visible to the naked eye."

Since the group petitioned the USDA in 2013, the situation has worsened, the lawsuit alleges, citing increased privatization of the inspection process.

April 17: Chewy Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies recalled

April 16: Ben & Jerry’s recalls some Chunky Monkey, Coconut Seven Layer Bar flavors for unlisted tree nuts

The lawsuit seeks a "substantive response" to that original petition. It also claims the agency has not adequately responded to a 2017 Freedom of Information Act request regarding fecal contamination rates and other data relating to poultry production.

The USDA responded Tuesday to the lawsuit by saying it "disagrees with the underlying assumption that meat and poultry products bearing the mark of inspection are likely to be contaminated with feces," the Washington Post reports.

The agency's response says pathogen testing is used to prevent fecal contamination, the newspaper reports. Proper cooking of meat also destroys pathogens, the agency said.

Previously published material from the North American Meat Institute says bacteria found on meat products is not the same as "fecal contamination."

"All raw agricultural products, whether bananas, beef or broccoli, contain bacteria," the industry group says.

Publications from The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and the North American Meat Institute show the groups differ on how the presence of E. coli in meat should be presented to the public.

Noting that only specific strains of E. coli are known to make people sick, the Meat Institute says: "E. coli is not considered an 'adulterant.' If it were an adulterant in food, most fresh food would need to be recalled."

The publication goes on to note, "A swab of phones and keyboards would likely find E. coli, but that doesn’t mean there is ‘poop’ on your phone."

In contrast, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has used the presence of E. coli as an indicator of fecal contamination, citing "USDA and industry testing."

The group has conducted pointed campaigns on the topic of fecal contamination in past years. In 2012, the group suggested chicken should be marked with a warning sticker saying “May Contain Feces.”

State Politics The curious circumstances that led to the SunPass debacle were years in the making





Seven years ago, Florida lawmakers gave the state transportation department a mission: hire a company to take over tolls and customer service calls for the four turnpike authorities.





For one lucky company, the reward was an estimated $600 million over 14 years.

But the company the state hired — Conduent State & Local Solutions — got too lucky, competitors alleged.

Records show state officials lowered the minimum requirements and deviated from their own policies to negotiate only with Conduent, even though they could have sought better deals with the company’s competitors.

Those competitors accused state officials of outright bias toward Conduent, whose lobbyist was close to then-Gov. Rick Scott. And the companies felt they had a strong case. They had submitted bids lower than Conduent’s offer by up to $47 million, and one had better technical scores.

When the companies protested, the state paid $3.6 million to get one to go away.

How and why Florida decided to hire Conduent is now the subject of an investigation by the state’s chief inspector general and questioning by lawmakers, who were barraged with angry calls last summer about SunPass. It botched the takeover of the tolling system by over-billing customers or missing their payments.

In a letter to state Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, last month, the Florida Department of Transportation’s new secretary said officials are committed to answering questions about the procurement “to the very best of our ability and in a fully transparent manner.”

But the department did not say why some decisions were made, or if taxpayers got the best possible deal.

The initial requirements

In 2012, when Florida transportation officials agreed to create a one-stop shop for the state’s tolling systems, they first set minimum requirements for companies that wanted to process tolls in the nation’s third most populous state.

Companies had to be able to process at least 1 billion toll transactions per year and manage 4.5 million accounts. That’s about the same number of transactions and accounts the state was already processing in a fragmented and outdated system across Florida.

But then, Florida officials lowered those minimum requirements — twice.

The new standard: Companies had to handle just 500 million transactions and 2.25 million accounts.

The decision came at the urging of a contractor with the engineering firm HNTB hired by the state to help with the bidding process. The reason given was that initial requirements were keeping “a number of companies” from applying for the job, officials said.

When asked about the new standard, a transportation department spokeswoman couldn’t say why it was changed, referring instead to testimony from the contractor helping with the bid process.

In a 2015 deposition, the HNTB contractor, Tim Garrett, said the standard was lowered after several companies lost interest in the project. But he didn’t know why they lost interest, or whether Conduent had complained about the high standards.

State transportation officials won’t say which companies were excluded. But according to depositions and court filings, executives at two companies suspected one company in particular: Conduent.

A behemoth in America’s tolling industry, Conduent, then known as Xerox, was managing tolling operations in several states.

And it had powerful connections. Records show that in 2012, the same year that lawmakers asked for the SunPass contract, Conduent hired powerful Tallahassee lobbyist Brian Ballard, a Scott supporter and host of the governor’s $3 million inauguration festivities.

Last year, it was disclosed that Scott and his wife had invested at least $5 million in a hedge fund that held shares of Conduent worth $127 million, though it’s unclear for how long they had that investment. In May, Scott attended a fundraiser for his successful U.S. Senate campaign in the Dallas home of Darwin Deason, a major Conduent shareholder.

In its SunPass application, Conduent cited its New Jersey and New York tolling jobs, which both had “in excess of 500 million” transactions per year — a vague number barely above the new lowered minimum.

Two other companies — Cubic, based in San Diego, and Accenture, based in Ireland — did not have tolling systems in America. But Cubic cited its experience in a similar field, processing transactions for New York’s MetroCard system. Accenture touted its experience handling more than 12 billion transactions each year for Deutsche Bank.

Conduent’s limited capacity for transactions led to some of the problems Floridians experienced when Conduent took over tolls last year, according to Gerry O’Reilly, a state department of transportation district secretary.

“The system was completely overwhelmed,” O’Reilly said. “There just wasn’t enough horsepower there to process it all.”

Choosing Conduent

Deciding which company would handle the SunPass job was left to the leaders of the four turnpike authorities. The process was led by the head of the Florida Turnpike Enterprise, Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti, who had overseen the New Jersey Turnpike Authority before coming south.

As head of the Turnpike Enterprise, Gutierrez-Scaccetti reported to Ananth Prasad, who was then the secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation. Prasad reported to Scott.

Accenture clearly won the technical rankings, which evaluate things like price, the experience of the company and team members. Of the eight people on the state’s technical review panel, four ranked Accenture first. Conduent came in second, with two first-place votes, and Cubic was third, also with two first-place votes but with fewer second-place votes.

When it came to price, Cubic and Accenture ranked first and second, in that order. Cubic was cheaper than Conduent by $47 million.

Those results were given to Gutierrez-Scaccetti and the three leaders of the expressway authorities.

What they did next led to more than a year of litigation.

Under Florida law, transportation officials were required to pick the companies they wanted to negotiate with and then determine which one provided the “best value.”

Under state transportation department rules, they were required to negotiate with the three companies that made the final list.

Instead, Gutierrez-Scaccetti and the heads of the Orlando and Tampa expressway authorities chose to negotiate only with Conduent. If those negotiations failed, they would then negotiate with another company.

Gutierrez-Scaccetti said she wanted Conduent because it had done tolls and she believed it was the safest choice.

“I’m a bit risk averse,” she said, according to a transcript of a 2014 meeting.

Joe Waggoner, the head of the Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority, and Laura Kelley, the then-interim director of Orlando’s expressway authority, agreed. (On Kelley’s recommendation, the Central Florida Expressway Authority board would later back out of the deal, citing uncertainty over the costs. State officials didn’t allow Kelley to participate in the negotiations with Conduent, records show.)

Executives for Accenture and Cubic filed protests, alleging transportation officials broke Florida law and their own procurement policies by choosing to negotiate only with Conduent.

They also pointed to potential conflicts of interest. The head of the state team negotiating with Conduent was a former Conduent employee. Members of the state’s consulting team were previously employed by a major Conduent subcontractor.

The technical review team and selection committee “merely created an illusion of a competitive procurement, but the contract award decision was in fact solely placed in the hands of the Turnpike director,” a lawyer for Accenture wrote.

Cubic’s lawyer noted that Gutierrez-Scaccetti flew to New Jersey for an industry conference less than two weeks before the selection meeting. After the conference, she delayed her flight to meet with Conduent representatives and one of its subcontractors.

State employees involved in awarding contracts are prohibited from discussing the bidding with the competing companies before the selection is made, but in a 2014 deposition, Gutierrez-Scaccetti denied discussing the contract when she met with Conduent officials, asserting that she discussed developing a transponder unrelated to the SunPass project. Cubic’s lawyers claimed it appeared improper. Gutierrez-Scaccetti, who is now commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Transportation, did not respond to requests for comment.

Prasad declined to comment. A spokesman for Scott said the former governor was not responsible.

“Scott’s office was not involved in agency contracts, but he has been clear that if there was wrongdoing, action should be taken to hold people accountable,” said Chris Hartline.

The losers seek a legal option

Appeals from Cubic and Accenture stalled when an administrative law judge ruled against them, concluding that potential conflicts were harmless and that state officials were allowed to deviate from policy and conduct negotiations with only one company.

A department spokeswoman said Wednesday that bids can deviate from policy if the new process is spelled out in the bid process.

Cubic appealed the judge’s decision and a three-judge panel agreed enough with Cubic’s argument to stop the state’s negotiations with Conduent until the case could be heard in full. Negotiations would be delayed by months or a year.

That’s when then-Florida Department of Transportation Secretary Prasad met with Cubic’s executives and, in a highly unusual move, asked them to drop their case in exchange for a $3.6 million settlement.

Part of the stated rationale for the settlement was that state officials were buying intellectual property in Cubic’s bid, which sometimes happens when a losing bidder has a good idea.

But state officials can’t say now whether the idea was ever used.
Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Elijah Cummings and Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters executed a secret Memorandum of Understanding to “target” President Trump and subpoena all his financial and banking records, according to a letter sent to Cummings from ranking committee member Rep. Jim Jordan.

Further, Jordan’s letter indicates that other MOUs have apparently been signed and agreed to with House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca, who has promised to continue investigations into the president despite findings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Attorney General William Barr released a summary of Mueller’s 400 page report several weeks ago and the redacted version of the report is expected to be released by the DOJ this Thursday.







On Monday, Jordan sent a memorandum explaining his objections to the partisan behavior of Cummings and “unprecedented subpoena to Mazars USA LLP,” as reported by SaraACarter.com.

“We’d describe (the MOUs) as an agreement to conspire and coordinate their efforts to attack and investigate POTUS,” Congressional official.

“We’d describe (the MOUs) as an agreement to conspire and coordinate their efforts to attack and investigate POTUS,” said a congressional official with knowledge of the MOUs. “This is not how committee’s normally operate. Dems aren’t interested in legislating. Only attacking POTUS.”

Jordan emphatically objected to the secret MOUs and excoriated Democrats who “did not consult with Republican Members of the Committee or allow Members to consider and debate the terms of your MOU before executing the MOU with Chairwoman Waters. You did not disclose the MOU’s existence to Members or the American people until after I raised the matter.”

In the letter Jordan asks Cummings to “provide greater transparency around your secretive conduct.”







Jordan also requested that Cummings answer specific questions about the MOUs.

“If you intend to continue to use the Committee’s limited resources to attack President Trump for political gain, I hope that you will at least be transparent about your actions,” said Jordan at the end of his letter. “Your ability to function as a fair and unbiased finder of fact is now at grave risk. The Members of the Committee—and, more importantly, the American citizens we represent—deserve to know exactly how you are leading this Committee. I look forward to your detailed answers to these questions.”

Questions for Cummings

How many MOUs with committee chairpersons have you signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress? Would you provide the Committee with a detailed list of the other MOUs you have signed, including their dates, signatories, and topics? Why did you not publicly disclose that you had signed MOUs with committee chairpersons? Will you publicly disclose all the MOUs you have signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress? Why did you choose not to consult with any Republican Members before signing these MOUs? Have you signed any MOUs as Chairman with any entities outside of the House Representatives relating to the Committee’s oversight or legislative work? To the extent your MOUs create duties for the Committee that conflict with the Rules of the House of Representatives or the Rules of the Committee, which duties prevail? The Rules of the Committee for the 116th Congress do not authorize the Chairman to bind the Committee through an MOU.[2]Could you explain the specific authority that allows you to bind the Committee through an MOU without first obtaining approval through a vote of the Committee? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have committed to sharing Committee information with the Financial Services Committee. This provision of your MOU may conflict with Rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee’s whistleblower protocol, which requires the Committee to keep some Committee information confidential. Will you still protect the confidentiality of whistleblower information notwithstanding your apparent obligation to share it with the Financial Services Committee? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have agreed to consult with her before issuing a subpoena. Do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after you consult with me, as required by Committee Rules? If I object to your proposed subpoena, do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after the Committee votes, as you promised in the Committee’s organizing meeting? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have declined to include any provision protecting the Minority’s rights to documentary or testimonial information. Can you guarantee that Minority Members will have the same access to documentary or testimonial information under this MOU as we do in every other Committee inquiry?

Gravitational echoes may be caused by the collision of two black holes, and may indicate that these objects have completely new physical properties. This conclusion was made by RUDN physicists after a series of mathematical calculations. The scientists state that if the existence of the echo phenomenon is confirmed, astrophysicists would have to reconsider their view of compact space objects. The results of the study were published in Physical Review D.

According to the theory of general relativity (GR), any massive object distorts space-time. A similar effect is observed when a heavy metal ball is placed on stretched elastic fabric. The heavier is the ball, the deeper is the depression in the fabric. Similarly, the higher the mass of an object, the more it distorts space-time. Black holes are among the heaviest objects in the universe, and therefore distort space-time the most. When two black holes collide, gravitational waves spread out from the site of collision. They can be compared to rings on the water, or sound waves, but there is one important peculiar feature. Gravitational waves do not propagate spatially—they are themselves the oscillations of space-time.

Gravitational waves from the collision of two black holes decay with time, but on their final stage, they can cause the so-called echo—additional wave scattering. It can be compared to regular acoustic echo. The existence of such gravitational echo has not been confirmed yet, and there are different opinions about its possible source. A RUDN physicist, together with colleagues from the Czech Republic and Russia, assumed that if the existence of gravitational echo is experimentally confirmed, it would be the beginning of the new physics adding to GR.

Hypothetically, black holes may be influenced by adjacent massive objects, such as galactic nuclei, accretion discs, or clouds of matter. Previously, it was believed that gravitational waves may scatter on these objects and form echo. The authors of the study provided a mathematical proof that such objects cause very weak echo or none at all.

According to the calculations, for a conglomeration of matter to cause echo, its mass should be at least comparable to the mass of the black hole itself. However, there are usually no such heavy objects around black holes. If they were found, gravitational waves from such black holes would look differently even on the initial collision stages.

The second possible explanation might be specific boundary conditions on the surface of a black hole. To understand them, astrophysicists will have to reconsider their views on black holes, and it cannot be done within the existing GR framework.

"We demonstrated that if the echo is registered after the final stage of collision, it would indicate not the existence of a certain massive object near a black hole, but a set of new physical laws describing the surfaces of compact objects," says Roman Konoplya, a co-author of the work, and a research associate of the Training and Science Institute of Gravitation and Cosmology at RUDN.

American Democrats are pining ever more loudly for socialism these days, for “free” education, “free” health care and much else.

Let me tell you about socialism as I lived it under the Fidel Castro regime.

The house where I was born in Communist Cuba had a dirt floor, a bathroom hole-in-the-ground, which we shared with six other families, and a zinc roof that left us unbearably hot in the summer and shivering in the winter.

We had no running water, no refrigerator and no door in the back of the house. We cooked with charcoal. My mother raised four boys by herself in that “house,” working 12 hours a day to earn 160 Cuban pesos, or approximately $6, a month.

Why didn’t we fix it? In addition to the meager income, we had no access to hardware stores to buy nails or cement to fix our humble house. In fact, the local member of the ­National Assembly was the only person authorized to approve whether we could buy a bag of cement or a roll of roof paper — if they were available.

We couldn’t buy these simple materials without that precious piece of paper. Can you imagine going to your congressional representative to ask for permission to buy a box of nails? Or roof tiles? Or roof paper? It seems unthinkable in the United States. But in Cuba, where we lacked the ­necessities of life, we had to. And when we complained, the authorities scolded us to be grateful for free education and free health care.

In Cuba, it is illegal to speak against the government or complain about living conditions. We were prohibited from speaking with local media, but the journalists were state employees and wouldn’t publish our stories anyway. We couldn’t ­express our unmet needs and were reminded that we shouldn’t complain anyway, ­because we were promised — you guessed it — free education and free health care.

In Cuba, doctors make the equivalent of 25 cents an hour and teachers 21 cents an hour. Pharmacists earn eight cents an hour.

In Cuba, there is no right to free speech and virtually no ­independent media.

There are no free, fair, multiparty elections. In fact, there is just one political party (Communist), and only members of the Communist Party may run as candidates for any ­office. But we were told we couldn’t object to this system, lest we lose our free education and free health care.

Two of my brothers were sent to fight in Angola when I was a boy. After years of risking their lives for a strange cause, they came back to Cuba to find out that their mother and little brother were living under worse conditions than before they left. They learned that the promise of going to another country to fight for the “big, beautiful future of socialism” was just a big lie.

In Cuba, if you dare to yell something true — like “Fidel and Raul are dictators!” — you could spend many years in prison. Dictatorship is another price we had to pay for free education and free health care.

I desperately needed something more than the promises of free education and free health care. I knew that I needed freedom — freedom to speak my mind and vote my conscience. It was worth the risk of being eaten by sharks than to continue living a life with no purpose and no freedom.

see also Trump administration to let Americans sue Cuban companies The Trump administration will let Americans file lawsuits in US...

On August 16, 1994, I decided to get into a boat with 20 other Cubans in search of a future.

One of my two brothers followed me to the United States, also in a raft, nearly dying of thirst and hunger during the journey. My other brother is still awaiting the visa I filed for him.

Throughout their ordeals, my brothers have been promised free education and free health care.

After arriving in the United States, I worked as an international sales manager, owned a restaurant, hosted a radio program and authored two books. Today, I work for a member of Congress. None of those opportunities would have been possible for me in socialist Cuba.

I wish that one day I might have a conversation with some of these young American socialists, who have no experience with actually existing socialism. They like to think they can have democracy and a socialist economy. But everywhere it’s been implemented, public ownership of the means of production has led to political repression.

Not least in my native Cuba, with its promises of “free” cradle-to-grave services.

I chose so much more than the promise of “free.” I chose freedom.

The Japanese government changed the restrictions on cryptocurrency.

The Japanese government decided on the 15th that it would like to amend the law, including the tightening of restrictions on cryptocurrency trading companies. The Japanese government explained the contents of the draft amendments.

As there was a huge amount of virtual currency hacking cases last year, we will change the law to secure user protection and clarify rules.

The main points of the revised proposal are as follows.

● Name change to "Cryptographic asset"

Change the name of virtual currency to "cryptographic assets" and keep pace with the international community including 20 countries and regions (G20) meetings.

In addition, the name of the exchange company is also "the cryptographic asset exchange company" in the law.

However, this is just a legal name change, for example, there is no force that requires each exchange vendor to name cryptographic assets.

From the members of the study group, it was originally expected as a currency, such as "Japan was ahead of the world by enacting the Revised Fund Settlement Act, but the situation has changed since the virtual currency rise in 2017." The voice of having moved away from things has been one after another, and the mood of renaming to cryptographic assets has increased.

Last month, Prime Minister Abe also stated that he would call the virtual currency a "cryptographic asset."

● Measures against virtual currency outflow risk

Given the fact that there were two massive virtual currency spill incidents in 2018, in order to deal with the risk of spills, “the same amount of repayment resources (same, same amount of It is mandatory to hold “cryptographic assets”.

It also legally requires "Cold Wallet", which manages assets offline with respect to the virtual currency deposited by customers.

The limit of virtual currency managed by Hot Wallet will be considered in the future.

● Leverage trading

Cryptographic currency leverage transactions are subject to the regulations of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, as with FX.

The upper limit of leverage in the pending leverage transaction will be determined separately by Cabinet Office Ordinance etc., and the specific multiple will be determined taking into account the volatility at that time.

The FSA said, "I don't think the leverage ratio will be large."

At the study group on cryptocurrency exchange business, some members said that the upper limit has been doubled in foreign countries such as the EU.



He emphasized the importance of responding flexibly while looking at volatility and the like.

According to JVCEA, the virtual currency transaction volume in FY17 was 69 trillion yen, 80% of which was occupied by margin money and credit transactions.

● ICO regulation

With regard to ICO (initial coin offering), which is fund raising using tokens, it is clarified that ICOs that can be regarded as investments and that can be regarded as investments are subject to financial instruments transaction regulations.

Also, in the same way as stocks, etc., we will establish a system for information disclosure to investors and regulations on sales and solicitation.

According to the nature of the ICO, the study group is concerned with the sale of investment products.

Financial regulation, sales of payment and settlement means

About what is recognized

It has been reported that it is appropriate to carry out the regulation on payment and the necessary response.

● Other regulations

In addition, the ban on misrepresentation and hype by the exchange traders and the fraudulent acts such as the spread of the reputation and the price manipulation were included.

In addition, in response to the appearance of “a cryptographic asset that has problems such as being easy to use for money laundering because the transfer record is not disclosed”, “change the cryptographic asset handled by the exchange company as a notification in advance, and check for any problems. Maintain the mechanism.

The FSA cited a virtual currency with weak governance, which is prone to anonymous currency and forks, as a representative of "problematic cryptographic assets."

For custody traders who manage the customer's virtual currency, apply the “Regulations on management of cryptographic assets among the restrictions on cryptographic asset exchange traders” such as identity verification and separation management duties.

Kommentar Brand in Paris

Notre-Dame lenkt ab

Die Betroffenheit über das Feuer in der Kathedrale steht in keinem Verhältnis zur Bedeutung. Weltbewegender für die Zukunft ist die Klimakrise.

Notre-Dame brennt. Die Bilder bewegen: Rot scheint die Glut auf den beiden Türmen wider, in ihrer Mitte skelettartig die Silhouette des Baugerüsts. Frankreich und Europa stehen unter Schock. Ein Glück, dass Präsident Emmanuel Macron einen Blick für das Wesentliche hat: Er ruft den nationalen Notstand aus. Europa beweist derweil in seiner Betroffenheit und im blitzartigen Geldgeben grenzübergreifende Freundschaft. Geeint stehen wir, denn Paris’ Herz brennt.

Der kollektive Schreck mag echt sein, und dennoch drängt sich der Eindruck auf, dass viele in diesen Tagen dankbar sind für eine Katastrophe, die sich lösen lässt. Denn: Zum ersten Mal seit Jahrzehnten sieht sich die Öffentlichkeit dank Fridays For Future mit der Klimakrise konfrontiert. Wie leicht sich nun die Mehrheit davon ablenken lässt, zeigt, wie wenig die Bewegung verstanden wurde. Darum an dieser Stelle noch einmal in aller Deutlichkeit: Die Erde brennt, nicht bloß eine Kirche.

Unsere Maßstäbe für die Beurteilung der Dringlichkeit eines Problems sollten wir deshalb grundlegend überdenken. Ein ungebremster Klimawandel bedroht unsere Lebensgrundlagen – im Gegensatz zum Feuer im Dach einer Pariser Kathedrale. Das sollte sich auch in der gesellschaftlichen Diskussion widerspiegeln. Es braucht eine konstruktive Debatte über neue Wege, um eine Gesellschaft aufbauen zu können, die Bestand hat.

Dieser Diskurs entsteht aber nicht. Stattdessen wird Fridays For Future lächerlich gemacht, indem sich absurde „For Futures“ gründen. Besonders bemerkenswert ist die Initiative „Reli­gions For Future“ – eine beeindruckend paradoxe Denkleistung, die hinter diesem Namen steckt. Etwas Antiquierteres als Religion und Kirche gibt es ja wohl nicht, weniger Innovationsgeist findet sich nur in den Wahlprogrammen der großen Parteien für die anstehende Europawahl.

Der Brand der Notre-Dame hat insofern Symbolcharakter – als junger Mensch darf man das ruhig ein bisschen zukunftsweisend finden.

It's 4 in the morning, and I feel like I have been crying for hours.

My baby will not feed. It's killing me. He is hungry and angry, and I think that's my fault because I am upset and it's making him upset.

Earlier in the day my mother in law did something that made me so angry, that I haven't been able to stop crying.

I am nursing in the living room while talking to MIL. We are 20 minutes deep into talking about a TV show when she moves from her spot across from me, lifts up the blanket I am using to cover me and my LO, PHYSICALLY pulls my breast out of LO mouth, and scoops him up in what seemed like one swift motion.

I was shocked. It happened in less then 2 seconds. I immediately said, what the fuck are you doing?! To which she said, what? Grandma needs her baby time too.

I am not proud of saying I kinda just sat in silence for a minute, I genuinely thought I got something wrong. I then told her it was not ok to take my baby or touch my boobs. All I go was, oh honey you lost the right to your boobs when you decided to breastfeed. You can't get upset, one day I'll have tits bigger than yours. In any case, I only get to see him once a day.

I just started crying. I left to go cry in the kitchen where she couldn't see me, but I could keep an eye out on LO.

When DH came home, she accused me of being homophobic because how dare I acuse her of being pervy.

I tried posting twice on JustNoMIL, but my posts we're removed because I gave the backstory of how my MIL is trans. What sucks is that it really is important to how I feel, but some people got really butt hurt about it. I am accepting of her, but it's so uncomfortable having someone who has a beard, dresses like a man, dates women, touch my breasts and want to talk about my body all the time. She was obsessed with my pregnancy, and would not keep her hands to herself. People thought she was my husband, it sucked.

I am a jumbled mess of feeling. Thank you for listening
On Wednesday night, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson discussed the implosion of former Congressman Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign and the failure of any of the leading Democratic Party presidential candidates to buck the prevailing hard-left tilt of their party, and they had a grand time doing it, with plenty of laughter.

Before their discussion, Carlson set the tone for the laughter to follow, sending up O’Rourke, who had given a massively egocentric answer when questioned about the little he gives to charity by essentially saying his giving was exemplified by his own candidacy. Carlson joked that O’Rourke was such a good person that he could write himself off his taxes if he wanted to, quipping, “The IRS would have to let him; his goodness is so clearly deductible. No lawyer would contest that. But Beto doesn’t do that; he doesn't shirk his duty. He’ll pay the extra tax because he cares that much. Now that you think about it, it’s almost sad he’ll never be president.”

Carlson then introduced Shapiro, who said, “I don’t know how I kept a straight face while you did that,” prompting Carlson to reply, “I don’t know how I did,” leaving them both laughing.

After they stopped laughing, Carlson got serious, commenting, “There are so many levels here but I do believe that this is the end of the Beto O’Rourke phenomenon.”

Shapiro responded, “Yeah, I think he’s toast.”

Carlson asked, “What are the lessons that we should draw from what we just saw?”

Shapiro answered, “I think that you can run in the moderate lane as the Bobby Kennedy candidate as long as there’s not anything newer on the block. Buttigieg came along and drank his milkshake and he had some intersectional credibility. The problem for Beto is that he happened to be straight and also white, just like Bobby Kennedy was; Buttigieg is gay, therefore he takes precedence, also he speaks more languages like Norwegian which is a language that is very much in vogue with the media these days.”

Carlson started laughing.

Shapiro continued, “And he doesn’t just play guitar, he also plays piano and he does it with Ben Folds 5 and the whole deal. So, Buttigieg has basically stolen all of his momentum, and I think you’re right, I think Beto is toast here.”

Carlson commented, “Speaking Norwegian and playing the piano, and I’m being sincere, are actually impressive things to do for sure, and I’m impressed by them, but they’re not really policy prescriptions, they’re not ideas that are going to improve America, neither is who you sleep with relevant to running the country as far as I can tell, or any of these criteria meaningful, so where’s the part that we get to debate their ideas for the country?”

Shapiro replied:

Well the problem is, obviously, that there’s only one thought leader in the Democratic Party right now and that’s Bernie Sanders. And what you’re seeing is a bunch of candidates who are attempting to steer into the Bernie Sanders lane. And there’s no room in that lane. Bernie Sanders has occupied that entire lane. You talk about ideas candidates – the one candidate who keeps shouting ideas from the rooftops is of course, our native American candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who keeps spouting ideas every five minutes, “Here’s a new policy prescription. Why isn’t anyone paying attention to me.” And the answer is because you are in Bernie Sanders’ lane. He is the thought leader in this lane. Well, in the moderate lane, there are no thought leaders – there are just a bunch of people with platitudes. Biden is presumably the thought leader, but Joe Biden doesn’t have enough thoughts to be a thought leader, so who, exactly, is going to come along and occupy that lane while still being able to win over the woke intersectional base of the Democratic Party? Whoever does that, has a possibility at the nomination. Right now Buttigieg can do that only insofar as he can speak the platitudes that sound moderate, but when he’s actually pegged down, as you’ve noted, he’s just as far left as Bernie Sanders is on all of the issues.

Carlson agreed: Here’s a guy whose telling us what a great Christian he is who’s for abortion up until birth? And for sex selection? Spare me your Christian talk, please. It’s absurd. I’m just struck though by Bernie could be the one guy — I mean I want to have a conversation about ideas ‘cuz I think it’s important, and clearly we need to make some changes with the way the country’s going — but Bernie doesn’t seem to be an ideas candidate when you listen to him, he almost never says anything — unlike Elizabeth Warren, he never says anything interesting. Why is that?

Shapiro: I think that his ideas are so radical, but they are consistent, and so everybody has followed him out to the fringe.

Carlson: Yes.

Shapiro: So, he can shout Medicare for All, and what you’ll see is every Democrat then pay homage to Medicare for All, footnote: we don’t really want Medicare for all, we want sort of a gradualistic plan that may achieve Medicare for All sometime in the future —

Carlson: Right.

Shapiro: — but everybody is trying to imitate Bernie. Bernie is the guy who is really running this race. Bernie’s almost in a position right now that Trump was in in 2016, where everybody in the Democratic Party who’s running is afraid to tick him off because they hope that eventually he’ll collapse and they’ll get his support, but he’s riding at 25 – 30% in virtually all of the polls. That support is extraordinarily durable; I don’t think that it’s going anywhere, and so he can steer that lane. He can win Iowa; he can win New Hampshire; he could do well in California and New York. There’s a reason that Democrats are running scared of Bernie, and what is puzzling to me is that they are so interested in what the journalists on Twitter say, this kind of echo chamber in the media say, but they won’t just go to where the mainstream of their own party is, which is the moderate area, right? Joe Biden is a terrible candidate — he’s actually leading in most of these polls (Carlson laughs) because he is perceived as a moderate.

Carlson: Totally true.

Shapiro: But that was true of Beto and Buttigieg, by the way, the reason that both of them were doing well for a moment there was because they are both perceived as moderate with all of the platitudes and then when you get down to policy, it turns out that they want to be more like Bernie than like Biden. Nobody in the Democratic Party actually has the stones to run as moderate inside the Democratic Party, even though it’s probably the best possible way for them to win the nomination.

Carlson: I think you’re absolutely right and your diagnosis is that they are captive of social media and that’s why.

Shapiro: I think they’re captive of social media. I think that they’re captive of the intersectional woke base. I think that they are afraid that they going to be held hostage to the dictates of The New York Times editorial board and people suggesting that they’re not woke enough if they don’t pay homage to the latest flavor, slavery reparations, or whatever it is today.

Carlson: I think the person who gives the finger to that mob, gets the support of millions.

Shapiro: I think that’s right, and then has a good shot in the general.

Carlson: Right.

Shapiro: But I don’t any of them have the actual stones to do it.

Carlson: They’d probably get my support. I mean if someone were to stand up and say, “You know what, I’m not taking orders from you. How does that sound?” I almost don’t even care what the person is for, I’d probably vote for them because I’m so desperate for that.

Shapiro: That is why, if a Democrat were actually able to do that, they would win sweeping support, but they can’t do that. But we’ve been saying this for years: All you have to do is not be crazy, and they can’t stop themselves. They just can’t.

Carlson, laughing: So good.

CUNY’s Medgar Evers College is getting set to disgrace itself — and slap Crown Heights in the face — by presenting the Rev. Al Sharpton with an honorary doctorate of humane letters.

The school’s Committee on Academic Policy, Programs and Research on Monday OK’d a proposal to honor Sharpton with the degree at the school’s June 5 commencement.

But Sharpton is no role model — not given his 30-plus-year record of racial incitement, demagoguery and financial shenanigans.

What makes this especially galling is that it’s to take place in Crown Heights, site of the 1991 anti-Jewish riots in which Sharpton played a key role in riling up the mobs.

The Rev has never apologized for his actions during those days, which included denunciations of Orthodox Jews as “diamond dealers” and a false claim that Jews operated an “apartheid ambulance service.”

Not until 20 years later did he finally admit he’d made some “mistakes,” while still claiming Jewish “extremists” deliberately misconstrued his remarks.

As we’ve long noted, little about Sharpton has changed over the years — save his weight, fancier clothes, fatter bank account and now-national platform. Medgar Evers College thinks that adds up to an “unwavering commitment to racial, educational and socioeconomic equity.” But those who’ve followed him know that Al Sharpton’s only “unwavering commitment” is to the glorification and enrichment of . . . Al Sharpton.

Sharpton has gotten honorary doctorates before. He even took to referring to himself as “Dr. Sharpton,” apparently unaware of what the word “honorary” means.

But he isn’t a worthy choice for this honor — especially not from a college named for a true civil-rights hero who paid the ultimate price for his genuinely “unwavering commitment” to racial justice.
Years ago, I lived in a remote mountain town that had never had a public library. The town was one of the largest in New York State by area but small in population, with a couple thousand residents spread out over about two hundred square miles. By the time my husband and I moved there, the town had lost most of its economic base—in the nineteenth century it had supported a number of tanneries and mills—and our neighbors were mainly employed seasonally, if at all. When the regional library system’s bookmobile was taken out of service, the town had no easy access to books. The town board proposed a small tax increase to fund a library, something on the order of ten dollars per household. It was soundly defeated. The dominant sentiments seemed to be “leave well enough alone” and “who needs books?” Then there was the man who declared that “libraries are communist.”

By then, through the machinations of the town board, which scrounged up $15,000 from its annual budget and deputized me and two retired teachers to—somehow—turn that money into a lending library, we had around three thousand books on loan from the regional library consortium tucked into a room at the back of town hall. We’d been advised by librarians at the consortium that five hundred library cards would take us through the first year. They took us through the first three weeks. Our librarian, whose previous job was running a used bookstore, turned out to be a master of handselling, even to the rough-and-tumble loggers and guys on the road crew who brought their kids in for story time and left with novels he’d pulled for them, and then came back, alone, for more. Books were being checked out by the bagful; there were lines at the circulation desk. Children especially, but sometimes adults, couldn’t believe it was all free.

By year’s end we had signed up about 1,500 patrons, and there was a book club, a preschool story hour, movie night, and a play-reading group. High school students, many of whom did not have Internet access at home, came in the afternoon to do their homework. People pressed books into the hands of strangers who did not stay strangers for long. And it occurred to me one Saturday, as I watched quilters sitting at our one table trade patterns and children clear the shelves of The Magic School Bus series, racing to check them out, that the man who had said that libraries were communist had been right. A public library is predicated on an ethos of sharing and egalitarianism. It is nonjudgmental. It stands in stark opposition to the materialism and individualism that otherwise define our culture. It is defiantly, proudly, communal. Even our little book-lined room, with its mismatched furniture and worn carpet, was, as the sociologist Eric Klinenberg reminds us libraries were once called, a palace for the people.

Klinenberg is interested in the ways that common spaces can repair our fractious and polarized civic life. And though he argues in his new book, Palaces for the People, that playgrounds, sporting clubs, diners, parks, farmer’s markets, and churches—anything, really, that puts people in close contact with one another—have the capacity to strengthen what Tocqueville called the cross-cutting ties that bind us to those who in many ways are different from us, he suggests that libraries may be the most effective. “Libraries are the kinds of places where ordinary people with different backgrounds, passions, and interests can take part in a living democratic culture,” he writes. Yet as Susan Orlean observes in her loving encomium to libraries everywhere, aptly titled The Library Book, “The publicness of the public library is an increasingly rare commodity. It becomes harder all the time to think of places that welcome everyone and don’t charge any money for that warm embrace.”

As Klinenberg points out:

“Infrastructure” is not a term conventionally used to describe the underpinnings of social life…[but] if states and societies do not recognize social infrastructure and how it works, they will fail to see a powerful way to promote civic engagement and social interaction, both within communities and across group lines.

To glimpse what he means, one need only dip into Frederick Wiseman’s epic and inspirational three-hour-and-seventeen-minute documentary Ex Libris, a picaresque tour of the grandest people’s palace of all: the New York Public Library system, a collection of ninety-two branches with seventeen million annual patrons (and millions more online). Wiseman trains his lens on the quotidian (people lining up to get into the main branch or poring over books), the obscure (a voice actor recording a book for the blind), and the singular (Khalil Muhammad discussing the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture), and without saying so explicitly (the film is unnarrated), he shows the NYPL to be an exemplar of what a library is and what it can do. Here we see librarians helping students with math homework, hosting job fairs, running literacy and citizenship classes, teaching braille, and sponsoring lectures. We see people using computers, Wi-Fi hotspots, and, of course, books. They are white, black, brown, Asian, young, homeless, not-so-young, deaf, hearing, blind; they are everyone, which is the point. If you want to understand why the Trump administration eliminated federal funding for libraries in its 2018, 2019, and 2020 proposed budgets, it’s on display in this film: public libraries dismantle the walls between us.

This is by design. A statement issued by the Public Library Association in 1982 called “The Public Library: Democracy’s Resource” said:

The public library is unique among our American institutions. Only the public library provides an open and nonjudgmental environment in which individuals and their interests are brought together with the universe of ideas and information…. The uses made of the ideas and information are as varied as the individuals who seek them. Public libraries freely offer access to their collections and services to all members of the community without regard to race, citizenship, age, education level, economic status, or any other qualification or condition.

Free access to ideas and information, a prerequisite to the existence of a responsible citizenship, is as fundamental to America as are the principles of freedom, equality and individual rights.

The public loves the public library. Klinenberg cites a Pew Research Center study from 2016 that showed that more than 90 percent of Americans consider the library “very” or “somewhat” important to their community. Pew researchers also found that about half of all Americans sixteen and older had used the library in the past year. Even so, libraries are often convenient targets for budget cuts. After the financial crisis, in the years 2008–2013, for example, New York City eliminated $68 million from the operating budget of the New York Public Library, which resulted in a dramatic drop in staff hours and in its acquisition budget. (A fair amount of Ex Libris is given over to poignant behind-the-scenes discussions about budgets.) But it wasn’t just the New York Public Library that was suffering. A study by the American Library Association around the same time found that twenty-one states reported cuts in library funding.

This had happened before, and is happening today: libraries, which are supported by local, state, and federal monies, as well as by private donations, are chronically underfunded and subject to the whims of politicians and philanthropists. In a 1972 letter published in these pages, a group of scholars and writers including Hannah Arendt, William Buckley, Ralph Ellison, and Betty Friedan, among many others, decried budget cuts that were curtailing services at the main branch of the New York Public Library:

At one time the Library’s doors were open to the public thirteen hours a day, on 365 days of the year; then the working man, the untrained, unmatriculated scholar could use freely and anonymously, at no cost to himself, the riches of the reference collections. A year ago, however, the Library’s financial crisis forced early closing of the reference division at 6 PM , and complete closing on weekends and holidays.

The signatories were asking for readers to contribute to the library’s research and reference collections. The letter ran under the headline “Crisis in the NY Public Library.” (The main branch is now open on Sundays for four hours; most of the smaller branch libraries are closed that day.)

In 2008 the private-equity billionaire Stephen Schwarzman donated $100 million to the cash-strapped NYPL . The library’s flagship Beaux-Arts building on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, which opened in 1911 and took sixteen years to complete at a cost of $9 million (plus $20 million for the land on which it sits), now bears his name. One hundred million dollars is a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to the philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie, the patron saint of libraries (and rabid industrialist), whose $55 million largesse—the equivalent of $1.6 billion today—funded 2,509 libraries worldwide, 1,679 of them public libraries in the United States, between 1886 and 1919. Sixty-seven of them were in New York City, sixteen of which are still in use.

Carnegie’s devotion to libraries was long-standing. His father helped found the Tradesmen’s Subscription Library in Dunfermline, Scotland, where he was a weaver and a member of the failed Chartist Movement. When industrialization cost him his job, the family emigrated to the Pittsburgh area, and at thirteen, after only five years of formal schooling, Carnegie was sent out to work, first as a bobbin boy in a cotton factory and later as a messenger for a telegraph company. Working boys were allowed to borrow one book a week from the private library of Colonel James Anderson, a successful local iron manufacturer and veteran of the War of 1812. Carnegie wrote in his autobiography:

It was from my own early experience that I decided there was no use to which money could be applied so productive of good to boys and girls who have good within them and ability and ambition to develop it, as the founding of a public library in a community which is willing to support it as a municipal institution. I am sure that the future of those libraries I have been privileged to found will prove the correctness of this opinion.

Carnegie’s first American library, in Braddock, Pennsylvania, was built about a hundred years after the founding of the first public library in what would become the United States. In 1790, the residents of Franklin, Massachusetts, chose to allow a collection of books donated to the town by its namesake, Benjamin Franklin, to be circulated among its residents without charge. In so doing, they chose not to follow Franklin’s lead: in 1731 he had founded a subscription library in Philadelphia. Massachusetts was also the site of the first major public library system, Boston’s, founded in 1854. Carnegie’s Braddock library was different from these: in addition to books, it had a 964-seat, velvet-curtained theater, a basketball court, and a swimming pool. Its mission was to exercise both mind and body. These days, the Braddock library, an imposing, turreted building up the hill from Carnegie’s shuttered steel mill, has fallen into disrepair, and a group is attempting to raise $10 million for renovations—not from a person of great wealth, but one billion pennies donated by the public. (They’ve raised $40,000 so far.)

Carnegie libraries stretch from one end of the country to the other, the 106 in New York State eclipsed by 142 in California. Six of these were in Los Angeles, a city of just over one hundred thousand at the turn of the twentieth century when Carnegie made his grants; three are still in use. No Carnegie money was used to build what would become the city’s Central Library. Founded in 1872 as a small fee-based organization whose five-dollar annual subscription was out of reach for most citizens, by 1933 it was circulating more books than any other library in the country.

Orlean nimbly documents this phenomenal growth, moving backward from the fire that roared through Central Library in 1986, while roving through the library as it is today, “an intricate machine, a contraption of whirring gears.” In so doing, she achieves on paper what Wiseman does on film: by acquainting the reader with the library’s actual infrastructure—the shipping department that sends 32,000 books around the city every weekday; the photography and map collections; the reference librarians on call to answer questions about, say, Pussy Riot, obituary etiquette, and the life span of parrots; the staff members who teach coding to children and connect homeless patrons with much-needed services—she reveals why it is such a valuable community resource and a perfect example of what Klinenberg is talking about when he extols the benefits of social infrastructure.

When the Los Angeles Central Library caught fire, it burned at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for seven hours. Four hundred thousand books were destroyed, among them the library’s entire collection of American and British plays, all the books about the Bible and church history, 45,000 works of literature, 18,000 social science books, 12,000 cookbooks, every bird book, 5.5 million patent listings dating back to 1799, and more, none of it covered by insurance. Orlean pursues in a desultory way the mystery of who—if anyone—started the fire, and why. Book burning, in her view, is a kind of genocide, a way to wipe out the collective memory of a people: Mao (a librarian himself), the Nazis, book-burning festival-goers during the Spanish Inquisition, and, just last year, a religious zealot who burned a number of LGBTQ children’s books he’d checked out from an Iowa public library—all engaged in “libricide” to incinerate ideas and erase whole swaths of history. If the Central Library fire was deliberate, to what end?

Like others who have investigated the fire, Orlean sets her sights on a mostly out-of-work actor and ne’er-do-well named Harry Peak, who may or may not have been in the building the morning of the fire, bumped into an older patron rushing out, been the young man shooed out of the staff room where he’d helped himself to a cup of coffee, been the same young man who was told to leave one of the library’s restricted areas, or been the blond young man in the picture drawn by a sketch artist after hearing descriptions of the person who had done these things. Arson turns out to be difficult to determine, especially in an aging building known to have faulty wiring, and Peak, who died in 1993, turned out to be a distinctively unreliable narrator. More than once he claimed to have been in the library that morning, yet at other times said he’d been nowhere near it. His alibis twist and turn and twist again, which was little surprise to those who knew him (his sister called him “the biggest bullshitter in the world”) but flummoxed law enforcement, who spectacularly failed to pin the crime on him, arresting him but eventually releasing him for lack of evidence.

Despite her best efforts, Orlean, too, is unable to solve the case. “The Central Library fire confounded me,” she writes. “As hard as I tried, I couldn’t completely convince myself that Harry started the fire.” For readers entertained by Peak’s peregrinations, this is of little consequence. His story is a sidebar to a bigger and more enchanting mystery: how a library rose out of almost nothing to become, as its name suggests, central to the residents of the second-largest city in the country, lending more than 900,000 books a year, answering six million reference questions, and welcoming 700,000 patrons. This nut Orlean easily and delightfully cracks.

The growth of Central Library mirrored the growth of Los Angeles. In 1873, when the subscription library opened, California had been a state for less than twenty-five years and Los Angeles had a population of fewer than 11,000 people. By 1904, the population had grown tenfold, and the library was circulating nearly 800,000 books a year. Fewer than twenty years later, when the number of residents was over half a million, one thousand books were being checked out each hour, about three million annually. Indeed, plotted on a graph, population growth and library circulation figures would appear coterminous. If this seems obvious, it’s only because we have come to assume the importance of libraries and their services to all members of the community.

What makes Central Library unique, and its story so entertaining, are the people who shepherded it through its metamorphosis. Many were women, well before librarianship became a female domain. Orlean introduces readers to Mary Foy, who in 1880, at eighteen years of age, took over Central Library’s forerunner, the subscription library that at the time didn’t allow women to borrow books and relegated them to a separate “Ladies’ room.” Two female librarians succeeded her, and then a third: a newspaper reporter from Ohio named Tessa Kelso, a short-haired, cigarette-smoking woman who was described at the time as “unconventional.”

Kelso had the foresight to anticipate the library as we now know it, imagining it to be a repository not only of books but of sporting equipment and board games and “the whole paraphernalia of healthy, wholesome amusement that is…out of the reach of the average boy and girl.” Before she could see that vision through, Kelso was pushed out of her job for adding to the collection Le Cadet, a novel by the French author Jean Richepin, which was considered risqué by some of the city’s arbiters of morality. She sued one of them, a Methodist minister named J.W. Campbell, for slander, and though she won (the church settled) she still lost her job.

Then there was Mary Jones, who was summarily dismissed in 1905 when the library board suddenly decided it would rather have a man running the library. Jones fought the decision, rallying a thousand women to petition the mayor and library board on her behalf, and, when that got no response, to take to the streets. She eventually gave up, moved east, and became head librarian at Bryn Mawr.

Orlean has the most fun recounting the misadventures and peccadillos of Jones’s successor, a bon vivant named Charles Lummis. Lummis was a writer whose first book, Birch Bark Poems, was published on birch bark he’d peeled and stitched together himself, and who gained national fame when he chronicled his walk from the east coast, where he’d dropped out of Harvard, to California, where he was to take up a position at the Los Angeles Times. His penchant for disappearing for weeks at a time to go tramping or to preside over orgiastic bacchanals eventually cost him his job at the newspaper and did not abate when he took over the library. Still, Orlean credits him with making the library “the institution it is today…[pushing] for it to become a serious research center for scholars” and establishing its photography collection, as well as collections of Spanish and Californian history. “His ambition was to make the library completely accessible—‘a workshop for scholars including every painter’s apprentice or working boy or streetcar man who wishes to learn, just as much as it includes the Greek professors or the art dilettante,’” Orlean writes, quoting Lummis. “His attitude of inclusiveness was unusual for the time. He campaigned to bring in patrons who hadn’t considered using the library before.” This is the essence and the calling of the public library today.

Last July an economics professor at Long Island University published an article in Forbes arguing that public libraries should be closed because they had outlived their usefulness now that Netflix streams movies, Starbucks offers free Wi-Fi, and, most conveniently, electronic books are instantly available from Amazon. Closing libraries in favor of Amazon would be a win-win, he said, because taxes would go down while Amazon’s share price would go up. The professor was especially enamored of the company’s cashierless storefronts, which, in his estimation, “basically combines a library with a Starbucks.” The “library” being referred to, it should be noted, is a commercial enterprise that sells books.

The reaction to the article, once readers realized that it wasn’t satire, was outrage and ridicule, and Forbes removed it from its website about seventy-two hours after it was posted. But the funny thing was that, inadvertently, the writer had made a strong case for the value and continued existence of the public library:

There was a time local libraries offered the local community lots of services in exchange for their tax money. They would bring books, magazines, and journals to the masses through a borrowing system…. They also provided residents with a comfortable place they could enjoy their books. They provided people with a place they could do their research in peace with the help of friendly librarians….

Libraries slowly began to service the local community more. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they aren’t for free. [Rather they are] financed by taxpayers in [the] form of a “library tax.”

Libraries, of course, were never “free” any more than public schools or public roads or public health nurses are free. One might expect a professor of economics to know this. Or for him to do the math: the per capita “library tax” for the Los Angeles County library system, for example, is only $32.77—or about nine medium-sized Starbucks lattes. There are nine Amazon Go stores in the United States and 16,568 public libraries, many in places where Amazon or Starbucks will never venture, like the branches in the far reaches of the Bronx and Los Angeles where Wiseman and Orlean take us, or the rural outpost where the library I helped found is located.

That library now has about 40,000 items on its shelves, including games and puzzles and sporting equipment, just as Tessa Kelso envisioned well over a century ago. Though small and lacking some of the amenities of a better-resourced community, it is a worthy successor to the libraries Carnegie funded. Those, it should be noted, were not “free” either: before he would make a grant, Carnegie required each town to commit to covering 10 percent of a library’s annual cost as well as supplying its building site. Grantees also had to agree to provide library services at no cost to patrons.

Perhaps the most definitive rebuke to the idea of trading libraries for Amazon and coffee shops comes from a former Starbucks employee whom Klinenberg met at a branch of the New York Public Library, where he is now an “information specialist”: “At Starbucks, and at most businesses, really, the assumption is that you, the customer, are better for having this thing that you purchase. Right?” he said. “At the library, the assumption is you are better. You have it in you already…. The library assumes the best out of people.” What we learn from The Library Book, Ex Libris, and Palaces for the People is that we are all better off, too, when people assume the best out of libraries.
Reporters Without Borders, the international group that compiles the World Press Freedom Index, ranked the United States 48th among 180 nations and territories it surveyed. The U.S. ranking fell three spots from 2018, continuing a downward trend that began in 2016.

The United States finished just above Senegal and just below Romania on this year’s list.

It also fell into the ranks of countries whose treatment of journalists is considered “problematic,” the first time the United States has been so classified since the organization began the index in 2002.

The top ranks were dominated once again by European countries: Norway ranked first for the third time in a row, followed by Finland, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark. The bottom of the list included, in descending order, Vietnam, China, Eritrea, North Korea and Turkmenistan.

The group cited both Trump’s rhetorical hostility toward the American news media and a possibly related phenomenon — increasing threats of harm against reporters — for the nation’s declining status.

Among other signs of poor press health, it cited the Trump administration’s curtailment of White House briefings; the revocation of CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s White House press pass; the banning of a second CNN reporter, Kaitlan Collins, from an open-media event; and the harassment of journalists at Trump’s reelection rallies. Beyond this, there were bomb threats made to newsrooms; an alleged murder plot aimed at prominent media figures and Democratic politicians by a Coast Guard lieutenant; and increased security measures in newsrooms nationwide.

It noted that “hatred of the media” reached the point where a gunman killed four journalists and another employee at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis in June.

“Amid one of the American journalism community’s darkest moments, President Trump continued to spout his notorious anti-press rhetoric, disparaging and attacking the media at a national level,” it said. “Simultaneously, journalists across the country reported terrifying harassment and death threats, online and in person, that were particularly abusive toward women and journalists of color.”

Journalists were also murdered last year in Malta, Mexico, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Ghana. Perhaps most infamously, Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian dissident, was murdered by government operatives in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last fall — a homicide that “sent a chilling message to journalists well beyond the borders of Saudi Arabia.”

Violence against journalists is routine in some parts of the world, as are campaigns of government intimidation and online harassment, the group said. It said only 24 percent of the nations in its survey could be classified as “good” or “fairly good” in their treatment of the press, a slight decline from last year.

The greatest regional deterioration worldwide, it said, was in the Americas, led by the decline of the United States, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil. Brazil recently elected a new president, conservative Jair Bolsonaro, who is sometimes called “the Trump of the Tropics” for his disparagement of political opponents, women and gay people and his frequent verbal attacks on Brazil’s news media.

The rankings are based on the responses of media professionals, lawyers and sociologists around the world to an 87-question survey that assess censorship and pluralism in each country. The results are combined with a database of reported abuses and violence against journalists.

Tezos long-term price prediction: Bullish

Before the positive move, XTZ was trading below a strong resistance turned support level of $0.6 for about four months before witnessing a price increase. The XTZ market was, however, subdued with choppy price action.

Buy/Sell Tezos (XTZ)

Last month, Tezos successfully surpassed the resistance level to $0.85 before a slight retrace near the break area of $0.06, which is now a solid support level for this pair. The token proceeded to paint a higher high, higher low pattern move to reach the current price level of $1.3. Still rising, XTZ may pull back to the $1.1 support level after striking the buying target which is probably at $1.4, the price drop level from November 2018.

Considering the long-term MACD, the actual scenario is revealed from the 2018 heavy drop (reflected at the negative zone) to the year 2019 rise (which is currently significant at the positive zone).

The ascending trend line (drawn in yellow) acts as diagonal support for the price action. A notable breach on the yellow line might result in sellers assuming control of the market. As of the time of writing, the bidders are creating a strong momentum.

Tezos medium-term price prediction: Bullish

Following the diagonal yellow line, still, XTZ appears bullish on a medium-term outlook as the price is currently moving towards the $1.45 resistance level.

Reaching the above resistance level, a possible swing low may visit support at $1, bottoming on the yellow line before another swing higher. A drive low on the said support could launch the bears into a selling momentum. If a strong bearish surge eventually plays out, a swing is likely to visit the $0.8 and $0.6 support levels.

Inversely, a clear breach above $1.45 resistance level might lead to more green formations.

More importantly, the 4-hour MACD has remained in the positive area since XTZ crossed up the zero level. Oscillating to the negative area could significantly depreciate the value of the token. Nevertheless, the bulls are currently in play in the Tezos market.

Tezos short-term price prediction: Bullish

Rising from a $0.95 low on April 14, Tezos has printed another high today, maintaining a zigzag (higher high, higher low) pattern. On a slow move, XTZ looks for a retracement level at the previous support of $1.2. A bounce on this support level is likely to propel XTZ to the $1.45 resistance.

Throughout last week, however, the token traded below $1 with sideways movement before a bullish surge hit the market. As reflected on the hourly MACD, the positive move is quite significant above the zero level. Shortly, the low wave is more likely to reflect on the indicator.

In case the MACD convincingly trends below the zero level, it could be an indicator for XTZ to drop to the $1 support level. Currently, the XTZUSD market maintains a short-term bullish sentiment.
One of the figures involved in the Obama administration's "Russiagate" scandal who has largely avoided scrutiny is former MI6 spymaster Sir Richard Dearlove, who is intimately linked to several key players in what many now believe was a high-level Set-up against the Trump campaign during the 2016 US election.

Dearlove, who served as chief of MI6 from 1999 to 2004, had contact during the 2016 campaign with dossier author Christopher Steele. He is also a close colleague of Stefan Halper, the alleged FBI and CIA informant who established contact with several Trump campaign advisers. Dearlove and Halper attended a Cambridge political event in July 2016 where Halper had his first contact with Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. -Daily Caller

Of note, Dearlove is best known for peddling a report alleging that Saddam Hussein had WMDs, which then-UK Prime Minister Tony Blair used to justify launching a war against Iraq.

In 2014, the retired British spymaster hosted an event at Cambridge University along with Halper. In attendance was then-director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Michael Flynn, as well as a Russian-born college student Svetlana Lokhova. Both Dearlove and Halper reportedly expressed concerns about Flynn's contacts with Lokhova - which the 38-year-old Russian-born academic says is complete bullshit.

Stefan Halper and the Pentagon, which paid him over $1 million during the Obama administration for "research."

"General Flynn was the guest of honor and he sat on one side of the table in the middle. I sat on the opposite side of the table to Flynn next to Richard Dearlove because I was the only woman at dinner, and it's a British custom that the only woman gets to sit next to the host," Lokhova told Fox News, who added that she has never been alone with Flynn. On the contrary, the unplanned encounter was professional and mildly productive.

Dearlove - who has feigned not knowing "Trump-Russia" dossier author Christopher Steele, discussed ongoing matters with the former MI6 spy during a meeting in London's posh Garrick Club according to the Washington Post.

And as the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross points out, "Despite his presence at those key junctures, Dearlove has mostly dodged media attention, as well as that of American lawmakers investigating the origins of the Russia probe," adding "That’s perhaps a testament to Dearlove’s 38 years in MI6."

As journalist Daniel Lazare wrote last year in Consortium News,

A few things stand out about this august group. One is its in-bred quality. After helping to run an annual confab known as the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar, Dearlove and Halper are now partners in a private venture calling itself “The Cambridge Security Initiative.” Both are connected to another London-based intelligence firm known as Hakluyt & Co. Halper is also connected via two books he wrote with Hakluyt representative Jonathan Clarke and Dearlove has a close personal friendship with Hakluyt founder Mike Reynolds, yet another MI6 vet. Alexander Downer served a half-dozen years on Hakluyt’s international advisory board, while Andrew Wood is linked to Steele via Orbis Business Intelligence, the private research firm that Steele helped found, and which produced the anti-Trump dossier, and where Wood now serves as an unpaid advisor. Everyone, in short, seems to know everyone else. But another thing that stands out about this group is its incompetence. Dearlove and Halper appear to be old-school paranoids for whom every Russian is a Boris Badenov or a Natasha Fatale. In February 2014, Halper notified US intelligence that Mike Flynn, Trump’s future national security adviser, had grown overly chummy with an Anglo-Russian scholar named Svetlana Lokhova whom Halper suspected of being a spy – suspicions that Lokhova convincingly argues are absurd.

Dearlove, meanwhile, has showered praise upon Halper - a longtime suspected CIA and FBI informant, and has been involved in US politics at the highest levels for decades, becoming George H.W. Bush's National Director for Policy Development during his presidential campaign. After Bush lost to Reagan, Halper worked as Reagan's Deputy Assistant Secretary of State - where he served under three different Secretaries.

He then became a senior advisor to the Department of Defense and DOJ between 1984 and 2001. Halper's former father-in-law was Ray Cline, former Deputy Director of the CIA. He also allegedly spied on the Carter administration - collecting information on foreign policy (an account disputed by Ray Cline).

Halper received a DoD contract from the Obama administration for $411,575 - made in two payments, and had a start date of September 26, 2016 - three days after a September 23 Yahoo! News article by Michael Isikoff about Trump aide Carter Page, which used information fed to Isikoff by "pissgate" dossier creator Christopher Steele. The FBI would use the Yahoo! article along with the unverified "pissgate" dossier as supporting evidence in an FISA warrant application for Page.

Most famously, however, Halper is known for infiltrating the Trump campaign on behalf of the Obama DOJ - spying on advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, who he lured into his orbit under the guise of seeking legitimate professional relationships.

Meanwhile, his buddy Richard Dearlove has remained largely out of the spotlight despite his glaring connections to Russiagate.
The Democratic National Committee may have an overcrowding problem on its hands, and is considering ways to address it.

After relaxing its rules, the party must now accommodate a sprawling field of presidential candidates who have qualified for the first two primary debates this summer. Based on the current formula, 15 hopefuls have already earned a spot on stage for the first nationally televised debate, which will be spread over two nights, June 26-27.

But following the second debate on July 30-31, some of those same candidates might not make subsequent cuts. Sources with direct knowledge told RealClearPolitics that the DNC is considering a rule change.

“This sort of low entry point into the debates is not going to last forever,” one party official said before mentioning possible higher standards in terms of fundraising and polling that would create “a natural winnowing before we get to Iowa.”

“That is the conversation we are having right now. And it is incumbent on the party not to put our thumb on the scale — everyone is very cognizant of what happened in 2016 — but also not to let this thing drag out.”

Democrats are haunted by Hillary Clinton’s candidacy four years ago, which, some complained, was more of a coronation than a real contest for the nomination. Primary opponents Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley repeatedly griped that party brass had rigged the system in her favor. Both accused the DNC of limiting the number of debates and manipulating their schedule to shield the front-runner.

Hoping to avoid accusations of favoritism this time around, Democrats decided to democratize the process. DNC Chairman Tom Perez announced new rules in February that prioritize national polling as much as emphasizing grassroots fundraising to qualify for 12 total debates. To punch their ticket, candidates must either score above 1 percent in three polls or rake in donations from at least 65,000 unique donors (with a minimum of 200 donors in each of at least 20 states).

“Because campaigns are won on the strength of their grassroots, we also updated the threshold, giving all types of candidates the opportunity to reach the debate stage and giving small-dollar donors a bigger voice in the primary than ever before,” Perez explained.

The initial requirements for qualification were never set in stone to begin with, however, and applied specifically to the first two primary debates. During a March 22 interview with CSPAN, Perez left the door open to higher standards for subsequent debates.

“In all the prior primaries, we saw the thresholds evolve as the campaigns evolved, and this will be no different,” he noted.

“I think it’s important for candidates to show that they've made progress. We haven't made firm decisions on what those thresholds will be but it’s absolutely undeniable that as we move forward we will adjust the thresholds to reflect the fact that we're closer to the caucus and to voting.

“We will do it thoughtfully,” he added, without offering any specifics.

The current requirements have set up a June battle royale in Miami where heavyweights will mix it up with lesser-known long shots. It will be an opportunity for front-runners to solidify their status and for dark horses to break out of the pack.

It also bears an uncanny resemblance to early Republican primary debates in 2016 when Donald Trump ran roughshod over more than a dozen other contenders. Critics belittled those GOP contests at the time as “clown shows,” and while Democrats insist their field will be better behaved, some fear under-performing candidates will succumb to temptation, act out and, in the process, cannibalize the party.

“How sharp are those elbows going to be?” a party official asked. “If this is a really contentious and nasty primary and we’ve done the work of the Republicans for them, it’s going to be much harder for us to beat Donald Trump.”

Seth Masket, a professor of political science at the University of Denver, explained the predicament: “When you have this many candidates and there is no obvious heir apparent, no sitting vice president or someone who came close last time around, it makes it very hard for the party to pick a favorite, and these additional candidates make it hard for people to coordinate on someone.”

Any attempt to head off that potential problem from the top down risks cultivating alienation and bitterness among voters, cautioned longtime Republican operative Tim Miller. “Democrats might regret putting together a system that allows for a fragmented field to continue for a long time,” he said.

Looking from the outside in, the former Jeb Bush spokesman also warned that “while the easy take from the sidelines is to say ‘Democratic leaders should get together and pick two or three people to narrow the field,’” picking favorites “would have massive downstream negative backlash consequences.”

Democrat brass has taken steps to head off any sour-grapes complaints: Another party official told RCP that campaigns have been briefed ahead of time that the qualifying requirements for debates that will resume in the fall could change.

“It is just like the NBA: You know that in order to get into the playoffs you have got to have a certain record,” the official said. “If you don’t get it, you are going into the next draft. Everyone understands those are the rules of the game. That is how it is played.”

If the rules do change ahead of the third debate in September and a candidate misses the cutoff, they won’t find much sympathy over at the DNC headquarters. Any complaints that the party lent an unfair advantage, the official insisted, would be “disingenuous.”

“We have to avoid this sore loser mentality of ‘Well, because I didn’t get in even though I knew things were going to be more difficult or I didn’t do the things I knew I needed to do to get in, then that is a problem with the institution,’” the official said.

“You have to own it because it is your campaign. If you aren’t getting the traction, you have to look in the mirror and ask why you’re not getting that traction. It isn’t the DNC that’s doing that. It isn’t the DNC’s job to promote your campaign. It’s your job,” the official continued.

The Democratic National Committee did not return RCP requests for comment.
Und wieder ein Datenskandal bei Facebook : Diesmal ist herausgekommen, dass das Unternehmen seit Mai 2016 die Kontaktdaten von 1,5 Millionen neuen Mitgliedern ohne deren Erlaubnis auf seine Server kopiert hat.

Facebook hat die Kontakte von 1,5 Millionen neuen Nutzern ohne deren Zustimmung auf seine Server kopiert und auf Basis dieser Daten die Verbindungen zwischen diesen Personen hergestellt und gespeichert. Das teilte Facebook nach einer Anfrage von Business Insider selbst mit. Das Unternehmen will die Daten nun löschen. Mit Dritten - also Werbepartnern - seien sie nicht geteilt worden.

Hintergrund ist eine Anfang April 2019 entdeckte Praxis des sozialen Netzwerks, seit Mitte 2016 bei Neuanmeldungen in bestimmten Fällen auch nach dem Passwort für das E-Mail-Konto zu fragen. Der Nutzer, der dieses Vorgehen entdeckt und publik gemacht hatte, hatte es als "grauenhaft" bezeichnet - was vermutlich so gut wie jeder Sicherheitsforscher ähnlich sehen dürfte.

Facebook hatte dann auf Nachfrage von Golem.de unter anderem erklärt, das Passwort des E-Mail-Kontos werde nicht gespeichert und das Verfahren komme künftig nicht mehr zum Einsatz. Business Insider schreibt nun, dass den Redakteuren aufgefallen sei, dass immer dann, wenn der Nutzer beim Anmeldeprozess tatsächlich das Passwort seines E-Mail-Kontos angegeben habe, ein Fenster aufgetaucht sei, demzufolge die Kontaktdaten "importiert" würden - ohne vorher nach der Erlaubnis zu fragen und ohne weitere Erklärung.

Business Insider fragte bei Facebook nach Details. Daraufhin räumte das soziale Netzwerk nun ein, tatsächlich die Kontaktdaten kopiert zu haben. Die Daten sollen nun gelöscht und die betroffenen Nutzer innerhalb der nächsten Tage informiert werden. Nach Angaben von Facebook sei all das "unbeabsichtigt" geschehen, die zugrunde liegenden Prozesse würden geändert.

Facebook fällt immer wieder mit Pannen beim Umgang mit den Daten seiner Mitglieder auf. Mitte März 2019 etwa war bekanntgeworden, dass die Facebook-Passwörter von rund 600 Millionen Nutzern im Klartext vorlagen und den Firmenmitarbeitern frei zugänglich waren.

Now that Mueller’s $40 million Humpty Trumpty investigation is over and found wanting of its original purpose (to retire Trump), perhaps the ruling class can return without interruption to the business of destroying the world with ordnance, greenhouse gases, and regime changes. A few more CIA-organized blackouts in Venezuela (it’s a simple trick if one follows the Agency’s “Freedom Fighter’s Manual”), and the US will come to the rescue, Grenada style, and set up yet another neoliberal regime. There is a small solace that with Trump, Pompeo, and Bolton, there is at least a semblance of transparency in their reckless interventions. The assessed value of Guaido and Salman, they forthrightly admit, is in their countries’ oil reserves. And Russians better respect the Monroe Doctrine and manifest destiny if they know what’s good for them. Crude as they may be, Trump’s men tell it like it is. And when Bolton speaks of “the Western Hemisphere’s shared goals of democracy, security, and the rule of law,” he is of course referring to US-backed coups, military juntas, debt bondage, invasions, embargoes, assassinations, and other forms of gunboat diplomacy.

That the US is not already formally at war with Russia (even with NATO forces all along its borders) has only to do with the latter’s nuclear arsenal deterrent. Since World War II, a period some describe as a “a period of unprecedented peace,” the US war machine has wiped out some 20 million people, including more than 1 million in Iraq since 2003, engaged in regime change of at least 36 governments, intervened in at least 82 foreign elections, including Russia (1996), planned more than 50 assassinations of foreign leaders, and bombed over 30 countries. This is documented here and here.

Despite unending US and US-supported assaults on Africa and western and central Asia, the authors who see postwar unprecedented peace argue that it Russia and China, not the US, that represent the real threats to peace and deserve to be treated as “outcasts.” That NATO has warships plying the Black Sea and making port calls at the ethnically Russian Ukraine city of Odessa and is conducting war games from Latvia to Bulgaria and Ukraine represents unprecedented peace? While NATO, which together has 20 times the military spending of Russia and includes member states along virtually the entire perimeter of Russia, in Western propaganda Russia is the aggressor.

Although the US corporate media may have missed the news, the rest of the world gets the fact that the greatest threat to peace on the planet is Uncle Sam. In 2013, a WIN/Gallup International poll of 66,000 people in 65 countries found that the US was considered by far the most dangerous state on earth (24% of respondents), while Russia didn’t even register statistically on that poll. In 2017, a Pew poll found the same perception of US power and that such a view had increased to 38% and had grown in 21 of 30 countries compared to 2013. Even America’s neighbors, Canada and Mexico, see the US as a major threat to their countries, worse than either China or Russia. The mainstream media (MSM) stenographers’ myopia in failing to cover this story is not an oversight. Carl Bernstein, of Watergate exposé fame, documented in 1977 the fact that from the early 1950s to the late 1970s, the MSM (New York Times, Washington Post, NBC, ABC, CBS, and the rest) had regularly served as overseas informers for the CIA. It would be hard to believe that those ties are not still intact given the level of collaboration among the CIA, the MSM, and the Democratic Party in the Russiagate conspiracy drama.

Context is everything. In blaming others for the instability of the Middle East, it is important to bear in mind that for 36 years since Reagan launched air attacks on Beirut and parts of Syria, the US, and its ally Israel, has been using the greater Middle East region as a testing ground for its weapons systems. This has meant repeated bombing and droning of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Libya, Somalia, Iran, Yemen, Kuwait, and Sudan, and increased weapons sales to the region to assure continuous instability and profits. The US has “special forces” operating in two-thirds of the world’s countries and non-special forces stationed in three-quarters of them, altogether over 800 military bases and installations in as many as 130 countries (the Pentagon refuses to give the exact number). By comparison, apart from several bases in some of the former Soviet republics, Russia has a naval resupply facility in Vietnam and small temporary leased naval and airport stations in Syria. China opened a combined naval and army base in Djibouti in 2017 and an “unofficial military presence” in Tajikistan. There is nothing remotely close to equivalence.

We can expect a continuing outcasting of Russia, either under a second Trump presidency or, if the long dark shadow of the Clintons prevails, a Joe Biden White House. Biden claims without the benefit of evidence that currently “the Russian government is brazenly assaulting the foundations of Western democracy around the world,” as if the huge imbalance of military forces and the long history of US interventions against liberal democracies and socialist states were unknown or irrelevant. In his (and the establishment’s) heavy-handed uses of propaganda, Biden has learned well the tactics of Goebbels – repeat the lies often enough to make the imperial state appear as the victim.

With regard to a brazen assault on democracy, Biden might take a cue from Clinton, who knew how to capitalize on her power position by signing off on huge arms sales to the Saudis (e.g., a $29 billion sale of fighter jets to that country to be used against Yemen) and other Gulf States while securing tens of millions of dollars in donations from the sheikhs ($25 million from Saudi Arabia alone) to her private foundation, run by her husband. This is all the more contemptuous given that she acknowledged in 2013: “The Saudis and others are shipping large amounts of weapons… clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region…and pretty indiscriminately – not at all targeted toward the people that we think would be the more moderate, least likely, to cause problems in the future.”

In other words, she knew the Saudis and other Gulf dictators were arming ISIS (ISIL) and other caliphate actors but continued to keep them as allies and patrons. She also took $800 thousand for her 2016 campaign (almost double what Trump received) and some $3 million for her private foundation from oil and gas companiesafter approving lucrative gas pipeline in the Canadian tar sands. Part of the foundation staff’s business was to arrange meetings of top donors meetings with the then secretary of state. Following Clinton and Obama’s lead and without a second thought, Trump has authorized US energy companies to sell the Saudi monarchy nuclear power technology and assistance.

In foreign policy, indeed, it’s hard to see any meaningful difference between Republican and Democratic administrations. Obama and John Kerry sent Undersecretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Victoria Nulandto Kiev’s Maidan to cheer on the 2014 coup, hand out sandwiches to protesters, and give marching orders to her ambassador there to arrange for Yatsenyuk to be prime minister and to “fuck the EU.” Poroshenko, a regular informer at the US embassy, as WikiLeaks revealed, was already in the bag for president. Biden was brought in to “midwife” and “help glue this thing” by pressuring the still-ruling Yanukovych to step down in favor of the US-designated coup leaders. Along the same lines, Trump’s then ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, joined Venezuelan protesters outside UN headquarters in New York, using a megaphone to publicly call for a coup against Maduro. “I will tell you,” she told the group, “the U.S. voice is going to be loud.”

Both the Ukraine and Venezuela interventions are in part a grand strategy to isolate Russia. However, the orchestration of a new Cold War against Russia and to implicate Trump as a Kremlin puppet has failed, and the problem for Russiagate propagandists is how to keep the conspiracy theory alive now that Mueller’s unsuccessful hunt for 5thcolumnists is in the dustbin. The leading Russia scholar, Stephen Cohen, who has been professionally marginalized because of his skepticism toward the CIA narrative, sees the impact of a larger scandal – the corruption of the Democratic Party and its minions in the media that formed an alliance with the spooks. He asks: “what about the legions of high-ranking intelligence officials, politicians, editorial writers, television producers, and other opinion-makers, and their eager media outlets that perpetuated, inflated, and prolonged this unprecedented political scandal in American history…?”

Another question is, how would the mainstream media financially survive an ending of Russiagate, if indeed the media moguls allow it to end? This spectacular failure of the “fourth estate” in covering the Clinton and Democrats’ defeat in 2016 greatly weakened their trust status, which has been in quite steady decline since the 1970s, especially among Republicans. Democrats tend to look more favorably on the largely partisan liberal MSM for obvious reasons. However, as of December 2018, according to an IPSOS/Reuters poll, only 44% of Americans has much (16%) or some (28%) confidence in the MSM, compared to hardly any (48%). On whether MSM news organizations are more interested in making money than telling the truth, 59% agreed with the former assessment. No known organization has published findings on MSM trust since the completion of the Mueller debacle.

What is to be made politically of the Russia obsession? Russiagate, which Matt Taibbi calls “this generation’s WMD,” can be seen as serving three broad major purposes. It has given the Democratic Party leadership and its partners in the CIA and MSM a cause célèbre inorder to salvage the status and image of the party and distract from its disastrous electoral defeats from 2008 to 2016. It thereby serves as an alternative reality to the widespread recognition that the ruling forces in the party have no genuine popular agenda and represent corporate, banking, neoliberal, and neoconservative militarist projects designed under Bill Clinton’s New Democrat agenda.

On foreign policy, Russiagate puts the Democrats to the right of the Republicans, similar to the way that John Kennedy in the 1960 campaign accused the Eisenhower (and VP Nixon) administration of weakening America’s defenses, which presently enables the energy and defense industries and their lobbyists to unduly influence the perception of international threats and flashpoints. Democrats in the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly for the 2019 $716 billion defense budget, over and above what even Trump requested. In 2018, five military contractors – Northrup Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Raytheon – provided key political leaders in both parties with $14.4 million in addition to $94 million spent on lobbying efforts that year. Oil & gas spent $89 million on the election campaign and $125 million on lobbying. And, third, it serves to stifle the political left in and outside the party and the demands for progressive legislative changes activated by Bernie Sanders in 2016 and by newer members like Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Tulsi Gabbard.

Where is the center of public political confidence these days? Certainly not with the mainstream media, which is even lower than that for Trump. Even in terms of its vaunted claims of press freedom, the US fares quite badly. Reporters Without Borders ranked the US number 45th worldwide (of 180 countries cited) in press freedom in its 2018 report. Tory-led Britain slid from 33rd in 2014 to 40th– only Italy and Greece were behind the UK among western European countries. And although Trump hasn’t helped with his attacks on the media (and more than reciprocated by the media’s extraordinarily hostile coverage of the president), the situation wasn’t much better under Obama, who threatened whistle blowers in the press with enforcing the 1917 Espionage Act. This is law that may be pressed against the journalist Julian Assange. There still exists no “shield law” guaranteeing journalists the right to protect their sources’ identities. Journalism students should be concerned for another reason as well:Newspaper employment between 2001 and 2016 has been cut by more than half, from 412,000 to 174,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

William Arkin, who quit NBC News as a political commentator last January, accused the station of peddling “ho-hum reporting” that “essentially condones” an endless US war presence in the Middle East and Africa. He also took the network to task for not reporting “the failures of the generals and national security leaders,” and essentially becoming “a defender of the government against Trump” and a “cheerleader for open and subtle threat mongering.”

In his parting comments, he wrote: “I’m alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically … be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war.… Even on Russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the Cold War?”

It may be whistling in the wind, but there are more important things to worry about than whether “the Russians” exposed the DNC’s perfidious behavior in 2016. It would be more worthwhile for Democrats to demand programs that eliminate child poverty, which is at 20% in the US, compared to an OECD average of 13%. It might also be useful to concentrate a bit more on the white working class and working poor that went to Trump in 2016, whose kids make up 31% of the child poverty bracket (black children are 24%, and Latino children are 36%).

And while they’re at it, they might try to change the fact that the US ranks 25thout of 29 industrialized countries in investments in early childhood education or the fact that the disgraceful American infant mortality rate at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births is 50% higher than the OECD average (3.9%). Many of the parents of these less privileged children are serving long sentences in prison for non-violent crimes, the discarded citizens who form the highest incarceration rate in the world. Overall, the Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty ranked the US 18th out of 21 wealthy countries on measures of labor markets, poverty rates, safety nets, wealth inequality, and economic mobility. On the other hand, the US has more than 25% of the world’s 2,208 billionaires. This is American exceptionalism at its worst.

The corporate-run market system and the calamities it is bringing to the world depends on such distractions. As the New York Times journalist and defender of US global supremacy, Thomas Friedman, has noted, “The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist. McDonald’s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the designer of the U.S. Air Force F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley’s technologies to flourish is called the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.” In his view, the system needs protecting, for which his “journalism” and most of the MSM are certainly doing their part.

Unless the rather soft left within the Democratic Party can somehow capture the public imagination, the Democrats’ political agenda, the MSM and their cohorts in the deep state will likely continue to report fake Russian conspiracies around the world. Russiagate is a propaganda industry that keeps on giving. In the longue durée of American elections, the question is what discourse will dominate the next campaign – social justice and a rational foreign policy or more aggressive polemics about Russia aimed at a steady pathway to nuclear war?
Enquanto a maior parte das democracias avançadas constata o fracasso do paradigma da guerra contra as drogas, o Brasil não apenas mantém o modelo que não funcionou como ainda o aprofunda.

A recém-lançada Política Nacional sobre Drogas, do governo Jair Bolsonaro (PSL), mostra-se um retrocesso em relação às versões de administrações anteriores —que não chegavam a ser animadoras.

Durante mais de um século, o mundo tentou eliminar o consumo de entorpecentes. Apostou-se na proibição, na repressão, com encarceramento de traficantes e usuários, e, para o tratamento, numa psiquiatria autoritária, não raro pior do que uma prisão. Os resultados foram parcos.

Gastaram-se bilhões em preciosos recursos públicos, sem que se conseguisse coibir o uso nem o abuso de maneira perceptível.

A partir principalmente dos anos 1980, nações da Europa Ocidental se arriscaram em abordagens mais liberalizantes, marcadas por maior tolerância com o usuário e novas práticas psiquiátricas.

Dos anos 2000 para cá, mais países abandonaram o paradigma proibicionista. Até os EUA, que eram a meca da guerra às drogas, fizeram, em âmbito estadual, experimentos de legalização da maconha, cada vez mais disseminados.

No Brasil, Bolsonaro revisita a velha fórmula. Nega a necessidade de estabelecer critérios objetivos para distinguir traficantes de usuários e, talvez mais danoso, prioriza tratamentos baseados em abstinência, reduzindo o espaço para iniciativas de redução de danos.

A abstinência constitui de fato um objetivo, em especial para dependentes pesados. Mas é equívoco imaginá-la como precondição para o tratamento. Ao fazê-lo, alija-se um grande contingente de pacientes que poderiam se beneficiar de estar em contato com serviços de saúde e talvez se dispusessem, no futuro, a tentar suspender o uso.

Recorde-se, num exemplo doméstico, o malogro da abordagem linha-dura contra a cracolândia na gestão de João Doria (PSDB), em São Paulo. A prefeitura ao menos reconheceu, na prática, que era contraproducente abandonar as ações de redução de danos.

Inexiste solução simples, é forçoso reconhecer —soa irrealista, nesse sentido, a meta de reduzir em 80% o número de usuários da cracolândia, anunciada pelo tucano Bruno Covas, sucessor de Doria. O mínimo a fazer, de todo modo, é deixar de insistir no erro.

Republican strategist Gustavo Portela said the 2020 Alabama Senate race is an “important opportunity” for the GOP to start supporting an alternative candidate to Roy Moore Roy Stewart MooreGOP Senate campaign arm hits battleground-state Dems over 'Medicare for All,' Green New Deal The Hill's Morning Report — Category 5 Mueller storm to hit today GOP leaders dead set against Roy Moore in Alabama MORE, even though a new poll shows the former state Supreme Court Chief Justice is leading the field of potential candidates.

“It an important opportunity for Republicans to gather around a Republican candidate that is not Roy Moore early on,” Portela, executive director of Accuracy in Media, told Hill.TV on Wednesday.

Portela made clear he does not personally support Moore, calling him the “scum of the Earth,” and said Moore isn’t the only one who can beat Sen. Doug Jones (D) in the deep-red state.

“I, as a Republican, do not want to see him running, but here we are,” Portela said.

When reached for comment, Moore responded with a statement saying: "For 'Republican strategist' Gustavo Portela to refer to me as 'scum of the earth' shows the depths to which our political system has deteriorated, and the animosity of the Washington Establishment who fear the truth about God and the Constitution, for which I stand."

He went on to say the "false allegations" against him are "the same weapon" that was used against Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughJuan Williams: Buttigieg already making history Dems plot next move in Trump tax-return battle Fight over census citizenship question hits Supreme Court MORE, Justice Clarence Thomas and President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump calls Sri Lankan prime minister following church bombings Ex-Trump lawyer: Mueller knew Trump had to call investigation a 'witch hunt' for 'political reasons' The biggest challenge from the Mueller Report depends on the vigilance of everyone MORE and "will be used against anyone else who opposes the liberal Washington DC agenda."

Shortly before the 2017 election, Moore faced multiple allegations that he harassed or pursued women who were in their teens when he was in his 30s. He denied the allegations.

According to a survey by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy Inc., Moore leads potential GOP candidates, with 27 percent of the vote.

Among the would-be GOP candidates included in the poll, only Rep. Bradley Byrne Bradley Roberts ByrneGOP leaders dead set against Roy Moore in Alabama GOP strategist: Alabama Republicans need to 'gather around' candidate who 'is not Roy Moore' The Hill's Morning Report — Combative Trump aims at Pelosi before Russia report MORE (R-Ala.) has formally announced a Senate bid. He received support from 13 percent of respondents in the survey.

Portela downplayed the significance of Moore’s early lead.

“Polling-wise you never want to look good early,” he told Hill.TV.

Moore, who lost to Jones during a special election in 2017, has not made an official announcement on whether he will jump in the 2020 race. But he has said he hasn’t ruled out another Senate bid, arguing the previous race was “stolen” from him.

“I’m seriously considering it. I think that [the 2017 Senate race] was stolen,” Moore told the Christian program “Focal Point” last month.

Jones has already stated that he would welcome a rematch with Moore. The Alabama Democrat told Politico in a February interview that if Moore thinks the 2017 race was unfair, he should run again.

“If he really believes that and if the Republican Party really believes that then they all ought to just step aside, have a press conference with him and let's just do it again," Jones said.

“Where is your home? It’s going to be nowhere,” said Regina Williams-Preston, a city councilwoman who is currently running for mayor, expressing frustration at Buttigieg’s priorities. “I’m just constantly telling the administration,” she said, “If we do what we’ve always done, we’ll get what we’ve always gotten. And what we have always gotten in cities all across the country is displacement of poor people and people of color.”



The South Bend residents I spoke with, however, highlighted the success of the program. “Pete was coming in after some really big impacts, given the population loss and the age of the housing stock—but also on the heels of the foreclosure and mortgage crisis,” Kathy Schuth, executive director of Near Northside Neighborhood told me. South Bend lost 30 percent of its population in the first decade of this century. “Some big moves were needed and I think he was trying to do something that wouldn’t just piecemeal it, but would have a big impact.”



“It wasn’t perfectly implemented,” said Schuth, “but it gave a needed boost and has had a lot of good effects.”



“It really was an achievement,” longtime South Bend Tribune columnist Jack Colwell told me. “Driving around the city you would see those empty buildings.” Colwell described many of the buildings as “not the type of places you would want people to reside.” Because of the declining population, the columnist said, there just wasn’t the need for the surplus. “They didn’t tear them all down—they fixed up some. But I think it was a good thing to be rid of them.”



Buttigieg also used “big data” (an idea popular with the McKinsey set) to update the city’s sewers and streets. “Smart Streets,” an initiative aimed at changing traffic patterns and converting one-way streets into two-way thoroughfares in an effort to increase business and development, was initially controversial—no one likes road work—but is now applauded. “In an amazingly short period of time, it just rocketed the city forward. It really is truly impressive,” St. Mary’s College political science professor Patrick Pierce told me. “You saw an increase in the number of businesses that were located downtown—just a lot more activity. Now, it’s pretty lively late into the night. There’s a lot of stuff going on culturally; it’s a lot more interesting.”



The effort to turn South Bend into a “Silicon Prairie” hub, however, has had more mixed results. In Shortest Way Home and in campaign statements, Buttigieg touts his efforts to modernize the local economy, repeatedly walking through a former Studebaker plant that has been converted into a data center. “Inside a vast, empty space with high brick walls and broken windows, civic and business leaders gathered around the dream of a different economy, perhaps even a “Silicon Prairie” of data centers in our part of the Midwest,” he wrote in his memoir. But less than two percent of workers in South Bend have tech jobs.



“The city has increasingly become an appendage of Notre Dame, a wealthy Catholic private university,” wrote Benjamin Studebaker, a descendent of the family that owned South Bend’s former economic engine. “The people who once upon a time might have worked good union jobs at Studebaker now work increasingly in the ‘food and serving’ sector, whipping up fancy coffees and craft booze for the rich kids.”



Studebaker observed that in “food and serving,” one of South Bend’s five largest employment sectors, the median worker is paid $13,400 per year. In the large, specialized “healthcare and social assistance” industry, it’s only “marginally better,” Studebaker said, “$25,612.”



The revitalization of South Bend owes perhaps as much to luck as it does to initiatives like 1,000 Homes and Smart Streets. Buttigieg became mayor at a moment of economic revitalization and oversaw the city during a period of growth—the decline in South Bend’s unemployment rate, though impressive, probably owes more to macroeconomic trends than to the leadership of its young mayor. Similarly, the transformation of South Bend’s economy from manufacturing to the service sector began decades ago.



South Bend residents are more likely to point to Buttigieg’s ineffable qualities as mayor, his ability to listen, and the shift in outlook that they believe has taken hold since he entered office.



“I think the city was probably ready to start bouncing back,” Colwell told me. “But I think that it bounced back farther because of the change in attitude when Pete came in. People had been stymied in their economic development efforts—Pete [targeted those people] and said ‘How can we help you? Sure we can do that.’”



Pierce, the political science professor, highlighted Buttigieg’s receptivity to feedback. “Part of his moderate approach to politics is an openness—and this sounds odd—to learn. There are plenty of folks in politics who simply keep going the same way and doing the same thing over and over and over and he’s really not like that.”



“He’s really ready to listen and ready to learn and change course when it’s necessary,” said Pierce.



It’s not clear if any of this is transferable, if the skills used to transform America’s 299th largest city are applicable to managing a country of 320 million, if skills honed updating traffic patterns and sewer systems can be applied to intractable problems like income inequality and health care access and affordability. For all of Buttigieg’s experience managing large teams, the Senate is likely a better school for understanding the issues that move national politics. But Buttigieg’s career took hold by focusing on smaller issues rather than big ones, and the people of South Bend say it worked.
Gamers of a certain age probably remember being wowed by the quick, smooth scaling and rotation effects of the Super Nintendo's much-ballyhooed "Mode 7" graphics. Looking back, though, those gamers might also notice how chunky and pixelated those background transformations could end up looking, especially when viewed on today's high-end screens.

Emulation to the rescue. A modder going by the handle DerKoun has released an "HD Mode 7" patch for the accuracy-focused SNES emulator bsnes . In their own words, the patch "performs Mode 7 transformations... at up to 4 times the horizontal and vertical resolution" of the original hardware.

The results, as you can see in the above gallery and the below YouTube video, are practically miraculous. Pieces of Mode 7 maps that used to be boxy smears of color far in the distance are now sharp, straight lines with distinct borders and distinguishable features. It's like looking at a brand-new game.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about these effects is that they take place on original SNES ROM and graphics files; DerKoun has said that "no artwork has been modified" in the games since the project was just a proof of concept a month ago. That makes this project different from upscaling emulation efforts for the N64 and other retro consoles, which often require hand-drawn HD texture packs to make old art look good at higher resolutions.

How it works

Games that made use of the SNES "Graphics Mode 7" used backgrounds that were coded in the SNES memory as a 128x128 grid of 256-color, 8x8 pixel tiles. That made for a 1024×1024 "map" that could be manipulated en masse by basic linear algebra affine transforms to rotate, scale, shear, and translate the entire screen quickly [Update: The original version of this story misstated the tileset and resolution for Mode 7 backgrounds. Ars regrets the error].

Some Mode 7 games also made use of an additional HDMA mode (Horizontal-blanking Direct Memory Access) to fake a "3D" plane that stretches off into the horizon. These games would essentially draw every horizontal scanline in a single SDTV frame at a different scale, making pieces lower in the image appear "closer" than ones far away.

It's a clever effect but one that can make the underlying map data look especially smeary and blob-like, especially for parts of the map that are "far away." This smearing is exacerbated by the SNES' matrix math implementation, which uses trigonometric lookup tables and rounding to cut down on the time needed to perform all that linear algebra on '90s-era consumer hardware. Translating those transformation results back to SNES-scale tiles and a 420p SD screen leads to some problems on the edges of objects, which can look lumpy and "off" by a pixel or two at certain points on the screen.

The HD Mode 7 mod fixes this problem by making use of modern computer hardware to perform its matrix math "at the output resolution," upscaling the original tiles before any transformations are done. This provides more accurate underlying "sub-pixel" data, which lets the emulator effectively use the HD display and fill in some of the spaces between those "boxy" scaled-up pixels.

For those tilt-shifted HDMA Mode 7 games, the HD mod also eliminates "some limitations of the integer math used by the SNES... by more aggressive averaging," DerKoun says. This gets rid of those rounding errors from the actual SNES hardware, straightening out lines and positioning tilted background tiles more accurately.

Byuu, the lead coder on the bsnes project, says DerKoun's HD Mode 7 mod will be integrated into the next major release of the emulator. Then the project will officially join the growing list of other emulation efforts that actually improve on the performance of the original hardware, including WideNES , RetroArch's LAGFIX latency mitigation and 4K upscaling for PS3 and Wii U games , to name just a few.

The governor of Wisconsin wants to renegotiate the deal in which iPhone-assembler Foxconn would have received $4 billion in subsidies and infrastructure spending in exchange for employing 13,000 people.

Foxconn has changed its plans several times since the deal was first announced, and Gov. Tony Evers no longer believes all those promised jobs will ever emerge

“Clearly the deal that was struck is no longer in play and so we will be working with individuals at Foxconn and of course with (the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.) to figure out how a new set of parameters should be negotiated,” Evers said today, according to the Journal Sentinel.

Foxconn’s shifting plans for Wisconsin

Although Foxconn is famous for assembling the iPhone for Apple, it never intended to do so in Wisconsin. Instead, the original deal called for Foxconn to produce large-sized displays for televisions and monitors in this midwestern state. Its manufacturing plant was expected to cost $10 billion to build, and employ those thousands of Wisconsin residents.

In return, the Taiwanese enterprise would receive $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives, and another $1 billion in infrastructure.

But the company’s production plan was later changed to small and medium-sized LCDs, some of which potentially could have been used in Apple products. And the goal was modified even more this January, to making products for the industrial and health care fields. Through this, Foxconn maintained that it would provide 13,000 jobs.

To further confuse the situation, in February the plan changed back to making small displays after President Trump put pressure on company CEO Terry Gou. The president has been a visible part of bringing Foxconn to Wisconsin from the beginning.

Gov. Evers clearly has had enough. “It’s our goal to make sure that the taxpayers are protected and environmental standards are protected. And we believe we need to take a look at that contract and see if it needs to be downsized as a result.”
The smartphone industry often latches on to a notion of success in smartphone design. Fueled by the Internet hype culture, the prospect of their names etched in history books and the all-important bragging rights, the idea of fullscreen smartphone design has been treated the same way. In the pursuit of a truly bezel-less display, smartphone makers, and in turn, the industry has gone on quite the journey.

What began with uninterrupted panels on smartphones like the Sharp Aquos and Mi Mix was taken a ‘notch’ further by the Essential PH-One and the trendsetting iPhone X. Over the next year, the cutouts were reduced to a teardrop-style notch à la OnePlus 6T, but since the front camera was indispensable, there wasn’t much room for improvement. Or so we thought.

In came Chinese innovation with the likes of the Vivo Nex and Oppo Find X hiding their cameras and sensors in motorized pop-up units. These phones finally achieved that “fullscreen” aesthetic by tucking the necessary peripherals behind the display. Devices like the Mi Mix 3 were quick to follow with mechanical, manual alternatives.

With this also came advancements in biometrics, and phones had finally become what pop culture and hype had imagined them to be. But innovation doesn’t stop.

On Wednesday, Samsung launched a new addition atop their Galaxy A Series of midrangers, the Galaxy A80.

Galaxy A80, Go 180°

Samsung’s Galaxy A80 is a bezel-less slider phone with a new interpretation of the camera setup. To take a detour from Notch City, the phone uses an upward slider with a triple camera unit that swivels mechanically.

Samsung has introduced this phone as the first handset equipped with the “New Infinity” display, which unlike the rest of Samsung’s new roster has no notches or cutouts.

The Spec Sheet

The phone comes equipped with Samsung’s new ‘Smart Battery’ with a super-fast 25W, 3700mAh adaptive powerpack.

The A80 has an FHD+ Display with a 2:1 extra tall aspect ratio. On the inside, the phone is expected to pack a Snapdragon 730G series SoC running two cores at 2.2 GHz and 6 cores at 1.7 GHz, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM. For biometrics, there is facial scanning and an in-display fingerprint scanner. The phone will be available in Angel Gold, Ghost White and Phantom Black colours based on your region.

The Camera

The automated pop camera consists of three sensors. The main 48-megapixel f/2.0 camera is flanked by a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor and an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide sensor.

When the front camera is summoned, the whole module rises with the pop-up slider and flips around to the front. This eliminates the need for a selfie camera and also readies the traditionally better rear camera for clicking self-portraits with the main and group selfies with the wide angle.

The selling point of the A80 has been set at EUR 649 which roughly translates to INR 51,000, positioning the phone in the ‘budget flagship’ category.

Critics have reiterated that usage of mechanical parts in smartphones is a step backward as it compromises durability and resistance to the elements. While the half-life of a slider may take some time to fully evaluate, one thing’s for sure: in the coming months, it’s gonna be time to say goodbye to the notch. See you on the flip side!

Galaxy A80 joins A10, A20, A30, A40, A50 and A70. More on them here. Follow @my_mobile_reviewer for the best mobile reviews.
11h48 - PSD anuncia, no Fórum TSF, que vai apresentar uma proposta para "instar o Governo a construir um oleoduto" para o Aeroporto Humberto Delgado, na próxima reunião da Câmara Municipal de Lisboa

PUB

11h32 - A Associação Portuguesa de Empresas Petrolíferas (Apetro) afirma que repor a situação existente antes do início da greve pode demorar até cinco dias.

10h57 - O racionamento do combustível para o público irá manter-se, para já, confirmaram à TSF o Ministério das Infraestruturas e da Habitação e o Ministério do Ambiente e da Transição Energética.

O público pode realizar abastecimentos de até 15 litros de gasolina ou gasóleo, enquanto o restabelecimento total dos combustíveis não estiver finalizado. Consulte aqui a lista de postos de abastecimento prioritários (Anexo VIII, página 55 do documento).

10h07 - Em declarações à TSF, o vice-presidente do Sindicato dos Motoristas de Matérias Perigosas garantiu que os motoristas vão esforçar-se ao máximo para que o abastecimento de combustível regresse ao normal até à próxima segunda ou terça-feira, embora não possa garanti-lo.

8h48 - "É um dia para celebrar", diz Pedro Pardal Henriques, vice-presidente do Sindicato Nacional de Motoristas de Matérias Perigosas. O sindicalista afirma que este dia vai marcar a diferença no resto da vida dos motoristas de matérias perigosas. Pedro Pardal Henriques considera que o acordo alcançado é um "feito histórico" e sublinha que nunca tinha sido conseguido algo assim tão depressa.

A decisão de desconvocar a greve foi tomada devido à garantia, por parte da ANTRAM e do Governo, de que iriam dar início às negociações para um acordo coletivo de trabalho e que haveria um desfecho para esse compromisso até ao final do presente ano, explica o vice-presidente do sindicato.

Pardal Henriques constata que, em apenas três dias, o país ficou num "estado de calamidade" e que se a greve se prolongasse a situação ainda iria piorar. O sindicalista considera que ficou claro para o país qual a importância destes profissionais.

8h45 - Presidente da ANTRAM explica que, a partir desta tarde, os motoristas de matérias perigosas já estarão a fazer turnos completos, mas que é normal que o volume de combustível para os próximos dias "ainda não seja o que todos esperaremos". Motoristas esperam que a situação comece a normalizar nos próximos dias.

8h40 - "Temos de olhar para trás, perceber o que se passou e discutir aquilo que as pessoas que entenderam fazer greve pedem e merecem", diz Gustavo Paulo Duarte, presidente da ANTRAM.

O líder da ANTRAM reforça que este foi um processo difícil, sublinhando que não sabe fazer negociações em greve, optando por negociar primeiro e só depois, se não houver entendimento, avançar para uma paralisação - e daí o diferendo com a escolha feita pelo Sindicato Nacional de Motoristas de Matérias Perigosos.

Gustavo Paulo Duarte refere que, a partir de agora, serão iniciadas as negociações para um acordo coletivo de trabalho, ressalvando que as mesmas devem ser encaradas com "um espírito construtivo" e com "responsabilidade económica e social".

8h32 - Pedro Nuno Santos ressalva que a normalização não acontecerá de imediato, que será um processo gradual, embora estejam reunidas todas as condições para que a mesma seja resposta.

8h30 - Ministro responde a críticas e garante que o Governo esteve sempre a trabalhar desde a primeira hora para conseguir terminar a greve o mais depressa possível, mas respeitando todas as partes.

8h27 - "Motoristas tiveram uma importante vitória, fizeram-se ouvir, foram ouvidos e conseguiram o processo negocial para a dignificação e valorização do seu trabalho", diz o ministro, deixando também elogios à posição correta e leal tomada pelo sindicato.

8h23 - Pedro Nuno Santos começa a declaração, afirmando que foi possível chegar a um acordo com que todos se sentissem confortáveis, após três dias difíceis, de incerteza e insegurança.

8h18 - O ministro das Infraestruturas e da Habitação está vários minutos atrasado para a declaração ao país.

O ministro Pedro Nuno Santos, fez uma declaração, esta manhã, pelas 8h00, no Ministério das Infraestruturas e da Habitação, para anunciar o fim da greve dos motoristas de matérias perigosas, que, nos últimos três dias, originou uma crise dos combustíveis que tem causado o caos no país.

O Sindicato Nacional de Motoristas de Matérias Perigosos (SNMMP) e a Associação Nacional de Transportadores Rodoviários de Mercadorias (ANTRAM) também prestaram declarações esta manhã.

Já esta madrugada, após 10 horas de reunião, o Governo, o SNMMP e a ANTRAM, tinham chegado a acordo para o alargamento dos serviços mínimos a todo o território - depois da contestação gerada pela anterior decisão que estabelecia que os mesmos só abrangiam os centros urbanos de Lisboa e Porto.

Ainda na quarta-feira, o Governo anunciara a criação de uma rede de 310 postos prioritários de abastecimento no país. Apesar de o objetivo passar por dar prioridade às entidades prioritárias, o público pode realizar abastecimentos de até 15 litros de gasolina ou gasóleo, enquanto o restabelecimento total dos combustíveis não estiver finalizado.

Notícia atualizada com correção da estimativa da data em que o abastecimento de combustível retomará a normalidade

Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. From config server to OAuth2 server (without inMemory things) — Part 2

Marcus Hert Da Corégio Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 17

Introduction

Hello everyone, in this second part we will build the auth service. This is the guy we are looking for in this guide.

The first part is available here.

We will not use those inMemory configurations, the auth service will be built on top of a MongoDB and will be able to create users, authenticate them, store their tokens/refresh tokens and revoke it if needed.

Remember that the code is available on GitHub.

Creating the Auth Service

Let’s start creating the auth-service, we will use Spring Initializr to create the maven project. Generate it like the image.

Adding annotations

Import the generated project in your favorite IDE.

Open AuthServiceApplication class to add some annotations. Start with the @EnableResourceServer annotation, it will enable a Spring Security filter that authenticates requests via an incoming OAuth2 token.

The next one is @EnableDiscoveryClient which we already know, it will enable the discovery client implementation to let our auth service register in Registry Service.

The last one is @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity which enables Spring Security global method security. Set the prePostEnabled field from the annotation to true to enable Spring Security’s pre post annotations, we will use them later.

@SpringBootApplication

@EnableResourceServer

@EnableDiscoveryClient

@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)

public class AuthServiceApplication {

public static void main(String[] args) {

SpringApplication.run(AuthServiceApplication.class, args);

}

}

Adding the application’s configuration files

Rename the application.properties file to bootstrap.yml and add the following configuration:

spring:

application:

name: auth-service

cloud:

config:

uri: http://localhost:8888

fail-fast: true

password: 1234

username: user

In the config service application, create the auth-service.yml file to hold the configuration for auth service.

spring:

data:

mongodb:

host: localhost

port: 27017

username: oauth-user

password: password

database: oauth-db

server:

servlet:

context-path: /uaa

port: 8081

If you don’t know why these files are being created, I recommend you to read this article’s first part.

Creating the domain entities and its DAO

Let’s start creating the authorities enum.

import org.springframework.security.core.GrantedAuthority;



public enum Authorities implements GrantedAuthority {

ROLE_USER;



@Override

public String getAuthority() {

return name();

}

}

This enum is responsible to define the authorities of our auth service and it implements the GrantedAuthority interface which represents an authority granted to an Authentication object.

Now create the User entity to represent our user.

@Document

public class User implements UserDetails {

@Id

private String id;



@Indexed(unique = true)

private String username;



private String password;



private boolean activated;



private String activationKey;



private String resetPasswordKey;



private Set<Authorities> authorities = new HashSet<>();

...getters and setters

}

I omitted the getters and setters for the sake of simplicity, but you can check them here. The User class implements the UserDetails interface who provides core user information to be encapsulated into Authentication objects. The @Document , @Id and @Indexed annotations are used by Mongo, I’ll not enter in details here, but you can ask in the comments section.

Create the UserRepository to be our DAO.

import com.marcusdacoregio.authservice.domain.User;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;



import java.util.Optional;



@Repository

public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {

Optional<User> findByUsername(String username);

}

And now our custom implementation of the UserDetailsService , it is a core interface which loads user-specific data. It is used throughout the spring framework as a user DAO and is the strategy used by the DaoAuthenticationProvider. You can read more about it in the official documentation.

@Service

public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {



private final UserRepository userRepository;



public CustomUserDetailsService(UserRepository userRepository) {

this.userRepository = userRepository;

}



@Override

public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {

return userRepository.findByUsername(username)

.orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException("Username " + username + " not found"));

}



}

Ok, until here we created some needed classes to deal with our users.

Now we will create the classes to deal with our clients, which are the resource servers whose wants to use the authentication. Let’s start the class who represents the detail of an authorization client.

@Document

public class AuthClientDetails implements ClientDetails {

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;



@Id

private String id;



private String clientId;



private String clientSecret;



private String grantTypes;



private String scopes;



private String resources;



private String redirectUris;



private Integer accessTokenValidity;



private Integer refreshTokenValidity;



private String additionalInformation;

...getters and setters

}

You can check the details for the getters and setters from this class here. It’d be nice to check out the documentation for ClientDetails .

The next class is AuthClientRepository to be our DAO for AuthClientDetails .

@Repository

public interface AuthClientRepository extends MongoRepository<AuthClientDetails, String> {

Optional<AuthClientDetails> findByClientId(String clientId);

}

Now the class AuthClientDetailsService , it implements the ClientDetailsService which is a service interface to provide the details about an OAuth2 client.

@Service

public class AuthClientDetailsService implements ClientDetailsService {

private final AuthClientRepository authClientRepository;



public AuthClientDetailsService(AuthClientRepository authClientRepository) {

this.authClientRepository = authClientRepository;

}



@Override

public ClientDetails loadClientByClientId(String clientId) {

return authClientRepository.findByClientId(clientId).orElseThrow(IllegalArgumentException::new);

}

}

In the next section, we will start to configure security and OAuth2 in Spring.
An illegal alien who was released into the United States by former President Obama’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has now been charged with killing a St. Paul, Minnesota, father of ten.

On April 3, 19-year-old Jose Orlando Vasquez-Guillen, of El Salvador, was allegedly driving drunk in St. Paul with a blood alcohol level of about 0.149 — nearly double the legal limit, according to law enforcement officials.

Vasquez-Guillen, according to police, was speeding when he hit Mark O’Gara, who was pulling out of a driveway with a woman in his car. When paramedics arrived, O’Gara was treated on the scene but soon died. The woman in the car with him had left to seek treatment for non-life threatening injuries at a hospital.

O’Gara leaves behind his wife, Leanna, and their ten children and six grandchildren, as well as his brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews.

The illegal alien blamed O’Gara for the crash and admitted to having three beers prior to the accident, law enforcement officials said. Vasquez-Guillen has been charged with vehicular homicide for the death of O’Gara and has been released into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

Records obtained by Breitbart News reveal that the Obama administration released Vasquez-Guillen in March 2016 after being taken into custody for illegally crossing the United States-Mexico border two months before. The policy, known as catch and release, has continued unchanged.

Like millions of other border crossers and illegal aliens, Vasquez-Guillen was supposed to show up in immigration court but never did. In August 2016, an immigration judge ordered him deported, but he never was.

Since the end of last year, DHS has released about 133,500 border crossers and illegal aliens into the U.S. — a population more than double the population of Portland, Maine, and nearly triple the population of Galveston, Texas. Current data suggests that DHS releases more than 1,000 border crossers and illegal aliens into the U.S. every day.

Cardiovascular disease is the world’s leading cause of death. Heart transplants are often the only option available for patients in the worst cases. But the number of heart donors is limited and too many patients die while waiting.

What if hospitals could simply print out a new heart?

That’s the tantalizing promise that Tel Aviv University researchers made this week with the announcement that they had successfully used a 3D bio-printer to create a heart complete with human tissue and blood vessels.

While the university called it a “major medical breakthrough” that advances the possibilities for transplants, this 3D-printed heart still has some thumping limitations.

First, it’s only the size of a rabbit’s heart. Journalists who attended the press event in Tel Aviv were shown a 3D print of a heart that looked more like a cherry, immersed in liquid.

Second, the cells in the 3D heart can contract, but don’t yet have the ability to pump. Researchers must now figure out how to teach the printed hearts to behave like real ones.

This is not the first heart to be 3D printed, but never before has it resulted in an organ “with cells or with blood vessels,” said Tal Dvir, who led the project at Tel Aviv University’s School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology.

Previously, scientists in the emerging field of regenerative medicine have been able to print cartilage and aortal valve tissue, but not the capillaries without which the organs cannot survive, let alone function properly.

Dvir said the researchers’ next steps would be to transplant a 3D-printed heart into an animal model. Their aim is for that to happen sometime in the next year.

“Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,” Dvir added, although he expected hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts.

Could solve rejection problem

A 3D-printed heart may be able to bypass one of the most serious problems involved in transplants: rejection of the new organ by the patient.

The Tel Aviv University researchers propose to use a biopsy of a patient’s own fatty tissue in the development of a “personalized hydrogel” that will serve as the “ink” necessary to print the heart.

“The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardizes the success of such treatments,” Dvir said.

In that way, 3D-printed hearts – and ultimately many other types of human organs – would essentially be customized to the specific patient.

Dvir added that he hopes organ printing will render organ donation obsolete.

That said, there are other challenges on the road ahead. Current 3D printers are limited by their resolution; that makes it hard to print all of the many tiny blood vessels. And the researchers need to determine how to expand the cells so that they have enough tissue to print a full human-sized heart.

But this week’s announcement was a major step forward, as “larger human hearts [will] require the same technology,” Dvir explained.

In addition to Dvir, the team included Dr. Assaf Shapira of Tel Aviv University’s Faculty of Life Sciences and doctoral student Nadav Noor.

The Tel Aviv tale of this tell-tale heart was published on April 15 in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Science.
FILE - In this undated file photo provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a blacklegged tick, also known as a deer tick, rests on a plant. Non-native ticks, including some with significant veterinary and medical importance, are showing up in Alaska and health officials fear a warmer climate may allow them to become established. A collaborative project between the University of Alaska and state wildlife and veterinary officials is working to understand the risk of non-native ticks such as blacklegged ticks and pathogens they could carry. (CDC via AP, File)

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Health and wildlife officials are taking steps to prepare for potentially dangerous parasites that could gain a foothold because of Alaska’s warming climate.

Non-native ticks represent a threat to wildlife and people because they can carry and transmit pathogens, said Micah Hahn, an assistant professor of environmental health with the Institute for Circumpolar Health Studies at the University of Alaska Anchorage.

“Things are changing really rapidly in Alaska,” she said. “It’s really important for us to establish a baseline. We need to know what ticks are already here, what ticks are established and reproducing, and where they are, so that we can monitor these changes as the environment changes in the future.”

A $125,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health will help sample ticks and prepare a model to forecast where ticks could thrive, she said Tuesday in a presentation to the Local Environmental Observer network, whose members report unusual animal, environment and weather events.

Researchers will look for ticks in the field. Researchers, wildlife officials and the state veterinary office also are encouraging biologists and the public to participate in a “Submit-a-Tick” program, in which they pluck blood-sucking arachnids from people and pets, drop them off at Department of Fish and Game offices and fill out a form with details of their capture.

Alaska is largely free of many pests that bedevil people elsewhere, from snakes to creepy-crawly insects. Alaska’s handful of native ticks attach themselves to squirrels, snowshoe hares and wild birds and sometimes moose, dogs, or cats, but no one buys bug repellent or tick collars to keep them at bay.

However, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game nearly a decade ago began to collect tick samples out of concern that moose ticks, which can kill moose, especially calves, could establish themselves in Alaska.

Moose ticks have been found within Alaska’s neighbor, Canada’s Yukon Territory.

“We are nervous that it’s very close to our border,” Hahn said.

The search for moose ticks led to the recovery of a variety of non-native ticks, she said. Most were associated with travel outside the state. Researchers believe they hitch rides on people and pets but also migratory birds.

In some cases, non-native brown dog ticks and American dog ticks were found by people who had not left the state in months, Hahn said. “The question is, where did that tick come from?”

Officials have created an online Alaska tick information page with instructions on how to collect ticks. Researchers will use data collected to create a model focused on two nonnative ticks of concern, blacklegged ticks and western blacklegged ticks. Both can transmit Lyme disease. Ten Alaskans reported Lyme disease in 2017 but all were exposed in other states.

Just because non-native ticks reach Alaska, it doesn’t mean they will survive, Hahn said. Some ticks are vulnerable to dry conditions or harsh winters. The models will coordinate tick sampling information with environmental conditions in Alaska, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, to project where non-native ticks might thrive in future decades as climate conditions change.

Alaska doctors and veterinarians don’t now automatically consider a connection to ticks if a person or pet shows up for treatment and has not traveled, Hahn said.

“If we know what species are here, and where they are in the state, it can help us develop control measures to make sure we stay on top of the problem,” Hahn said.

A man was taken into custody in New York Wednesday night after entering St. Patrick’s Cathedral carrying two canisters of gasoline, two bottles of lighter fluid and two butane lighters, authorities said.

The 37-year-old man, whose identity will be released once he is formally charged, was stopped by a cathedral security officer, New York City Police said. As the man was turned around, he spilled some gasoline on the floor and walked south onto Fifth Avenue and over to 50th street.

Cathedral security notified two Critical Response Command (CRC) officers-- part of a "striker team"-- outside the cathedral.

Investigators said the man was cooperative but acted evasively and offered police inconsistent answers. He told officers that he was “cutting through the cathedral to get to Madison Avenue” and that "his car ran out of gas," police said. But when police checked the man's minivan, it's gas tank wasn't empty.

The man was taken into custody and brought to the Midtown North Station House, police said. It is too early to consider terrorism but “I think, if added to that the events at the iconic location of Notre Dame and all of the publicity around that, I think this is an indicator of something that would be very suspicious,” John Miller, deputy commissioner of intelligence & counterterrorism of the NYPD, said.

The FBI is assisting in the investigation. Officials said a "heavy police presence" was in the area of the church, which is located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.

The incident at St. Patrick's Cathedral occurred days after Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral was badly damaged in a fire. engulfed with flames for hours.

Two-thirds of the cathedral burned before the fire was brought under control. The incident is being investigated as an accident.

SHAH ALAM: The impressions on a mannequin after it was hit by the door of the Emergency Medical Rescue Services (EMRS) van matched the injury marks on firefighter Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim’s chest, the coroner’s court was told today.

Retired Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) forensic pathology professor Dr Shahrom Abd Wahid said even though the marks generated were not 100% the same, they could be perceived as similar.

Shahrom said Adib was probably pulled out of the EMRS van and sustained injuries to his front chest before he was hit again, causing seven fractures to his rear left ribs.

“We slammed the door on the mannequin as it was pulled out of the van. It generated a similar pattern (to Adib’s injury marks). We were able to match it with the injuries on the victim’s right chest,“ he told the inquest into Adib’s death.

Shahrom dismissed the possibility of the fractures to Adib’s front right ribs due to falling and hitting a road curb. He said the wounds resembled the rubber fitting on the EMRS van’s door frame.

“I did test other objects that could possibly cause this form of injury but from re-enactment of the incident, hitting a road curb did not match the injuries at all,“ he said.

During the inquest Shahrom also said Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL) pathologists should have included a colour scale when taking the photographs of Adib’s bruises during the post-mortem.

Shahrom was asked to assess a triangle-shaped bruise on Adib’s right arm from a photograph taken during the post-mortem by conducting officer Hamdan Hamzah.

The inquest resumes at 9.30am tomorrow.
Barr has said the report has two parts: one on Russian tampering efforts and one on alleged obstruction of justice by Trump

Five key things to look for in the Mueller report

On Thursday, the US justice department is expected to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s long-awaited report on Russian election tampering and the Donald Trump campaign to the public. The attorney general, William Barr, has announced a press conference at the justice department at 9.30am to discuss it.

Mueller report: redacted Trump-Russia findings to be released today – live Read more

Barr has previously described the Mueller report as having two parts: one part devoted to describing the Russian tampering efforts, believed to include a rundown of Russian contacts with Trump campaign officials; and one part devoted to evidence of alleged obstruction of justice by the president.

Here are five things to look out for with the release of the report, which reportedly runs to nearly 400 pages and is officially titled Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election:

Mueller report: the key takeaways from the Trump-Russia investigation Read more

Obstruction of justice

The Mueller report “catalogu[es] the President’s actions” that could amount to an obstruction of justice by Trump, according to an earlier letter issued by Barr summarizing his view of the report’s findings. How much of this catalogue will the public get to see on Thursday?

Mueller left the decision of whether to charge Trump to Barr, who decided not to. But it appears that Mueller gathered substantial evidence of potential obstruction of justice by the president. In his letter, Barr quoted this line from the report: “While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

What did Mueller, a lifelong prosecutor, see or discover that led him to believe that the president might have committed a crime?

Contacts with Russia

According to Barr, the Mueller report does exonerate the Trump campaign from allegations that it conspired with Russia. In his letter, Barr quoted the report: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

But there are signs that the report contains new information about contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives. One source close to Mueller’s team told NBC News that the report “paint[s] a picture of a campaign whose members were manipulated by a sophisticated Russian intelligence operation”.

Trump’s political base appears to be unbothered by his campaign’s contacts with Russia, and by his subsequent chronic lying about those contacts. But could the report put those contacts in a new light?

Redactions

Mueller delivered his report one month ago, on 22 March. Since then, Barr and colleagues in the justice department have been preparing it for release to Congress and the public.

A big question is how much of the report will be redacted. Barr is seen as a Trump loyalist with a low opinion of Mueller’s investigation. Barr will probably be challenged to explain why certain material was deemed unfit for public view. Democrats in the House have already said they will subpoena the full report.

Barr has described to Congress four categories of material he intended to redact and said the redactions would be color-coded by category: first, grand jury information, including witness interviews; second, classified information; third, information related to continuing investigations; fourth, so-called derogatory information – information about people who were interviewed or scrutinized in investigations but not charged.

That last category could prominently include Trump.

Summaries

In the report, Mueller’s team included multiple summary paragraphs intended for quick public release after the report was submitted to Barr, according to multiple media accounts. Some members of Mueller’s team were reported to have been displeased that Barr did not release the summaries.

The report was prepared “so that the front matter from each section could have been released immediately – or very quickly”, one official not on Mueller’s team told the Washington Post. “It was done in a way that minimum redactions, if any, would have been necessary, and the work would have spoken for itself.”

Will we see the summaries? Will they be significantly redacted?

Scenes

Based on media reports and previous indictments, the public knows some of what was going on behind the scenes as the Trump campaign lurched toward victory in 2016, Russian operatives dangling off it, leech-like, on all sides.

But the Mueller report, which would draw on material not available to journalists, such as surveilled communications and seized evidence, could reveal what was really happening in some of the set pieces from the Trump campaign and early presidency.

We might find out more about what happened at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and whether Trump was ignorant of the meeting, as he claims. New evidence could come to light about the firing of former FBI director James Comey. We could learn more about Trump campaign contacts with WikiLeaks.

The report could contain damaging new information about the conduct of Trump family members, including Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner, who have been accused of using the campaign to try to enrich their companies and keeping up inappropriate, if not illegal, contacts with foreign operatives.

The Mueller report might weigh in on whether Trump told Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, as Cohen has alleged, or whether Trump tried at least twice to fire Mueller, only to be stopped by the former White House counsel Don McGahn, as has been reported.

But key sections of the Mueller report might remain redacted for now.
Progressive organizations and the Democratic Party recognize the centrality of Florida for the 2020 presidential election and have been working to deploy a massive ground game to register voters, increase turnout and lobby Floridians against President Donald Trump.

With its 29 Electoral College votes, Florida is the nation’s biggest swing state and is critical to Trump’s path to victory in the upcoming race. If statewide 2016 voting patterns are repeated, the Democratic candidate for president would be able to win the White House by capturing Florida and one other swing state – Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin or Michigan.

A centerpiece of the Democrats’ swing state efforts revolve around a Florida state amendment that was passed last year restoring voting rights for felons, with progressive groups battling efforts to require the state’s nearly 1.4 million ex-felons to first pay civil fines and court fees before registering to vote.

Democrats seek to transform Florida’s current voter map of 4.96 million registered Democrats, 4.7 million Republicans and about 3.6 million voters with no declared party affiliation.

Failed gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum announced his own Florida voter registration initiative committed to registering no less than one million new voters for 2020 while aiming to “evict Donald Trump” from the White House.

“We are going to commit ourselves to registering and engaging one million voters between now and 2020’s presidential election,” Gillum said last month in Miami, addressing his new group which calls itself Bring It Home Florida.

“The road to the White House runs through Florida,” added Gillum. “We can deny Donald Trump a second term right here in the state of Florida.”

“How many states can you say, by themselves, have the ability to deny this man a return to the White House?” Gillum asked. “I can’t think of a bigger, better, more important state than the state of Florida, than for us to send that message.”

Billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is reportedly putting capital into voter turnout and registration efforts in Florida and other swing states.

Mitch Stewart, a Bloomberg adviser who headed Barack Obama’s 2012 battleground strategy, told Politico:

As we looked at the gaps in the current ecosystem, we said, ‘Could we set something up right now that could provide the infrastructure, provide the data and technology to whomever the eventually nominee is so they’re not at such a disadvantage once the primary is over?’ We can.

The Florida Democratic Party itself is reportedly planning to spend at least $2 million to register new voters. The party is seeking to hire full-time organizers and utilize the services of data science firms in their Florida efforts, Politico reported.

Juan Peñalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, said the party would work with Gillum on the drive to flip Florida. “As one of the more exciting leaders of our Party in Florida, we’re excited for Andrew Gillum to direct his energies toward registering voters and we are working closely with Mayor Gillum to ensure we meet aggressive goals to bring more Floridians into the democratic process,” Peñalosa said.

Gillum is leading Democratic efforts focused on implementing Amendment 4, a state constitutional amendment that restores voting options for ex-felons. The Florida Legislature has been debating legislation that would require ex-felons to first pay their court costs and associated fines.

Writing at the Tampa Bay Times on Wednesday, Gillum argued that the legislation seeks to disenfranchise voters.

Gillum opined:

While supervisors of elections all across our state opened the rolls to ex-felons almost immediately, lawmakers moved swiftly to prevent our newly redeemed citizens from participating in democracy. They’ve resorted to the same tactics implemented in 1885 by Florida neo-confederates scared of the future and social equality — a poll tax. And make no mistake, that poll tax was effective in preventing minorities from participating in democracy and enriching our state for generations — and this one would be effective, too. By requiring full monetary restitution to be paid before civil rights are restored, lawmakers would be unconstitutionally burdening reformed ex-felons attempting to participate in our society.

Gillum is acting in lockstep with efforts of major U.S. progressive organizations collectively aiding the drive to register ex-felons in Florida.

The heavily Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.) argued that legislation seeking to ensure ex-felons pay their court fines before regaining voting rights “places unconstitutional restrictions on the eligibility to vote for individuals who should have their voting rights back.”

The A.C.L.U. acted as a consultant in drafting Florida’s Amendment 4 on ex-felons together with the Soros-financed Brennan Center for Justice based in New York.

Soros’s Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the A.C.L.U. The Brennan Center has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010 alone.

Gillum has been closely associated with likeminded progressive groups.

Breitbart News previously reported Gillum served as the director of a radical youth training organization whose mission was to challenge U.S. “predatory capitalism,” abolish the prison system, fight a “spiritual resistance” battle against “Christian hegemony,” redefine the meaning of “borders” while aiding “undocumented” aliens, and enact the “collective liberation” of “communities of color” amid what it described as the scourge of “white supremacy.”

Gillum’s group accused the U.S. of being a “colonialist” power perpetrating “structural violence” and “continued genocide.” It claimed conservatives in the U.S. judicial system were “justifying white supremacist policing practices.”

All of that extremist rhetoric and more was posted on the official “issues” sections of the organization’s website while Gillum not only served as its active director, but while his picture, position and bio were brandished on the same site on the “staff” page.

The organization in question is Young People For, or YP4, one of two youth training groups that Gillum directed and oversaw while he worked at the George Soros-financed People for the American Way, or PFAW, as field organizer in 2002 and then Director of Youth Leadership Programs from 2005 until January 13, 2017. He departed PFAW just ahead of his gubernatorial run.

Also, Breitbart News reported Gillum graduated from an Oakland, California-based training school for progressive revolutionaries that has spawned a list of activists who have gone on to become the who’s who of the far-left leadership world, with many taking senior positions at organizations financed by Soros.

In scores of cases, graduates of the Rockwood Leadership Institute founded or directed notorious Soros-financed activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org and the Tides Foundation, one of the nation’s largest funders of progressive groups.

Bangor City Council are faced with a shortfall of nearly £600,000 for essential restoration work on Garth Pier.

The restoration work commenced in August 2017 and the council have spent £1.3million on the work, money which they already had in reserve for the project.

Detailed incremental surveys undertaken last year revealed more challenging problems and the extent of the metal decay. The survey showed that trusses supporting the end of the pier were so weak and corroded there was a real risk of the pier collapsing, this resulted in the pierhead closing to the public in June 2018 due to health and safety reasons.

New steel trusses and supports have now replaced the decayed and weak areas, with 69 out of 75 trusses being replaced, which has proved expensive both in terms of labour, time and metal.

Scaffolding is still up on the end of the pier and is likely to remain it place as it would be very costly to take it down and rebuild it at a later stage, a cost the council is keen to avoid.

The unforeseen work on the pier means the extra cash is now needed in order to finish the restoration and the council are now considering ‘all options’ in order to raise the cash.

An application for funding to the Heritage Lottery Fund was rejected in 2014/15 and a new application – which would cost thousands in expert help to put together – would not give any guarantee of success. Other ideas include applying for finical help from historical monuments body Cadw or support from the Welsh Government.

Bangor Mayor John Wyn Jones said: “There’s nothing that’s not in our minds… We’re even thinking about crowdfunding.” Although Mr Jones added that “ratepayers had footed their share of the bill over the years, so the council did not want to impose any charges on people in the city.”

The Pierhead will remain closed to the public until it is deemed not to be a construction site and the pavilion will be rebuilt, with access anticipated being available to the public in June/July 2019.

Pier History

Garth Pier opened in 1896 is a Grade II listed structure and at 460m in length, it is the second-longest pier in Wales, and the ninth longest in the British Isles.

In 1971, the pier closed on safety grounds, with ownership being passed to Arfon Borough Council in 1974. The council took the immediate decision to demolish the pier, but Bangor City Council objected, obtaining a Grade II listing for the structure, with the planning officer considering it one of the three finest surviving piers in Great Britain.

Bangor City Council purchased the pier for a nominal fee of 1p in 1975, and restoration began in 1982 taking until 1988 to complete. Financial assistance was given from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Welsh Office and Manpower Services Commission. The pier was reopened on 7 May 1988.

Fantastic Pier

Garth councillor Huw Wyn Jones said: “It’s a fantastic pier and fantastic location. It’s probably the best Victorian pier left in Wales.

“You only need to look at Colwyn Bay pier just up the coast, 25 miles away, where maintenance wasn’t done and it fell into the sea.

“Unfortunately that’s what happens with piers if you don’t maintain them – for me, that makes it even more important that we look after this one and make sure it’s here for generations to enjoy in the future.”

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — A dispute between two major California water agencies is threatening to derail a hard-won agreement designed to protect a river that serves 40 million people in the U.S. West.

The Imperial Irrigation District, the largest single recipient of Colorado River water, on Tuesday sued a Los Angeles water utility that agreed to contribute most of California’s share of water to a key reservoir under a multistate drought contingency plan.

The action came the same day President Donald Trump approved federal legislation to implement the plan, which Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming spent years negotiating.

The agreement is meant to keep the country’s two largest reservoirs on the Colorado River from dropping so low they cannot deliver water or produce hydropower amid prolonged drought and climate change.

The Imperial Irrigation District said it wouldn’t join the drought plan unless it secured $200 million in federal funding to address health and environmental hazards at the Salton Sea, a massive, briny lake southeast of Los Angeles.

The Metropolitan Water District, which serves Los Angeles, essentially wrote Imperial out of the drought plan to prevent delays in implementing it. It took on the amount of water that Imperial pledged to contribute to Lake Mead. With that, Metropolitan’s contribution could top 2 million acre-feet through 2026 when the drought plan expires. An acre-foot is enough water to serve one to two average households a year.

Imperial’s lawsuit claims the Metropolitan Water District sidestepped an environmental law.

“Where the water supply would come from and what environmental impacts could result from Metropolitan’s need to acquire such water to fill this sizable hole in its water supply are entirely unknown,” Imperial wrote in court documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.

A California law requires state and local agencies to identify any potential environmental effects of their actions and address them if possible. Imperial is asking the court to force Metropolitan to comply with that law, which could delay the larger drought plan from being implemented.

Metropolitan has said storing water in Lake Mead under the drought plan doesn’t require review under the California Environmental Quality Act because any changes to its facilities would be minor.

“We are disappointed that the Imperial Irrigation District is using litigation as a tool to block implementation of the drought contingency plan,” Metropolitan general manager Jeff Kightlinger said in a statement Wednesday. “Parties on the Colorado River need to collaborate during this time of crisis, not litigate.”

Imperial took the stance in December that the drought plan would be exempt from the environmental law. District spokesman Robert Schettler said Wednesday that came before Metropolitan strayed from a version that Imperial approved with stipulations.

The seven states and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have said the drought plan won’t affect the Salton Sea, but the Imperial Irrigation District isn’t convinced.

“The logic in going forward without IID was that the DCP (drought contingency plan) couldn’t wait for the Salton Sea,” general manager Henry Martinez said Wednesday. “This legal challenge is going to put that logic to the test, and the focus will now be where it should have been all along, the Salton Sea.”

Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said it’s unclear what would happen if a California judge sides with Imperial and prohibits the Metropolitan Water District from signing final documents for the drought plan.

“We certainly will have to have some conversations among the basin states and Reclamation on how to move forward and what we can or can’t do at that point in time,” he told reporters in Phoenix.

The states were expected to sign final documents next month in line with a timeframe for Mexico also to begin contributing water next year, Bureau of Reclamation spokeswoman Patti Aaron said. She said the agency is reviewing the lawsuit for its potential effects but declined to comment on it.

Put Aside Your Purity Politics and Embrace My Feckless Centrism

As the 2020 presidential election draws closer, it’s more important than ever for Democrats to put aside their differences to unite around my feckless centrist candidate. We must remember that this is simply not the time to discuss and debate the merits of each candidate to arrive at a popular consensus pick. That sort of “primarying” isn’t helpful in a primary election, as it will only result in the most popular candidate winning the nomination, which isn’t my feckless centrist.

You might think that the candidate voters select is self-evidently the best candidate to win the general, as they have already proven they have some sort of popular support. But what really wins elections is “electability.” Electability is a perfect metric I invented that rejects flawed models like polling data and past election results and favors the views of myself and other wealthy, white op-ed columnists. Yes, Bernie Sanders consistently polls as the most popular running Democrat, but that’s because most voters don’t understand that he’s not who most voters want. If you want to win elections, you have to listen to me. I know my stuff — you don’t get to where I am without graduating from Rich Kid Legacy Admissions University, interning at the Koch Brothers Institute for Promoting the Agenda of the Koch Brothers, and consulting for several prominent losing candidates.

Sure, it’d be nice to have a leftist in the Oval Office, but in the real world, an extremist wouldn’t stand a chance at becoming president. The American people like moderates. Just ask Jeb Bush, who cruised his way to an easy victory in the 2016 election. It’s what decades of behavioral science has told us — people are perfectly rational animals driven by an innate desire for compromise. It’s why sports fans cheer for good, clean play and games that end in ties. It’s why cereal commercials always have nutritional data front and center, while a voiceover calmly explains the cereal’s pros and cons. Voters don’t want someone championing radical policies that would directly improve their lives. They want a feckless centrist who’s only willing to sputter out vague platitudes for fear of alienating oil executives and white supremacists. That’s the feckless centrism that contributes to the proud American tradition of having one of the lowest voter turnouts among developed democracies!

You need to accept that we both want progress. I want Medicare For All (in a very limited form that will still let me sell prescription drugs at five hundred times the cost) and a Green New Deal (hopefully long after I’m dead and my children have secured their place in their hermetically-sealed bunker). The fact is, you can’t have progress too quickly. Progress doesn’t work like a nuclear bomb that goes off suddenly and changes the world overnight, like when we bombed Hiroshima and eighty thousand people died instantaneously. Real change, lasting change, happens in incremental steps over time. You know how when we bombed Hiroshima, thousands of civilians didn’t die outright, but rather, they were poisoned by radiation, causing constant and severe nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting over the course of a few agonizing, painful weeks, until all of their blood cells deteriorated and their bodies emaciated and died? That’s what progress looks like!

We’re fighting Donald Trump, people! Do you think a steady moral compass and ideological purity is going to beat back the rising tides of American fascism? No! It’s feckless centrism and incremental changes! Think back to how we stopped the Nazis — the Allies compromised with Hitler and allowed him to just do less of the Holocaust, incrementally scaling back on the genocide. And by 2002, all the concentration camps were closed and repurposed as Web 1.0 startups!

I understand that committing to this feckless centrism isn’t going to be easy. You’re going to hear a lot of purity political talking points this election cycle, like “we must do everything we can to fight climate change,” or “the electoral college doesn’t represent the will of the people and is inherently undemocratic,” or even, “it is morally wrong to put human children in cages.” You might even start to believe these things and imagine that a better world is possible. But just remember the lessons taught to us from all our favorite stories. The hero, when faced with incredible odds, looks deep within herself, musters all her remaining strength, and compromises.
WASHINGTON — Not all of Robert S. Mueller III’s findings will be news to President Trump when they are released Thursday.

Justice Department officials have had numerous conversations with White House lawyers about the conclusions made by Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, in recent days, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The talks have aided the president’s legal team as it prepares a rebuttal to the report and strategizes for the coming public war over its findings.

A sense of paranoia was taking hold among some of Mr. Trump’s aides, some of whom fear his backlash more than the findings themselves, the people said. The report might make clear which of Mr. Trump’s current and former advisers spoke to the special counsel, how much they said and how much damage they did to the president — providing a kind of road map for retaliation.

The discussions between Justice Department officials and White House lawyers have also added to questions about the propriety of the decisions by Attorney General William P. Barr since he received Mr. Mueller’s findings late last month.
A handful of Democratic candidates for president have released at least 10 years of federal tax returns in an effort to promote transparency and create a contrast with President Donald Trump, who's refused to release his returns both as a candidate and as president.

Here are some of the notable takeaways from the new financial data of Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke:

What they're earning

One of the most apparent takeaways from a candidates' tax documents is how much they're making each year.

All the candidates reported making more than $200,000, filed jointly with their spouses, in adjusted gross income in 2018, putting them substantially above an average American's earnings, ranging from Harris, ($1.9 million) and Warren ($846,394), to Inslee ($202,912).

Of the seven 2020 candidates to release returns, at least three are millionaires: Sanders, Warren and Harris.

Sanders, famous for his campaign against the unjust power of the richest 1%, reported an adjusted gross income of $1.06 million in 2016 and $1.13 million in 2017. The bump in income those years was more than four times his income from a year earlier because of his bestselling 2016 book, "Our Revolution."

The senator, who joked before the release of his returns that if someone else wrote a bestselling book they, too, could be a millionaire, later said he was "grateful" for the financial success and that it marked a sharp contrast to his upbringing in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.

Warren, who's also made anti-corruption a key focus of her campaign, is also part of the 1%, the documents show. Her adjusted gross income in 2018, after filing jointly with her husband, exceeded $846,000. Between 2013 and 2015, her adjusted gross income was over $1 million and neared $1.55 million in 2014 after her first book was released.

Harris reported the highest 2018 gross income at $1.89 million. Her husband, an attorney whom she married in 2014, earned most of their income. For 2018, Harris reported just over $157,000 in Senate salary and $320,125 in profits from the book she authored ahead of her campaign announcement.

Gillibrand reported $214,083 in adjusted gross income for 2018 and Klobuchar reported $338,121. O'Rourke has yet to submit his 2018 returns, but reported $366,455 for 2017.

How much are they giving to charity?

The most generous candidate in 2018, according to candidates' tax returns, was Warren. She and her husband gave $50,128 to charity, almost 6% of her household adjusted gross income for the year.

Next up was Inslee, who donated about 4% of his and his wife's income, or about $8,300.

In comparison to other Americans with similar adjusted gross incomes, Warren donated about twice the average percentage -- which is about 2.7% for an income between $500,000 and $1 million, the latest IRS figures show. Inslee, who reported earning nearly $203,000 in 2018, donated about one and a half times more than the average percentage for someone of the same income.

Sanders and his wife gave about 3.3% of their income to charity over the past two years. They gave $18,950 in 2018 and $36,300 in 2017. The couple also donated the proceeds of one of the senator's books, "The Speech," though the donations did not appear on their tax returns, according to the campaign. The donations have gone primarily to "senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities and environmental and housing advocacy groups," the campaign said.

Sanders donated about the same as the average for similar income, according to IRS figures.

Klobuchar and Gillibrand donated about 2% of their adjusted gross income in 2018, coming to nearly $6,600 for Klobuchar and $3,750 for Gillibrand. Klobuchar and Gillibrand's donations also match up with the average percentage that people at those income levels donate, IRS figures show.

O'Rourke appeared to give the smallest percentage of his family's income to charity in 2017 -- a total of $1,166, or 0.3%, which falls below the average percent donated by someone of his income level, while Harris and her husband donated $27,000, about 1.4% -- less than half of what the average is for similar adjusted gross incomes, according to IRS data.

On average, those who earn between $1.5 million and $2 million donate around 3.4% of their income to charity, the latest IRS figures show.

Roughly half of all charitable donations come from households with annual incomes of at least $100,000, IRS figures show, but the percentage doesn't usually skyrocket as wealth increases. For example, while the average donation for an income bracket between $500,000 and $1 million is 2%, the average donation for those who earn at least 10-20 times more money, $10 million a year or more, is around 10.4%.

"The thing that's really shocking is, as incomes go up, people's propensity to give doesn't grow proportionally," said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Project. Burman tracked the donations by candidates in the 2012 election and found some, like former President Barack Obama and candidate Mitt Romney, gave around 14% of their income to charity, while candidates like Newt Gingrich gave around 2.6%.

"If you're well off, you probably have an obligation to share with people who are needy," Burman said.

Charitable donations can be tracked only after candidates release their returns, a tradition that has continued since former President Richard Nixon was in office -- but some point out that none of this information, which is often scrutinized, is required to be provided by law.

"If the biggest complaint [voters] can have from all these returns is whether ... the candidate is charitable enough, then this is a victory for all these candidates," Tony Nitti, a CPA and partner at Rubin Brown LLP, told ABC News.

"The fact that you have the transparency allows us to go through this exercise, so we know that there's nothing to worry about," Nitti said.

How much of their income is paid in taxes?

The Democrats who released their returns all appear to be paying their fair share of taxes given their income, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute.

"None of these folks are seemingly cheating or getting away with anything," he told ABC News after reviewing the returns made public by the campaigns.

Harris and her husband, earning about $1.9 million, paid at an effective tax rate of 37%, the highest among candidates who've disclosed returns. Gillibrand, who reported earning $214,083, had an effective tax rate of 14%, according to her returns.

Sanders, who released 10 years of returns Monday, had an effective federal tax rate of 26% in 2018, paying $145,840 in federal taxes on adjusted gross income of $561,293.

Warren, with an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018, paid 27%.

With an adjusted gross income of $366,455 in 2017, O'Rourke had an effective tax rate of 22%.

Klobuchar, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $338,121, and Inslee, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $202,912, round out the list with some of the lowest tax rates of 19% and 15%, respectively.

"There are often complaints that rich people are able to take lots of loopholes," Edwards said, referencing billionaire Warren Buffett's often-cited comments that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. "None of these candidates seem to be as lucky as Warren Buffett. They are paying tax rates as high as people with similar incomes."

While little is known about the president's returns, The New York Times reported last year that the president and his siblings allegedly used fake corporations to hide money received from their parents to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes.

The White House called The Times report a "misleading attack against the Trump family" and claimed the IRS signed off on the transactions detailed in the report.

Keep in mind: Most Democrats (as well as the president) have yet to release their returns

While five candidates have released years of tax returns, most among the nearly 20 Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have yet to do so.

The president has refused to release his, and the White House vows he likely won't.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush set the record for tax information released by a presidential candidate in 2016 by disclosing 33 years of returns.

The early disclosures, more than a year away from the election, are significant and represent a "shift" in the Democratic Party, Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told ABC News.

"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why," he said.
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea said on Thursday it no longer wanted to deal with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and that he should be replaced in talks by someone more mature, hours after it announced its first weapons test since nuclear talks broke down.

North Korea’s state news agency said Kwon Jong Gun, in charge of U.S. affairs at the foreign ministry, had warned that no one could predict what would happen if Washington did not abandon the “root cause” that compelled Pyongyang to develop nuclear weapons.

The statement came shortly after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test of a new tactical guided weapon, North Korea’s first weapon test since a summit between him and Trump broke down in late February.

U.S. officials appeared to play down both developments, with acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan telling reporters at the Pentagon that while there had been a test, it was “not a ballistic missile.”

A spokeswoman for the State Department said it was aware of the report about Pompeo and added: “The United States remains ready to engage North Korea in a constructive negotiation.”

Despite the summit breakdown, North Korea had maintained a freeze in nuclear and ballistic missile testing in place since 2017,and Trump has repeatedly pointed to that as an important outcome from a year of engagement with Pyongyang.

Experts said the North Korean moves appeared aimed at dividing Trump from senior officials in the hope of exacting concessions, particularly relief from punishing sanctions.

“Just as this week’s ‘tactical weapon’ test was a signal to warn Trump that his much-vaunted ‘freeze’ is in jeopardy, the verbal attack on Pompeo is meant to encourage Trump to ignore his hardline advisers and make a deal with his ‘friend’ Kim Jong Un,” said Daniel Russel, the top U.S diplomat for East Asia until early in Trump’s administration.

“As long as the North Koreans believe they can flatter and dupe the U.S. president into making important concessions ... they will resist dealing with less gullible and more demanding subordinate U.S. officials.”

KCNA gave no details on the weapon that was tested, but “tactical” implied a short-range weapon rather than the ballistic missiles seen as a threat to the United States.

Kim Dong-yub, a military expert at Seoul’s Kyungnam University, said it was likely a short-range cruise missile.

KCNA quoted Kwon as saying that the February summit in Hanoi, the second between the two leaders, showed talks could go wrong “whenever Pompeo pokes his nose in.”

“I am afraid that, if Pompeo engages in the talks again, the table will be lousy once again and the talks will become entangled,” Kwon said.

‘MORE CAREFUL AND MATURE’

“Therefore, even in the case of possible resumption of the dialogue with the United States, I wish our dialogue counterpart would be not Pompeo but other person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us,” Kwon added.

Joseph Yun, who served as U.S. special representative for North Korea until last year, said North Korea had long been dubious about Pompeo, seeing him as a hardline conservative skeptical of engagement with North Korea.

He said that while Kwon would have been acting on the highest authority, he was only a mid-level official, so his statements should be “taken with a pinch of salt.”

“Pompeo is not frozen out as long as Trump wants him to do the job, and the North Koreans have to live with that,” Yun added.

Kim warned last week that the Hanoi breakdown risked reviving tensions and said he was only interested in meeting Trump again if Washington showed more flexibility. He gave a year-end deadline for a change in attitude. [nL3N21U4FK]

Trump has said he is open to another summit with Kim, but his national security adviser, John Bolton, told Bloomberg News on Wednesday there first needed to be “a real indication from North Korea that they’ve made the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons.”

Despite the summit failure, Kim and Trump have both stressed their good personal relationship, and Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists saw North Korea’s recent statements as “its latest play .. to sideline U.S. officials to try to speak directly to the president.”

“The Trump administration has generally chosen to ignore Pyongyang’s public signals, including escalating signals of displeasure with the negotiations,” he said. “So far, North Korea has not walked away from the table, but they also have resisted pressure to make substantive progress on the nuclear question.”

Kwon also said the two leaders were on good terms, even as he castigated Pompeo for “fabricated” stories as part of a “publicity stunt.” He did not elaborate.

Kwon said Pompeo had made “reckless remarks hurting the dignity of our supreme leadership,” apparently referring to his agreeing to the characterization of Kim as a “tyrant” at a U.S. congressional hearing last week.

Kim oversaw the test of an unidentified tactical weapon in November.

He said last April he would stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles because North Korea’s nuclear capabilities had been verified, but he has never promised to stop testing all weapons.

Kim’s visit to the testing site came after he visited the North Korean Air and Anti-aircraft Force on Tuesday.
The reverberations of Alexisonfire’s influence drip through almost every inch of modern heavy music.

It’s fair to say the world hasn’t spun on its axis quite right since the chorus of ‘Boiled Frogs’ reigned with a vengeance over a clergy of faithful worshippers, hungry for the wisdom spat by the mighty Dallas Green. Faces haven’t been melted quite as effectively since the spattering lead lines that cradled their excellent second record Watch Out!

In 2015, the band announced their return onto the live circuit. Alexisonfire’s die-hard fanbase were sent into disarray, relishing the thought of witnessing the monolithic clan of musicians once again. Australia was treated to the band’s prowess in early 2017, with the band making their way to the mecca of heavy music itself, Unify Gathering.

Alexisonfire – ‘Young Cardinals’ Live at Unify Gathering 2017

“I feel like in Australia we kinda stick to the major cities and it was cool to get out into the country a bit and I didn’t know this was just sort of spectacular. We had so much fun, that was a really positive tour. It just was a great time in Australia, it’s my favourite place to tour,” said historically ferocious screamer George Pettit, reminiscing on the band’s 2017 return to Australia, a constant hub of love and adoration for the legendary act.

Earlier this year, excitement bubbled in the Alexisonfire camp as the band geared up to release their first single in nine years, ‘Familiar Drugs’.

Like all rock bangers, the song was birthed out a rollicking, driving and almost forgotten riff.

“I had almost no recollection of the track. It was Dallas that came with it and it wasn’t necessarily the track, it was like this riff. The story that Dallas told me was that he found an old phone in one of his drawers and he plugged it in and he was going through the voice notes and there was a guitar riff. He was like..”Oh yeah. Yeah. That’s a good one. Let me play that”.

“When we do get together it is productive. ‘Familiar Drugs’ is the first offering birthed from this.”

It’s kind of got stuck in his head and he just kept playing it, and then we started playing shows and we have to do sound checks and after soundcheck, we’re all standing around all of our instruments. It’s the obvious thing and Dallas starts playing the riff and Wade, has a sister riff to that riff. That’s where the elements were put together and it just kind of rolls from there and that’s kind of how Alexisonfire writes music.”

‘Familiar Drugs’ leans into the band’s strengths in every which way without having to rely on old tricks. It folds and rolls with groovy and mysterious emotion in every crevice. Dissonance drenches the off-kilter chorus that only provides some ease to the tension built in the bluesy verses. It’s built for arenas and festival mainstages, where the band belongs.

“We don’t have all the time that we used to where we could just play. We don’t really have the luxury of that scheduling any more studio time, so that’s kind of how things have been going lately. When we do get together it is productive. ‘Familiar Drugs’ is the first offering birthed from this.”

Alexisonfire – ‘Familiar Drugs’

With nostalgia and throwback, nights permeated the pop culture mindset of late, Alexisonfire as a collective, felt the need to establish a new era with ‘Familiar Drugs’. After three years of playing shows, it was time to silence naysayers who may have gathered the idea that the band were back to ride on the success of their legacy.

“We’ve done a few years of just playing shows and I think we all enjoyed that. We were all still really enjoying being around each other and at some point it just felt like OK well if we’re gonna continue to play shows.

We don’t want to become this nostalgia act just playing the show that plays the hits and I mean, as much as that is very fun to do, you want to feel like you’re a current band.I thought I still really enjoyed playing the songs from the old records. You want to feel like you’re capable of making music again.”

Even Pettit admits to feeling both excitement and disappointment towards his own favourite bands who continue to ride off the hype of yesteryear, noting that he hopes Alexisonfire doesn’t fall into the same category.

“I’ve been there and I appreciate the bands that come back. I’ve seen the bands that come back and to accept the festival slot and then I go on and see them and I’m so excited about it, and it’s just not what it was it’s just purely a nostalgia sort of thing. But adversely I’ve also seen the band that comes back and it’s the greatest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

“It’s so fun to reminisce of what was but at the same time, I am feeling quite current”

So I’m hoping we can provide that experience as opposed to the latter. I just don’t want to become that band the band that shows up, you know give the crowd what they want with hear the hits and then moves on.”

In the early 2000s, Alexisonfire shot to the heights of post-hardcore fame, maintaining their status as scene leaders for over a decade. Their self titled debut distilled the schizophrenics of 80s skramz with the agression and power of pummelling hardcore, whilst Watch Out! refined the formula to a catchy, Warped Tour-friendly product, placing them amongst genre heroes like Thrice and Thursday. Crisis is undeniably one of the greatest rock albums of the decade and Young Cardinals is pure anthemic gold.

However, despite years of total musical excellence and adoration, Pettit is more excited for the future than ever – looking back can be fun, but the magic captured by the Canadian clan doesn’t just die out

“I don’t know it makes me feel uncomfortable to use the word legacy. But I guess that’s it. I like to look back positively on my time that we spent like you know slugging it out. You know everybody sits around and tells stories about you know the time we woke up in a van on the side of the highway, in the desert and almost got baked alive.”

It’s so fun to reminisce of what was but at the same time, I am feeling quite current. I feel like I’m excited about what’s next. You know I’m almost more excited about what’s next and then to sit back and think about the past…that’s kind of where I’m at right now.”

Alexisonfire – ‘No Transitory’

Although ‘Familiar Drugs’ was released as a stand alone single, according to Pettit, releasing new music is at the forefront of the band’s mind.

“As of right now like, there’s in the stuff on the banks, every time we get together we write stuff. There’s a lot of music written. I’ll say that and there’s going to be more music coming out. Probably sooner than later. We don’t have any hard dates on anything. But yeah, you know there’s got to be more music that’s really all I can really tell you.

Whether that’s an EP or single or an album, time will tell. But as of right now, I can promise you there will be more music but I don’t know what shape or form it’s going to be.”

With a legacy that spans generations, and a fresh spark and undying energy, Alexisonfire are still rock renegades. They’re lifers, who’ll continue to fight the good fight, and gather those who need a fearless leader.

“Guitar based music has always been there. It just might not be on the television. It might not be on the radio, but that’s good. The best of our culture happens in 200 capacity clubs, happens at independent record stores and so when like you hear someone like, you know the singer of Maroon 5 say nothing’s happening in rock music it doesn’t make sense.”

Punk music is still very much alive. Fucking you know, Metal is still very much alive. It could be anywhere. Just it just might be just might not be you know easily accessible.”

One of the most frustrating things about Republicans these days is their shameless hypocrisy, which is often rooted in projection. Their concocted criticisms of Democrats are almost always versions of things that they have done in the past, or know they will do in the future if they are in power.

No one does shameless hypocrisy better than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. After adopting a strategy of total obstruction during the first six years of Obama’s presidency, he has been the one accusing Democrats of being the obstructionists lately. A few weeks ago, when he thought that Democrats were dragging out the process for approving presidential nominees, McConnell actually said, “this is new, and it needs to stop…This systematic obstruction is unfair to our duly elected president.”

How devoid of a conscience do you need to be in order to deny a sitting president a hearing on his Supreme Court nominee and then turn around less than three years later and suggest that Democrats dragging their feet is something new that is “unfair to our duly elected president?” You’d have to be a sociopath to avoid hearing that as anything but mind-boggling.

My favorite example of Republican hypocrisy is evangelical Christians who, in order to justify their support for a serial liar and adulterer, claim that God is in control and uses imperfect humans to enact his agenda. I can only assume that God took a break from being in control during the Obama presidency, because he was demonized by many of these same people on a daily basis.

That brings us to a remarkable compilation by NowThis demonstrating the unique brand of hypocrisy practiced by the propaganda network known as Fox News.

What if Fox News covered Trump the way it covered Obama? It would look like this pic.twitter.com/dLfhHToieL — NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 16, 2019

I hope you can take a couple of minutes to watch that because, as with most art forms, to explain it is to rob it of its punch. Those clips hit home because we all witnessed how Fox News pivoted 180 degrees during the transition from Obama’s presidency to Trump’s. The hypocrisy couldn’t be more blatant.

The truth is that this kind of hypocrisy is just another form of propaganda that we should add to the list. To the extent that our minds are boggled, that is probably the point. As a Twitter user with the handle Darth Putin wrote: “We don’t do propaganda so you believe something. We do it so you believe nothing. And more importantly, do nothing.”
Kamala Harris has generated interest among many of the most wealthy and connected campaign supporters in the country, receiving donations from more than twice as many top Democratic fundraisers as her next closest competitor. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo 2020 elections Kamala Harris takes early lead in the big-money race Harris got early support from 176 big Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama fundraisers, more than twice as many as the next 2020 candidate.

Hundreds of the biggest Democratic fundraisers in the past two presidential elections are already picking candidates for 2020 — and Kamala Harris has a significant early edge, while Pete Buttigieg and his from-scratch campaign has scrambled into the second tier.

Harris has already received donations from 176 people or couples who raised at least $100,000, and sometimes many multiples of that, for Hillary Clinton in 2016 or at least $50,000 for Barack Obama in 2012, according to a POLITICO analysis of new campaign finance disclosures and “bundler” data from the Center for Responsive Politics. While the Democratic presidential campaigns have been focused on building small-donor armies this year, bundlers mine their networks for checks to pass along to campaigns six or seven-figures at a time, giving them a potentially massive role in a crowded primary.

Story Continued Below

Donations from these key fundraisers signal the out-of-the-gate interest the candidates are generating among many of the most wealthy and connected campaign supporters in the country. And while candidates have taken a more muted approach to raising checks from wealthy supporters this cycle as they seek to prove they have grassroots support online, they still benefit greatly big-donor support — and most are pursuing it seriously. Clinton and Obama’s bundlers raised hundreds of millions of dollars for their presidential campaigns, helped rally supporters to their cause, and participated in campaigns as surrogates and volunteers.

“It’s about whether you’re willing to get your hands dirty,” said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. “Writing the check is not good enough — [campaigns] need people to work their networks” to build a national machine of donors and volunteers to give them life, Gifford said.

Harris has received donations from more than twice as many top Democratic fundraisers as her next closest competitor, Cory Booker, who got donations from 80 Obama and Clinton bundlers in the first quarter, according to POLITICO’s review of campaign finance reports. The network helped Harris post the second-best fundraising total of any Democratic presidential candidate in the first quarter, $12 million — most of which came from donors who gave at least $200 each. Larger donors also accounted for more than 80 percent of the $5 million Booker raised early this year.

Kirsten Gillibrand (67 bundlers) and Amy Klobuchar (61) also picked up pieces of the Obama and Clinton networks. But the longtime senators were closely followed by a rising candidate, Buttigieg, who got backing from 51 bundlers, despite having few fundraising connections before his campaign caught fire in March — prompting a wave of small donors to flock to his campaign, too.

Mel Heifetz, a Philadelphia-based real estate developer and philanthropist who raised money for Clinton’s campaign and donated $1 million each to super PACs supporting Obama and Clinton, donated to several candidates with whom he had existing relationships this year. Then Buttegieg caught his attention.

Heifetz received a call from Buttegieg’s husband, Chasten, after donating to the campaign and has now met with Pete Buttegieg as well. And Heifetz told POLITICO that he would spend $5 million to aid Buttegieg if he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee.

“The fact that he’s gay and is being accepted is unbelievable,” said Heifetz, who is himself gay and supports LGBTQ causes. “If it had been a straight candidate with his credentials and his background I would have supported him anyway.”

The field of experienced bundlers is still wide open for every candidate: Almost 4 in 5 of the Obama and Clinton fundraisers have yet to give any significant donations in the 2020 presidential race, partially because of candidates’ hesitancy to go all-out courting big money and partially because many donors want to bide their time before picking a candidate out of a crowded field. Some donors — including powerful fundraisers for Obama — are waiting to see if former Vice President Joe Biden decides to run before deciding where their loyalties lie.

While Buttegieg had built relationships with Democrats during his run for national party chair in 2017, he was still largely unknown to most Democratic donors prior to his surge in popularity this spring. His campaign is taking an “inclusive” model of reaching out to new and old party donors, campaign spokesperson Lis Smith said, encouraging donors to do outreach and fundraising of their own even if they haven’t done it before.

The donor support “tells you that people not only believe this is worth supporting, but that it has the staying power and seriousness that deserves that kind of investment,” Buttegieg said in an interview.

Some early bundler money is going in multiple directions. Minnesota businessman Bob Pohlad, who with his wife, Michelle, bundled money for Obama and Clinton, donated to both Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke’s campaigns before giving money to Buttigieg.

In an interview, Pohlad said he did not know who Buttegieg was prior to his 2019 campaign and initially was impressed by his CNN town hall. He now plans to hold a small fundraiser for him during an upcoming visit to St. Paul.

Pohlad said he’s clear-eyed that Buttegieg is a somewhat improbable nominee — but he said he’s been taken in by his “message of inclusivity and reasonableness.”

“I could be his dad. I have kids Pete’s age,” Pohlad said. “But if he continues to be the way he has shown himself to be in terms of character, in terms of ideas and in terms of tone of approach, I will support him for as long as he’s in the race.”

Unlike Pohlad, a majority of fundraisers have yet to give a donation to any candidate.

POLITICO analyzed 1,924 individuals and couples whose names were on bundler lists released by the Clinton campaign in 2016 and the Obama campaign in 2012. Only 425 had made a donation to one or more candidates thus far in this presidential election cycle. The analysis included itemized donations of $200 or more that are recorded by the Federal Election Commission.

Harris, who has won statewide elections three times in California, home to many of the country’s most prolific donors, was well-positioned to seize support from many top fundraisers. Her campaign worked overtime to court wealthy supporters this spring, especially in California, at a moment when many Democrats are hesitant to be seen with rich backers.

“I’ll do anything I can do to help her campaign. She’s my No. 1,” said Kelly Dermody, a San Francisco-based employment lawyer who, spurred by concerns about Trump’s rise, raised more than $100,000 for Clinton in 2016. “I like where she’s going and what she stands for. If I’m able to take weekends away to do retail politics and roll up my sleeves, I will do that too.”

And fewer than half of the bundlers who gave to Harris — 81 of 176 — were based in California, according to campaign finance records, a sign her support extended beyond her home state.

Of the leading candidates for president, Bernie Sanders drew the least support from Clinton and Obama’s elite fundraisers: He received donations from only two of them — one fewer than self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Elizabeth Warren, who has sworn off closed-door fundraisers in the presidential primary, received donations from 18 people who raised big money for Clinton or Obama.

Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee each received support from 25 of the top Democratic fundraisers, while Beto O’Rourke — whose 2018 Texas Senate campaign was fueled by record online donations — had 38 bundlers on his first-quarter donor rolls.

In past years, some candidates publicized fundraisers and touted their bundlers alongside their grassroots supporters as signs they were running formidable campaigns. But fundraising among Democratic candidates for president has been muffled so far this year, as many Democrats try to prove their distance from special interests and wealthy donors, instead leaning on online small-dollar fundraising for support.

For many candidates, that approach may have its limits — which were reflected in the first-quarter fundraising reports, cautioned Gifford, Obama’s former finance director.

“The campaigns need to understand that email giving is not the be-all and end-all. And we’ve seen that in the campaign fundraising numbers. This is about working it, it’s about working relationships, it’s about talking to people,” Gifford said.

Obama raised $25 million from January through March of 2007, a bigger sum than any current candidate raised during the corresponding period this year. The money helped Obama gain status in the race as a serious contender. Sanders, who raised the most of any Democratic candidate in the field, still fell short of Obama’s total, raising $18 million during the first three months of 2019 — almost all of it from small donors giving online.

Michael Toner, former counsel to the Republican National Committee and multiple Republican presidential campaigns, predicted Democratic candidates will become more aggressive about big-dollar fundraising as they head into the summer primary debates and feel more pressure to prove they are top contenders — or to drop out.

“You have to raise enough money to compete in these caucuses, and you’ve got to have the resources to compete in a multi-front war,” Toner said. “It’s a necessary, but insufficient, condition in term of getting nominated.”

This is how disinformation spread from fringe message boards and social media to far-right websites and cable news.

Are you watching TRACKBACK by BuzzFeed News yet? Follow along as we fight back against the rise of conspiracies, scams, and online hoaxes.

The devastating fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral led to an outpouring of anguish and sympathy. It also prompted conspiracy theorists, anti-Muslim campaigners, and far-right figures to begin spreading baseless claims and conspiratorial theories that Muslims were to blame. At no point have French authorities said the fire was deliberately set, and as of now investigators say all signs point to it being a tragic accident. But by the time official information began to spread, the seeds of an anti-Muslim narrative had been planted using false claims and innuendo. It quickly cascaded from fringe message boards and social media to far-right websites and cable news. Here’s a timeline of how a coordinated online campaign to link Muslims to the Notre Dame fire unfolded. (Note: Authorities have not released any definitive information about the cause of the fire, which means we still don’t know for sure what was responsible. This story shows how baseless and false claims sought to fill that information vacuum.) The first hours (11 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET) Fake Twitter accounts pretending to be CNN and Fox News were the first to start spreading disinformation about the fire. Each account was created this month and claimed to be a parody of the real organization. It took Twitter two hours to remove the fake CNN account, and even longer to remove the Fox News imposter.

The fake CNN account planted the idea that the fire was an act of terrorism. Meanwhile, a post from the fake Fox News account presented a fabricated tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar saying “They reap what they sow” in reference to Notre Dame. Omar never said those words, but people continued sharing the fake tweet long after the account was suspended. Both fake accounts helped lay the groundwork for the conspiracies to follow.

A little after noon, a Tennessee politician and media commentator named Christopher Hale posted a tweet saying that a friend of his had heard from staff at the cathedral that the fire was intentional. He told BuzzFeed News he deleted the tweet roughly 10 minutes later after he realized it was incorrect.

Twitter / ChrisJollyHale

“For the record, I completely believe [the fire] was an accident. The Jesuit who texted me — my friend — believes it was an accident. Conspiracy theorists who are going to run with this have zero evidence,” he told BuzzFeed News. Even though it was only online for a short period, Hale’s tweet was seen by conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars. He used the incorrect, deleted tweet as the sole basis for a story headlined “Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Fire, Worker Claims It Was ‘Deliberately’ Started.” “I regret that I became an unintended tool of the worst parts of the internet,” Hale said. “I think what’s remarkable about it is how quickly an innate desire to blame the clear accident in Paris on the Muslim community took a life of its own from a tweet that was up for 10 minutes.” Infowars posted its story just after 2 p.m. and has not issued any corrections, clarifications, or updates since. This article helped feed the idea that something was being covered up, and perhaps the fire was not an accident. Two more key anti-Muslim narratives also began during this time period. At about 1 p.m., an account tweeted a video of Notre Dame burning with shouts of “Allahu Akbar” (an Arabic phrase that roughly translates to "God is great") edited over the video. It was an obvious fake, as the audio was taken from a recording that appears as a top Google search result when looking for audio of that phrase. The video received a few dozen retweets and was later removed by Twitter. But it didn’t take long for copycats to start popping up throughout the day. The “Allahu Akbar” video hoax was born, and with it came a narrative about Muslims being happy about the fire. Just an hour after the first fake "Allahu Akbar" video, another was posted by a Twitter account called “MAGAphobia.” Instead of putting fake shouts in a real video, the poster just said that’s what the shouts were. In fact, people in the video were yelling "allais, en avant," which in French means "go on, move along."

Also at roughly 1 p.m., the far-right anti-Muslim website Jihad Watch posted a story about a Muslim woman being sentenced for a 2016 incident in which she “plotted to blow up car packed with gas canisters near Notre Dame cathedral.” The incident was real, but old and unconnected. The director of the website later tweeted that the story was scheduled to run that morning, meaning the timing was accidental.



However, many people on social media misread the story as new and connected to the fire. (The post was later updated to say at the top: “This is not a post about the fire at Notre Dame.”) Between 2 and 3 p.m. ET (when shit hit the fan) This is when anti-Muslim conspiracies and hateful posts began picking up steam on mainstream social networks and fringe message boards. 4chan, an online messaging board known as the internet’s cesspool, was filled with posts targeting Muslims, and some users also called for misinformation to be spread.

Three key narratives took hold and spread during this period: Suggestions that ISIS was responsible, the connection of this fire to previous church desecrations in France, and a continued attempt to paint Muslims as celebrating the destruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The completely unsupported ISIS connection seems to have started with PartisanGirl, a far-right Twitter account that previously spread disinformation about the conflict in Syria, among other topics. She tweeted an incomprehensible statement about ISIS destroying artifacts, and also offered a conspiracy that French President Emmanuel Macron was the one who set fire to Notre Dame to make the Yellow Vests movement — a populist political campaign for economic justice that has been fueling protests — look bad. The Gateway Pundit later published a story trying to link the Bataclan attacks by ISIS in Paris in 2015 and the Notre Dame fire. At roughly the same time, recent stories about suspicious fires in French churches began spreading rapidly by people who often help push anti-Muslim stories or conspiracy theories. The articles being shared were from reliable sources, and it’s understandable to be concerned that the Notre Dame fire may have been connected to the previous incidents. It’s also worth noting, however, that far-right personalities Mike Cernovich, Jack Posobiec, Pamela Geller, Paul Rondeau, and many others all posted these stories within roughly an hour of one another, and that some of these same people spread content that tried to point the finger at Muslims, or suggest that Muslims were pleased by the fire. The stories about other church fires were also shared by the Russian propaganda outlet RT and, a day later, by the German far-right party AfD. Around the same time, Fox News anchors had to step in as their live guests began baselessly questioning the cause of the fire, the Daily Beast reported. “It’s like a 9/11, a French 9/11,” one of the guests said. “Of course, you will hear the story of the politically— the political correctness, which will tell you it’s probably an accident.” By then, there was still no evidence of any foul play in the fire, and people were in shock as the fire was getting worse. Soon, a video of Facebook reactions posted by a French far-right personality brought forward a new anti-Muslim narrative. The video showed people with Arabic-sounding names reacting to the Notre Dame fire with smiley emojis, implying celebration. It was boosted by Infowars writer Paul Joseph Watson to his 945,000 Twitter followers and by far-right personality Katie Hopkins to her 927,000 followers. This isn’t the first time far-right personalities pointed to Facebook emojis to try to stroke anger. The same thing happened in 2017 during the London bridge attack. The laughing-face emojis were clearly in the minority of reactions to the fire video, and it's impossible to know why people chose a specific emoji, or for that matter, the religion of people reacting to a Facebook video. It’s also difficult to verify the authenticity of the accounts. The bottom line is that Facebook emojis on a video don’t tell us anything about a group of people. But it makes for good content, apparently. While that video spread, hundreds of Twitter accounts began sharing a link to a 2016 story about an unrelated terror plot, the same one Jihad Watch had posted about roughly an hour earlier. The first tweet linking to the story was posted just after 2 p.m., but soon more than 600 other accounts tweeted the same story, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis using data gathered from the Twitter API. All the tweets repeated the headline “Gas tanks and Arabic documents found in unmarked car by Paris' Notre Dame cathedral spark terror fears” and linked to the 2016 story from the Daily Telegraph. The newspaper later posted a note at the top of its story to reinforce that it was from 2016, but the link continued to be shared. It was also spread by far-right personality Faith Goldy, who was recently banned from Facebook for her white nationalist content and hate speech.

Finally, this same one-hour time period saw the first video of a worker walking on the outside of the cathedral in a tweet written in Spanish. In the coming hours, people would use the grainy video to make false claims about the fire, including that the person shown was an "Imam" or a Yellow Vest protester setting the fire. Both are false. Libération, a national French newspaper, has sifted through other footage of the fire to find the origin of the video. It was filmed after first responders to the fire had entered Notre Dame. Moments later, firefighters can be seen in the original footage. But the false claims and innuendo helped this video travel across social media and feed conspiratorial narratives. 3 p.m. onward With the narratives largely set, the remaining hours of the day, and the day after, were dedicated to further spreading these claims and accusations. Katie Hopkins claimed the destruction of the cathedral was a symbol of the West burning, and Pamela Geller pushed the narrative of Muslims celebrating. One of her posts with that message received over 32,000 shares and more than 10,000 reactions on Facebook, according to the Oxford Internet Institute Junk news Aggregator. Also on Facebook, Rush Limbaugh likened the church's destruction to the 9/11 attacks and received over 10,000 shares and 16,000 reactions. That same night on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program, commentator Mark Steyn continuously brought up terror attacks committed by Muslims, despite a lack of any indication from French officials that the Notre Dame fire was set deliberately. Lam Thuy Vo contributed reporting to this story.

〈厚生年金加入、７０歳以上も 厚労省 納付義務を検討〉――。１６日の日経新聞の朝刊１面トップ記事は衝撃だった。会社員らが加入している厚生年金の保険料を納付する義務年齢について、厚労省が現行の７０歳未満から７０歳以上に引き上げる検討に入った、というのだ。



厚労省は今年、５年に１度の公的年金制度の検証作業を実施する。記事によると、６月をめどに厚生年金の加入期間を延長した場合の年金額の試算結果を公表。保険料の支払期間について「７５歳まで」といった具体的な数値が盛り込まれるかが焦点になるという。予想されていたとはいえ、いよいよ議論が本格化するのだ。



記事では〈内閣府の調査では仕事をしている高齢者の約４割が「働けるうちはいつまでも」と答える。長生きに備えて、健康のうちは一定時間以上働く高齢者にとっては、加入期間の延長によるメリットは大きくなる〉などと解説していたが、高齢者のホンネは「年金収入だけでは暮らせないからやむを得ず働く」だろう。仮に保険料の支払い義務が７５歳なんて事態になれば、今以上に生活が困窮する高齢者が続出するのは間違いない。


The 18-year-old Florida girl 'infatuated' with the Columbine massacre killed herself in a Colorado forest following a massive manhunt that saw schools across Denver shut down.

Sol Pais was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound near the Echo Lake Campground in Mt Evans, just outside Denver, on Wednesday morning.

Witnesses told local media that Pais had earlier been spotted running naked through the woods with a gun.

Nearly 30 armed law enforcement officers swarmed the area in the moments before confirming that Pais was dead.

It is not yet clear when she took her own life but Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said he didn't believe authorities were in active pursuit at the time her body was found.

Sol Pais, 18, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound near the Echo Lake Campground in Mt Evans, just outside Denver, on Wednesday morning

The FBI revealed on Wednesday afternoon that Pais had last been spotted in that wooded area when she was dropped off by a driver on Monday afternoon.

The driver reported the information to authorities on Tuesday after investigators started their frantic search for Pais in the Denver area.

The teen had flown from Miami to Denver on Monday and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition just days before the 20th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 people.

A disturbing website belonging to Pais, as well as posts on the National Gun Forum seeking advice on buying a shotgun in Colorado, had emerged earlier on Wednesday as the manhunt was underway

Authorities said Pais had become 'infatuated' with the Columbine shooting and became concerned when she purchased three one-way tickets to Denver for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The FBI had described the Miami Beach High School senior as 'extremely dangerous' and said she had made threats to 'commit an act of violence' in Denver after becoming fixated on the shooting massacre.

Half a million students were forced to stay home on Wednesday as the manhunt for Pais continued.

They said she had not made a specific threat but said her fascination with the massacre and the gunmen and her recent actions had raised suspicions.

Two teenage boys who attended Columbine High School shot and killed 12 classmates on April 20, 1999 before committing suicide. At the time, it was the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.

A disturbing website belonging to Pais, as well as posts on the National Gun Forum seeking advice on buying a shotgun in Colorado, emerged as the manhunt was underway.

The FBI said they are looking at the website and other online activity as part of their investigation.

The website is filled with self-hate journal entries and contains a tribute to a Marilyn Manson song that was inspired by the high school shooting.

DailyMail.com has viewed the website but has chosen not to publish copies of the diary entries.

The site contains photocopied handwritten journal entries with multiple drawings of guns and troubling phrases like 'being alive is f**king overrated' and 'how do I pull it out of me? I'm f**king empty.'

The website also has the phrase '1999 - the nobodies' written on it. Marylin Manson wrote a song titled The Nobodies based on the 1999 shooting massacre at Columbine.

Another social networking page found under Pais' name contains a profile photo bearing a resemblance to photos released by authorities during the manhunt for her.

It asked for readers to be the 'best killers'.

The profile, which also contains a link back to the website with the journal entries, also has five items listed on a to do list, including: 'Self destruct, burn out, walk away, reject apologies and fade.'

She was also believed to be behind a series of posts on the National Gun Forum website last month asking for advice on buying a gun in Colorado.

'Florida resident here. I am planning a trip to Colorado in the next month or so and wanna buy a shotgun while I'm there and I was wondering what restrictions apply for me? I've found a few private sellers I might want to purchase from; is it legal for me as a Florida resident to purchase a shotgun in Colorado? I'm 18 years old too, if it's important,' she wrote.

'The problem is i have no friends in FL who are into guns like me so it's not as fun having to do all of this alone,' she wrote in a follow up post.

The FBI searched the Miami Beach home where Pais lives with her parents on Tuesday night and remained outside on Wednesday

Police vehicles sit outside Columbine high school as some Denver area schools have closed while police searched for Pais

The Denver FBI office was alerted to the potential threat early Tuesday by Miami FBI agents and they notified area schools that afternoon.

About a dozen Denver area districts called off classes for Wednesday and about a half million students were forced to stay home because authorities believe Pais could pose a threat to a school.

Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver locked their doors for nearly three hours on Tuesday afternoon before Wednesday's complete closures were announced.

An FBI bulletin from early Tuesday said authorities lacked probable cause for a formal arrest but that law enforcement should detain Pais for a mental-health evaluation.

Officials released two photos of Pais and said she was last seen in the foothills of Jefferson County on Monday dressed in a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots.

The FBI searched the Miami Beach home where Pais lives with her parents on Tuesday night and remained outside on Wednesday.

At the time, the teenager's father Gardi Pais, 58, told DailyMail.com that the family had not heard from her since Sunday.

The elder Pais said he thought his daughter had a 'mental problem' and begged her to return home.

'They are looking for her. We don't have any idea,' he said from behind his Florida front door on Tuesday.

Asked if he had a message for his daughter, Pais said: 'Please come home.' His voice trembling, he added: 'I think she's gonna be okay. I think maybe she has got a mental problem.'

Classmates at Miami Beach High School told the Miami Herald that Pais was taking AP and honor roll classes.

'She didn't seem any type of way,' Justin Norris, 18, said. 'She was just bad at starting conversations.'

Eliana Donaire, 17, said: 'She was very quiet. I would usually see her doing homework... she didn't seem weird.'

The right-leaning United Conservative Party (UCP) has taken power in the oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta, routing the left-leaning NDP.

The UCP won 63 of the 87 seats of the legislature, provisional results say.

Leader Jason Kenney, a former federal cabinet minister, will be the next premier of Alberta.

The win could reverberate beyond Alberta, setting the party on a collision course with PM Justin Trudeau's Liberals over climate change.

Mr Kenney has vowed to do away with a provincial carbon levy and to join four other provinces - including Ontario, Canada's most populous province - in fighting the federal government in court over its carbon tax.

The government recently imposed carbon taxes on four of Canada's 10 provinces - Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick - for failing to introduce their own plans for tackling climate change.

The UPC leader said he would also challenge proposed federal legislation to overhaul how major infrastructure and energy projects are reviewed and hold a referendum in Alberta on equalisation payments - a federal payout system to even out fiscal disparities among provinces - unless new pipelines are built.

Mr Trudeau offered congratulations to Mr Kenney on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he looks forward to addressing "issues of importance to Albertans and all Canadians" including "taking decisive action on climate change while getting our natural resources to market".

The UCP's victory ends four years in power for the NDP, whose 2015 victory rocked one of Canada's most conservative provinces.

The 28-day election campaign in Canada's fourth most populous province centred around its uneasy economic future and its beleaguered energy sector.

In his victory speech, the premier-designate promised quick relief for Albertans.

"Alberta is open for business," he said. "Albertans have elected a government obsessed with getting Albertans back to work."

Voters in the country's oil heartland are worried about the state of the economy amid slumping commodity prices.

"For Alberta voters, the election was driven almost entirely by economic concerns; specifically, the province's deep-seated anxiety about its oil and gas industry and the inability to increase the amount of oil it can get to market," said national non-profit pollster Angus Reid.

Thousands of jobs were lost following the global oil price crash in 2014-15 - economic doldrums inherited by the NDP, which was seeking a second mandate.

There is widespread frustration at the lack of progress on building new oil export pipelines.

Mr Kenney campaigned as a champion of the oil sector, promising to fund a "war room" to defend Canada's energy resources at home and abroad.

The campaign also served as a test with Alberta voters for Mr Kenney and his newly formed UCP, founded in 2017 with the merger of two right-leaning provincial political parties.

The one-time federal politician, who was one of the most prominent ministers serving under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, came to Alberta to unite fractured right-leaning political parties.

But Mr Kenney was often knocked off message during the campaign as controversial or offensive views expressed by some candidates came to light. Two candidates eventually resigned.

His 2017 UPC leadership campaign has also come under scrutiny amid allegations his camp colluded with a "kamikaze" candidate to discredit his main rival.
A socialist student group at the University of Buffalo is calling out the school administration for hosting “war criminal” Condoleezza Rice as a “distinguished speaker.”

The former U.S. Secretary of State and special assistant to President George W. Bush for national security is scheduled to speak Wednesday as part of a distinguished speaker series hosted by the Graduate Student Association.

“We hope that they refrain from honoring war criminals in the future."

Our statement on "Distinguished Speaker" Condoleezza Rice pic.twitter.com/C6AI5HFD8o — YDSA at UB ?? (@YDSAatUB) April 17, 2019

[RELATED: Emails: Rutgers professors pushed students to protest Condoleezza Rice as commencement speaker]

“UB YDSA emphatically supports freedom of speech, including the right to protest, and welcomes a variety of viewpoints to campus...,” the Young Democratic Socialists of America statement reads, claiming that “as National Security Advisor in the Bush Administration, [Rice] personally approved the CIA’s use of waterboarding on prisoners. She lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and used that as justification to wage a war of aggression that directly caused the violent deaths of nearly 500,000 people.”

The YDSA chapter offered a further explanation of its grievance in a statement to Campus Reform.

“While we don’t think an event recognizing Condoleezza Rice as a ‘Distinguished Speaker’ should take place, we recognize that it is unlikely that the University will cancel the event at this point,” the chapter told Campus Reform. “We hope that they refrain from honoring war criminals in the future. We will be protesting outside of the event in an effort to make the audience aware of her crimes.”

A University of Buffalo spokesman also commented to Campus Reform, saying in part that "the university does not take a position on the views expressed by those who visit our campus."

With the beating that public sector unions have taken in both the courts and the states over the past decade, it’s genuinely surprising (and exciting) to see a state actually try to expand workers’ rights rather than restrict them. That’s what’s happening in Colorado. It’s just too bad the state’s Democratic governor won’t fully commit.



Buoyed by a Democratic takeover of the state Senate in November, which handed the party unified control over Colorado’s government, Democrats in the legislature are pushing a bill to enshrine the right of state workers to collectively bargain. Per Colorado Public Radio:

If it passes, about 26,500 workers would gain collective-bargaining rights, according to a nonpartisan legislative analysis. That number accounts for the vast majority of the state’s “certified workforce,” which includes employees in executive branch offices and departments. Other state employees — such as legislative aides, judicial workers and university faculty — would not be covered. Many limits on public-sector unions remain under the bill, though. No worker would be forced to join partnerships or pay dues. Strikes would also not be allowed under any circumstance.

Per a recent paper by the left-leaning Economic Analysis and Research Network on the benefits of collective bargaining in Colorado, the state is one of just 16 that doesn’t “allow for some form of collective bargaining for all state employees,” though “exemptions exist for certain categories of workers.”

Republicans are, of course, opposed to the plan. But while Glasgow told CPR that she expects the bill to pass through the legislature, the statement on the measure from Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat who was inaugurated in January, is waffle-city:



A spokesperson for Polis provided this statement on the bill: “Our staff and the executive agencies have reviewed the legislation and have some concerns about the ramifications for both the budget process and how it interacts with the classified system. We are actively working with stakeholders and sponsors on the specifics of the bill. We appreciate everything our state employees do for Colorado.”

Jared. My friend; my guy. Don’t do this.

You cannot claim to be an advocate for workers or their labor and then, when your state has a rare opportunity to expand their rights, shit the bed over some vague concerns about what it might do to the budget. The aforementioned white paper found that turnover among “classified” state employees in Colorado is so bad that one in five job openings are now vacant, and it cost the state $48 million to fill over 4,200 positions last year. And as EARN pointed out in its research, there are pretty extensive pay gaps between white state employees and, well, everyone else:

There are a multitude of things that should be litmus tests for the Democratic Party—healthcare as a human right, LGBTQ rights, abortion rights, anti-imperialism, you get the idea—but this issue is one that already is. If someone like Conor Lamb can unequivocally support unions and workers, the Democratic governor of a state which is seemingly becoming more liberal every day can do it too. Here’s hoping that Polis understands this sooner rather than later.

While giving his last plenary speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Europe needs more affection from those who live in the bloc.

“Europe has to be loved,” said Juncker in Strasbourg on Wednesday. “If you do not love it, you are not capable of love. I love Europe, long live Europe!” said Juncker, whose mandate officially ends on 31 October, a day after the last six-month Brexit extension is due. ”

With a heavy heart I see some colleagues withdraw from politics or from parliament,” said Juncker, who had decided against another term two years ago. “I really enjoyed working here with you, learned a lot, argued a lot. But we also did a lot.“

Over the past five years, 350 legislative proposals originating from Juncker’s European Commission have been implemented , including important improvements in everyday life, but Juncker said he regretted that ihis Commission was not able to find a solution to the bloc’s still unsolved asylum policy for migrants..

“Brexit is important, but the daily lives of citizens are even more important,” said Juncker.

A new European Parliament will be elected on 23 May-26 May. Leaked projections by the internal European Parliament polls show that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will be the biggest winner from the vote with 28 MEPs added to the next EU plenary.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May‘s Conservatives are projected to win 17 seats and five each for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. 11 seats are projected to new parties, including Ukip, the pro-Brexit party of Nigel Farage, and the anti-Brexit Independent Group.

For example I believe owning a gun is a right and taking that destroys the point and soul of the USA.

OR

However not all people should be getting one.

Pick one. Giving the government the authority to pick and choose who gets to exercise a right means you are treating it as a privilege, not a right.

For example people on the no fly list,

A secret list that you aren't notified if you are on or even what the parameters are? That should be a hard no from anyone who values due process.

have certain mental disorders

The mentally ill, as a rule, are not more violent than the general population. If you want to push for an adjudication of incompetence, that is already a thing.

and child abusers and domestic violence offenders sure as hell shouldn't have one.

I'm skeptical that guns playbany significany role in child abuse, and it is already the law that convicted domestic violence offenders cannot possess a firearm.

Also it's kinda absurd that pistols you gotta be 21 to get ammo and buy the gun. It should all be 21 in my opinion.

Then move voting and draft age to 21 as well. Either they are adults or they are not.

My ideas besides those would be any gun transaction requires a background check and should have a national one easy to us and for free by the Government.

Criminals wouldn't care about such restrictions as the vast majority of guns used in crimes are already acquired illegally.

If you own a gun you are required to at purchase either prove or buy a locked container.

My house is a locked container.

Also most importantly the people that mentally unstable people shouldn't own guns.

As defined by who?

Also legalize Autos but, of course have the Class 3 License system in place

You don't know a lot about current gun laws do you?

also require training and those guns only have to be registered by the ATF.

MGs are already registered with the ATF.
Alberto Samid fue condenado este miércoles a cuatros años de prisión efectiva por ser considerado miembro de una asociación ilícita, que evadió impuestos durante la década del '90.

El Tribunal Oral en lo Penal Económico (TOPE) 1 también determinó que el empresario deberá pagar cerca 282 mil pesos para cubrir los costos de su captura, calculados por la Policía Federal.

A pesar de que su pena no está firme, deberá permanecerá detenido en el penal de Ezeiza al menos hasta que el TOPE 1 resuelva si le concede o no la prisión domiciliaria solicitada por su abogado.

El ex diputado provincial detenido con prisión preventiva por una decisión que tomó el tribunal luego de que el empresario se ausentara sin permiso a varias audiencias del juicio oral y se escapara a Belice, donde finalmente fue hallado.

También se resolvió la situación procesal de su hermana Alicia, Teresa Fornasier y Claudio Pileo con penas de tres años de prisión en suspenso y de María Susana Moreno a tres años y seis meses, de efectiva.

Samid, trasladado desde el Hospital Central Penitenciario de la cárcel de Ezeiza, escuchó el veredicto en la segunda fila de los imputados, recostado solo contra uno de los márgenes de la sala de audiencia y con una botella de agua a mano.

En los tribunales federales de Comodoro Py, los jueces del TOPE 1, José Michilini, Diego García Berro e Ignacio Fornari anunciaron que los argumentos del fallo se conocerán el 26 de abril, mientras que la defensa de Samid adelantó que apelará.

Horas antes de que se conociera el veredicto, Samid aseguró que si sigue "encerrado" se va a "cortar las venas" y y se quejó de sus condiciones de detención.

"Si sigo encerrado así, me voy a cortar las venas", aseguró Samid en los tribunales federales de Comodoro Py al hacer uso de las "últimas palabras" que se le conceden a los imputados antes de recibir el veredicto.

Samid fue juzgado como supuesto integrante de una asociación ilícita, junto a otros ocho acusados, que evadió la rendición del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA) retenido o percibido a terceros entre 1993 y 1998, entre otras maniobras.

Además del empresario, fueron juzgados su hermana Alicia y otros acusados de integrar una asociación ilícita que cometió maniobras delictivas para evadir el pago del Impuesto al Valor Agregado en la venta de carne en los frigoríficos.

Los demás acusados fueron Francisco Burgos, Lilian Lastoria, Luis Balanho y Roberto Cañete quienes fueron absueltos por el TOPE 1.

El fiscal Gabriel Pérez Barberá había pedido una pena de seis años y medio de cárcel para Samid y la AFIP, que actúa como querellante, pidió siete.



Samid había sido sobreseído en esta causa pero en agosto de 2016 la Cámara de Casación le revocó el sobreseimiento y dispuso que sea elevado a juicio oral.



Las sala IV de Casación hizo lugar a un recurso presentado por la querella de la AFIP-DGI contra la resolución del Tribunal Oral en lo Penal Económico 1 que el 19 de febrero de ese año había sobreseído a Samid y su hermana Alicia Nélida, por considerar extinguida la acción penal por el transcurso del tiempo.



Los jueces Juan Carlos Gemignani, Mariano Hernán Borinsky y Eduardo Rafael Riggi dispusieron que continúe el desarrollo de la causa y se fije, a la brevedad, una audiencia de debate de cara al juicio oral.



El denominado Rey de la Carne había sido sobreseído en la vieja causa judicial por evasión millonaria de impuestos cuando el Tribunal Oral en lo Penal Económico determinó que se habían vencido los plazos para el desarrollo de la investigación.



La causa había sido impulsada por la entonces DGI durante los años noventa cuando el entonces dirigente peronista matancero fue acusado de liderar una "poderosa asociación ilícita" para evadir impuestos por más de 50 millones de pesos a través de varias cadenas frigoríficas entre las que figuraba La Lonja.
As public banking gains momentum across the country, policymakers in California and Washington state are vying to form the nation’s second state-owned bank, following in the footsteps of the highly successful Bank of North Dakota, founded in 1919. The race is extremely close, with state bank bills now passing their first round of committee hearings in both states’ senates.

In California, the story begins in 2011, when then-Assemblyman Ben Hueso filed his first bill to explore the creation of a state bank. The bill, which was for a blue-ribbon committee to do a feasibility study, sailed through both legislative houses and seemed to be a go. That is, until Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed it, not on grounds that he disapproved of the concept, but because he said we did not need another blue-ribbon committee. The state had a banking committee that could review the matter in-house. Needless to say, nothing was heard of the proposal after that.

So when now-Sen. Hueso filed SB 528 earlier this year, he went straight for setting up a state bank. The details could be worked out during the two to three years it would take to get a master account from the Federal Reserve, by a commission drawn from in-house staff that had access to the data and understood the issues.

Sen. Hueso also went for the low hanging fruit—a proposal to turn an existing state institution, the California Infrastructure and Development Bank (or “IBank”), into a depository bank that could leverage its capital into multiple loans. By turning the $400 million IBank currently has for loans into bank capital, it could lend $4 billion, backed by demand deposits from the local governments that are its clients. The IBank has a 15-year record of success; experienced staff and detailed procedures already in place; low-risk customers, consisting solely of government entities; and low-interest loans for infrastructure and development that are in such high demand that requests are 30 times current capacity.

The time is also right for bringing the bill, as a growing public banking movement is picking up momentum across the U.S. Over 25 public bank bills are currently active, and dozens of groups are promoting the idea. Advocates include a highly motivated generation of young millennials, who are only too aware that the old system is not working for them and a new direction is needed.

Banks now create most of our money supply and need to be made public utilities, following the stellar precedent of the Bank of North Dakota, which makes below-market loans for local communities and businesses while turning a profit for the state. The Bank of North Dakota was founded in 1919 in response to a farmers’ revolt against out-of-state banks that were foreclosing unfairly on their farms. Since then it has evolved into a $7.4 billion bank that is reported to be even more profitable than JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, although its mandate is not actually to make a profit but simply to serve the interests of local North Dakota communities. Along with hundreds of public banks worldwide, it has demonstrated what can be done by cutting out private shareholders and middlemen and mobilizing public revenues to serve the public interest.

The time is right politically to adopt that model. The newly elected California governor, Gavin Newsom, has expressed strong interest both in a state-owned bank and in the IBank approach. In Los Angeles, the City Council brought a measure for a city-owned bank that won 44% of the vote in November, and City Council President Herb Wesson has stated that the measure will be brought again. Where there is the political will, policymakers generally find a way.

Advocates in eight Golden State cities have formed the California Public Banking Alliance, which co-sponsored another public banking bill filed just last month. Introduced by Assembly Members David Chiu and Miguel Santiago, Assembly Bill 857 would enable the chartering of public banks by local California governments. The bill, which has broad grassroots support, would “authorize the lending of public credit to public banks and authorize public ownership of stock in public banks for the purpose of achieving cost savings, strengthening local economies, supporting community economic development, and addressing infrastructure and housing needs for localities.”

The first hearing on Hueso’s Senate Bill 528 was held in Sacramento last week before the Senate Committee on Governance and Finance, where it passed. The bill goes next to the Senate Banking Committee. With momentum growing, California could be the first state in the 21st century to form its own bank; but it is getting heavy competition in that race from Washington State.

Washington’s Public Bank Movement: The Virtues of Persistence

Like Sen. Hueso, Washington State Sen. Bob Hasegawa filed his first bill for a state-owned bank nearly a decade ago. The measure is now in its fifth iteration. Along the way, his Senate State Banking Caucus has acquired 23 members, just three votes short of a senate majority.

As Sen. Patty Kuderer explained at an informational forum held by the Caucus in October, their bills kept getting stalled with the same questions and concerns, and they saw that a different approach was needed; so in 2017, they advised the state to hire professional banking consultants to address the concerns and to draft a business plan that would “move the concept forward from the theoretical to the concrete, so that legislators would have a solid idea of what they would eventually be voting on.” They could bypass the studies and go straight to a business plan that laid out the nuts and bolts.

The maneuver worked. Senate Bill 6375 was the first public banking bill to be advanced out of the Policy Committee with bipartisan support. It got stalled in the Ways and Means Committee, but another bill, SB 5959, was filed this year. In yet another bill, SB 6032-Supplemental Budget, the fiscal Ways and Means committee committed $480,000 to assessing risk and developing a business plan for the effort.

The form of the proposed bank was also modified: a bank that simply would have received the state’s tax funds as deposits evolved into a “co-op” that would be open to membership not just by the state but by all “political subdivisions that have a tax base.” Opening the co-op bank’s membership would allow it to generate substantially more credit than could be made from the state’s revenues alone, since it would have the ability to hold as deposits the combined revenues of cities, counties, ports and utility districts, as well as of the state itself. Those entities would also be able to borrow at below-market rates from the co-op bank and to leverage the tax dollars they collected. The concept was similar to that being advanced in California’s SB 528, which would allow the IBank to expand its lending capacity to local governments by taking the demand deposits of those same governments and affiliated public entities.

The Washington State business plan is due no later than June 30, 2019, and legislators expect to vote on the bill no later than 2020.

Whenever it happens, says Sen. Hasegawa, “I see a public bank as almost inevitable because of the current financial structures we’re required to live under.” State infrastructure needs are huge, and the existing funding options—raising taxes, cutting services and increasing debt levels—have been exhausted. Newly-created credit directed into local communities by publicly-owned banks can provide the additional funding that local governments critically need.

Whichever state wins the race for the next state bank, the implications are huge. A century after the very successful Bank of North Dakota proved the model, the time has finally come to apply it across the country.
Bovine milk is a nutritionally rich, chemically complex biofluid consisting of hundreds of different components. While the chemical composition of cow’s milk has been studied for decades, much of this information is fragmentary and very dated. In an effort to consolidate and update this information, we have applied modern, quantitative metabolomics techniques along with computer-aided literature mining to obtain the most comprehensive and up-to-date characterization of the chemical constituents in commercial cow’s milk. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS), we were able to identify and quantify 296 bovine milk metabolites or metabolite species (corresponding to 1447 unique structures) from a variety of commercial milk samples. Through our literature analysis, we also found another 676 metabolites or metabolite species (corresponding to 908 unique structures). Detailed information regarding all 2355 of the identified chemicals in bovine milk have been made freely available through a Web-accessible database called the Milk Composition Database or MCDB (http://www.mcdb.ca/).

Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is firing back at her Republican colleagues after one of them rescinded an invitation to visit a coal mine in Kentucky.

“GOP’s getting scared that up close, their constituents will realize I’m fighting harder for their healthcare than their own Reps,” she goaded them on Twitter.

Ocasio-Cortez's taunt comes after GOP Rep. James Comer offered an alternative reason why his fellow Kentucky Republican, Rep. Andy Barr, might want to rescind his coal mine invite — and it isn't because of Barr's stated rationale that she had gotten into a Twitter spat with another GOP member.

Lawmakers in his party are "making a mistake picking on" the New York freshman over issues such as nonrenewable energy because of her smarts, policy preparation and massive millennial following, Comer said Monday on the Lexington NBC affiliate's sports and news program “Hey Kentucky!”

"I don't see any upside to bringing Ocasio-Cortez in," Comer said, adding that it's "not likely" that a visit would change her views about coal in part because, he thinks, "she's pretty set in her ways."

“But Ocasio-Cortez has a movement of millennials that follow her," Comer said. "Ocasio-Cortez is a lot more prepared when she comes to committee meetings. ... She is smart, and I think that we need to be very prepared when we debate her on issues that we’re having a hard time with. There's still a future for coal, but we need to make sure that we're debating the right people on that issue.”

Comer was answering a question about Barr's decision to take back the invitation he extended to Ocasio-Cortez last month to visit his home state in order to learn how her Green New Deal proposal would affect coal miners and their families.

Despite his own caution the day before to his GOP colleagues, Comer tweeted Tuesday in response to Ocasio-Cortez's remark, “Lol, my constituents know that your Socialist policies like #MedicareForAll and #GreenNewDeal will not work.”

A representative for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment to NBC News about the flap.

Barr had made the invitation to Ocasio-Cortez after the self-described democratic socialist ardently defended her Green New Deal at a congressional hearing against criticisms that the environmental policy goals outlined in the plan represented "elitist" concerns.

"This is not an elitist issue," Ocasio-Cortez said at the hearing after mentioning her working-class background. "This is a quality-of-life issue. You want to tell people that their concern for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to that kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country. Tell that to the families in Flint, whose kids have their blood, is ascending in lead levels. Their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist."

Ocasio-Cortez told the congressman she would be "happy" to make the visit, noting that her proposal would include funding coal miners' pensions with the aim of ensuring "a just transition" and investment in jobs.

But Barr rescinded his invitation last week after Ocasio-Cortez got into Twitter tangle with Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, for his criticism of their fellow freshman Illhan Omar's remarks on a completely separate issue — the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Crenshaw and others, including conservative media, blasted Omar, D-Minn, for comments she made at an event last month in which she used vague phrasing that some saw as minimizing the 9/11 attacks.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, was founded "because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” Omar said.

Crenshaw tweeted in response: “First member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something.' Unbelievable.”

Ocasio-Cortez then responded to Crenshaw, an Afghanistan War veteran and former Navy SEAL, calling him a hypocrite.

“In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost all U.S. domestic terrorist killings," she wrote on Twitter. "Why don’t you go do something about that?"

That prompted Barr to demand an apology — and suspend his invitation.

"I urge you to apologize to our colleague prior to coming to visit Kentucky," Barr said in a letter Friday posted on Twitter, adding that her comments “demonstrate a lack of civility” toward Crenshaw.

Ocasio-Cortez's spokesman, Corbin Trent, suggested in a statement to The Courier-Journal last week that the congresswoman could always visit the state on her own.

"Luckily, Kentucky has open borders," he said.

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke rallied several hundred supporters in Short Pump on Tuesday as part of a statewide junket. He’s the first Democrat to stump in Virginia ahead of primaries next March.

O’Rourke hit many of the touchstones of the 19 and counting Democratic contenders. He called for universal healthcare, voting and immigration reform, a $15 an hour minimum wage and repealing President Trump’s tax cuts.

“We need to make sure we win that we win these elections and some more, so we can return power to people, and make decisions on behalf on one another, and not the NRA or the political action committees, or the corporations,” O’Rourke said.

The former Texas Senate contender emphasized the importance of flipping Virginia’s statehouse in November’s elections, or as he quipped, “the Commonwealth House.”

He urged immigration reform, to “use this opportunity to rewrite our immigration laws in our image” and called Trump’s proposed wall “a solution in search of a problem.”

He also laid into Trump’s inflammatory descriptions of migrants.

“You might expect to hear someone call someone else an ‘infestation’ if they’re in a position of power in some dictatorial regime,” O’Rourke said. “Maybe in the Third Reich. You wouldn’t expect it in 2019 in America.”

Local Democrat Rashida Barnes didn’t know much about O’Rourke heading into the event but was impressed he was the first candidate to reach Richmond.

“That speaks volumes to me,” she said. “We’re often overlooked.”

In a fundraising email, Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Jack Wilson said all O’Rourke’s positions were “crazy,” and urged donors to help “make Virginia red again.”

Clockwise from top left: Singer Taylor Swift, actor Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, actor Sandra Oh, Egypt and Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah, US politician Nancy Pelosi and TV news presenter Gayle King

Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah said men in "my culture and in the Middle East" need to treat women with more respect as he was named one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine.

The Egypt striker, 26, a practising Muslim, was also one of the US magazine's six cover stars and used his interview to discuss women's equality.

"We need to change the way we treat women in our culture," he told Time.

"That has to be, it's not optional."

He added: "I support the woman more than I did before, because I feel like she deserves more than what they give her now at the moment."

Salah was included on the list alongside singers Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga, US President Donald Trump, Pakistan Prime Minister and former cricketer Imran Khan, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US first lady Michelle Obama.

They are split into pioneers, artists, leaders, icons and titans, with Salah named in the latter category.

English comedian and HBO's Last Week Tonight host John Oliver, a lifelong Liverpool fan, wrote an article on Salah for the magazine.

"Mo Salah is a better human being than he is a football player," wrote Oliver. "And he's one of the best football players in the world.

"Mo is an iconic figure for Egyptians, Scousers and Muslims the world over, and yet he always comes across as a humble, thoughtful, funny man who isn't taking any of this too seriously."

Salah joined Liverpool from Roma in June 2017 and scored 44 goals in his debut season at the club.

This season he has scored 19 Premier League goals for leaders Liverpool, who are chasing their first top-flight title since 1990.

"People always have big expectations from you," he added. "You see the kids, they're wearing your shirt and they say they wish they could be like you one day.

"So they put you under pressure a bit, but that is something that makes you proud about what you have reached until now."

The other five cover stars are musician Taylor Swift, actors Dwayne Johnson and Sandra Oh, US broadcaster Gayle King and US politician Nancy Pelosi.

Salah was one of three international sports stars named on the list, South Africa's double 800m Olympic champion Caster Semenya and Japan's tennis world number one Naomi Osaka the others.

American sports stars who made the list were NBA star LeBron James, new Masters champion Tiger Woods and footballer Alex Morgan.
Edamame meets avocado in this lightened-up dip recipe. Serve it as a party snack with pita chips or veggies, and save the leftover to spread on your sandwich the next day!

Photography Credit: Elise Bauer

What Is Edamame?

Do you like edamame? These fresh soybeans are typically cooked in heavily salted water, and often served in their pods as a starter in Japanese restaurants.

Edamame are like bar nuts—they’re salty and go great with beer.

Turning Edamame into a Dip

Now that edamame have become popular in the States and you can usually easily find them frozen, both shelled and shell-on. They are rather tasty beans, so I thought we would make a simple bean dip with them.

So good! This edamame dip includes cilantro, lime juice, yogurt, and a whole avocado. Also just a little bit of Tabasco and dark sesame oil for some sparkle. It’s similar to guacamole, but with more protein and body from the edamame beans.

What to Serve with Edamame Dip

Serve the dip with pita chips, crostini, or a vegetable tray. It’s fairly thick, so you’ll want something sturdy to scoop it up. It’s also good on rice crackers or as a sandwich spread, as some of our readers who have made this dip have suggested.

By the way, if you want to make your own pita chips, cut pita bread into triangles, and cook in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes or until crispy.

How to Make it Vegan

As written, this recipe uses a half cup of yogurt to make it creamy and add some tangy flavor. But several of our readers have whipped up vegan versions with great success! Here are a few substitutes to try:

Vegan Cashew Cream

Coconut milk or other non-dairy yogurt

Olive oil, similar to hummus

How to Store this Dip

This dip keeps well for a few days if covered tightly with plastic wrap and kept in the fridge. Try squeezing a little lemon juice over the top to prevent it from browning and stir it up before serving.

Victims of bullying in secondary school have dramatically increased chances of mental health problems and unemployment in later life.

New research led by Lancaster University Management School researchers reveals stark consequences a decade on for pupils subjected to bullying. Those who are the victims of persistent or violent bullying suffer the worst consequences.

Emma Gorman and Professor Ian Walker, of the Lancaster University Department of Economics, along with research partners Silvia Mendolia, of the University of Wollongong, and Colm Harmon and Anita Staneva, of the University of Sydney, found being bullied in school increases the extent of mental health problems at age 25 by 40%.

It also increases the probability of being unemployed at age 25 by about 35%; and for those in work, it reduces their income by around 2%.

Co-author Emma Gorman said: “Bullying is widespread in schools, and many studies document a negative relationship between bullying and educational outcomes. Bullying is also an important policy issue because of concern that in addition to educational outcomes, being bullied may lead to negative impacts on young people’s lives in the long-term, such as low self-esteem, mental health conditions and poorer job prospects.

“Our research shows that being bullied has negative impact on important long-term outcomes, especially unemployment, income and ill-health. Being bullied causes detrimental effects on children’s lives not just in the short-term, but for many years after. These are more pronounced among pupils who experience persistent bullying, or violent types of bullying.

“Our findings suggest that a more targeted approach to reduce the most extreme forms of bullying may be warranted.”

The research, presented at the Royal Economic Society's annual conference at the University of Warwick, analysed confidential data on more than 7,000 school pupils aged 14-16 from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England.

About half of pupils involved, who were interviewed at regular intervals until they were 21, and once again at age 25, reported experiencing some type of bullying between the ages of 14 and 16. The information – reported by both the child and parents – recorded how frequently the children were bullied, and what type of bullying they experienced.

Examples of bullying within the study include being called names; being excluded from social groups; being threatened with violence; and experiencing violence.

As well as the consequences later in life, the research shows bullying affects the academic achievement of the victims while they are in school, and beyond into further and higher education.

Bullying reduces the probability of gaining five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C by 10%, and decreases the probability of staying on to take A-levels by 10%.
In the wake of the devastating fire that ripped through the Notre Dame Cathedral, ultimately toppling its iconic spire, people of all different backgrounds mourned the destruction of one of the world’s most famous and beloved architectural wonders — an outcry so diverse that it even included the Church of Satan.

Founded by Anton Szandor LaVey, the Church of Satan calls itself “the first above-ground organization in history openly dedicated to the acceptance of Man’s true nature—that of a carnal beast, living in a cosmos that is indifferent to our existence.”

In a tweet this Monday from its official Twitter account, the church called the cathedral a “monument to the genius of those who designed and built it.”

“We mourn the loss of this historical and architectural treasure,” the tweet read. “It was a monument to the genius of those who designed and built it, and we grieve with Paris and all who basked in its splendor.”

In a followup tweet, the church quoted one its high priests, Peter H. Gilmore.

“I spent several hours there back in the mid 70’s, toured it, going up one tower and then listened to organist Pierre Cochereau practice. Very moving experience, contemplating all of the history it saw.”

Individuals, companies and institutions have donated around $950 million to rebuild the cathedral, according to The New York Times. French President Emmanuel Macron has set a goal if having the landmark rebuilt in just 5 years.

Image copyright Facebook, courtesy of Impact City Church Image caption Associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey and lead pastor Justin Ross apologised on Monday for the "inappropriate" lesson

An Ohio church has apologised after a video emerged of students in a youth programme spitting on, slapping and cutting a pastor at his request.

Footage posted on Facebook showed young people lining up to strike associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey, who intended it to be a lesson on crucifixion before Easter.

The video sparked outrage from parents, prompting an apology from Mr Dempsey.

Mr Dempsey said he meant to show students "how much Jesus loved them".

"I am so sorry for misrepresenting the community, the church, the parents, the students", Mr Dempsey said in a video posted to the church's Facebook page.

"It was not my intention, my intention was just to show them how much Jesus loved them."

In the video, Mr Dempsey and lead pastor Justin Ross expressed regret over the incident, which took place during a Monday after-school hangout programme at the Impact City Church in Pataskala, Ohio.

"Jaddeus got up in front of the students and he says, 'I'm going to ask you to do something that might seem a little crazy, but if there's anyone here that would like to spit in my face, you can do so without any repercussions'", Mr Ross said.

Mr Ross said some students "were a little caught off guard", while others were "excited...because they'd never had an opportunity to spit in someone's face'".

While some refused, many of the young people accepted the invitation, lining up to spit in Mr Dempsey's face.

Mr Dempsey then invited students to slap him.

Again, though several students declined, some shouting "no" in the background, several students participated. One male student rolled up his sleeve before issuing an open-handed slap to the pastor's face, as others clapped and cheered in the background.

Mr Dempsey then offered students a steak knife, asking to be cut in the back. Video shows him removing his shirt and instructing students on where to place the knife.

"He had the opportunity to share a message about Easter", Mr Ross said of Mr Dempsey, "And he chose to use an illustration to explain a very important topic about the crucifixion but the illustration went too far."

But for many in the non-denominational church's community, the apology fell short.

Though Mr Dempsey said the idea for the lesson was entirely his, other adults including Mr Ross were present throughout the encounter.

A 12-year-old boy handled the steak knife and his mother, identified as Mandy, told local CBS affiliate WBNS she received a call from a friend who had seen video online and rushed to pick up her son.

"The guy that's in there that's getting spit on, turns around and he grabs the knife and he hands it right to my son", she said. "I was very disturbed."

Mandy told WBNS her son will not be returning to the church and that she has reported the incident to the local sheriff's office.

While most members of the community expressed concern over the video, others rushed to defend both Impact City Church and Mr Dempsey, who said he has been a student leader for almost four years.

"Impact City has amazing pastors, an amazing congregation...and they do so much for the city of Pataskala", one person commented on the apology video. "As wrong as this lesson was, if you look at the whole picture, it is a lesson of what Jesus went through."

Image copyright Facebook courtesy of Lola Hatfield Image caption A Snapchat video posted to Facebook showed students spitting on associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey.

Holly Collier, who attended Impact City Church for two years said she was "broken-hearted" watching the video.

"It was a terrible judgment call," she told the BBC.

Ms Collier said her daughter, Kelsey, 16, attended a summer camp led by Mr Dempsey two years ago.

"Jaddeus has a very pure heart", Ms Collier said. "I honestly believe he had good intentions."

Kelsey told the BBC that Mr Dempsey "is the most fun-loving guy you will ever meet."

"Jaddeus and people in that church were always there for us...they're the most understanding, least judgmental people you will ever meet", she said.

"I don't think someone should be judged just based on one mistake, that one mistake doesn't define who he is."

Kelsey said that three of her friends were at the church that evening, but none participated in assaulting Mr Dempsey.

"They didn't take part in it", she said. "It just blew their minds."

According to a second post on the Impact City Church Facebook page, a formal review and investigation has now been launched by the board of directors.

"Our pastor is making himself available to meet personally with every student and their parents who were present at the student gathering on Monday", the post read. "Our staff will be reaching out to these families as soon as possible."
Denver is now voting on whether it should become the first US city to effectively decriminalize mushrooms containing the psychedelic psilocybin — also known as magic mushrooms.

Initiative 301 would designate “the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms” among people 21 and older as Denver’s lowest possible law enforcement priority, and prohibit the city from spending resources to pursue criminal penalties related to the use or possession of psilocybin mushrooms among people 21 and older.

It would also “establish the psilocybin mushroom policy review panel to assess and report on the effects of the ordinance.”

The initiative would not legalize magic mushrooms; they’d remain illegal under state and federal law. And it wouldn’t decriminalize or deprioritize the distribution and sales of psilocybin mushrooms — all of that could still be pursued by police.

Ballots containing the initiative were sent out Monday, Kyle Jaeger reported for Marijuana Moment.

Advocates for the measure argue that decriminalization would shift law enforcement resources away from pursuing nonviolent offenses. They claim that psilocybin is safe, nonaddictive or close to nonaddictive, and that a growing body of evidence suggests the drug has therapeutic benefits for illnesses ranging from depression to end-of-life anxiety to addiction.

Opponents worry that decriminalization could lead to more drug use. Especially in Denver, they’re concerned that decriminalization could perpetuate the city’s reputation as “a drug-friendly city,” Jackson Barnett reported for the Denver Post. Critics also point out psilocybin does have some risks — particularly, experts say, the possibility of accidents and traumatic experiences that can be psychologically damaging (especially among people predisposed to mental illness).

One potential source of real-world evidence here: Portugal. After the country decriminalized all drugs, it saw a decrease in drug-related deaths and drops in reported past-year and past-month drug use, according to a 2014 report from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. But it also saw an increase in lifetime prevalence of drug use, as well as an uptick in reported use among teens after 2007.

But Portugal also simultaneously adopted special commissions that attempt to link people with drug addictions to treatment. Although the success of the commissions has yet to be thoroughly evaluated, it’s possible that even as decriminalization increased drug use, the commissions and more access to treatment got so many people off drugs that drug use still fell overall.

Still, decriminalization alone may have its benefits. A 2009 report from the libertarian Cato Institute, written by Glenn Greenwald, concluded that decriminalization freed people from the “fear of arrest” when they sought help for their addiction and “freed up resources that could be channeled into treatment and other harm reduction programs.”

What effects psilocybin decriminalization would have in the US, Colorado, or Denver, however, remains to be seen. Even more so than marijuana legalization, this is an area of policy that’s largely untested in modern America.

This kind of pioneering vote isn’t new for Denver or Colorado as a whole. In 2012, Colorado and Washington state became the first two states to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

Other places, particularly Oregon, are considering measures to change their laws regarding psilocybin as well.

But in Denver, voters will make the final choice on their own ballot initiative by the end of May 7 — and could make their city the first to decriminalize magic mushrooms.
With Strasserism becoming a common accusation made towards various political trends on the left, K. T. Jamieson makes a historical investigation of Strasserism and its ideology and argues that it creates more confusion than clarity to label the right wing of social democracy as ‘Strasserism.’

Strasserism, the “Red-Brown Alliance,” and the Online Left

Orwell, the conservative’s favorite socialist, famously once opined in 1944, during the peak of actually existing fascism, that “fascism,” in the pens and mouths of the literati, had been voided of all content and transformed into a floating signifier attached to foes of all kinds. The right has been grateful ever since for Orwell’s equivocation, as their own genealogy contains some shameful relatives they’d rather forget. He declined to provide any original definition of fascism, but he did correctly perceive that its emotional payload made it a useful label for ideologists.

Recently, a related label has bubbled up into left online chatter, a close kin of so-called National Bolshevism—Strasserism. In the majority of instances, this use of “Strasserism” should not be taken literally, but as shorthand for a defiantly edgy brand of populism, whether nominally left or right. This has not stopped, however, a slew of thinkpieces and Twitter “analysis” dedicated to turning over every rock, no matter how seemingly innocuous, in the search for “red-brownism.” For the most part, this discourse treats Strasserism and National Bolshevism as functionally equivalent, rarely actually interrogating their historical content. The former has, for whatever reason, recently trended over the latter, perhaps because of its novelty.

“Strasserism” as a polemical category has become part of the tedious dialectic between two camps within the left over identity politics. It is rare that genuinely Marxist perspectives find themselves represented in this argument; it is a (mostly online) dispute between, on the one hand, a right-opportunist and workerist social-democratic tendency, and on the other, a “common sense” activist leftism, in which class is merely one identity among others in an intersectional coalition. What both sides share is a conviction, conscious or not, that is a denial that the proletariat represents a universal class.

It is within this discourse that Strasserism has been applied to the former by the latter, and then by the former to themselves in an act of ironic appropriation. A common target is Angela Nagle, whose Kill All Normies—essentially a Dummy’s Guide to 4chan—first brought her public attention. The book’s thesis, supported by research which consisted mostly of Wikipedia and many nights spent lurking on various internet fora, was perceived as “SJWs created the Alt-Right.” This naturally opened up an audience which clamored for “normie socialism,” which is social democracy minus the sorts who might appear on a Youtube cringe compilation, or as Kate Griffiths defined it, “an assertion of electoral politics, and specifically those within the Democratic Party, as the horizon of the socialist movement today as opposed to direct action and working class self activity.” Nagle followed up this hit with an essay misusing Marx to argue against open borders and reprised it in an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s primetime Fox News slot. Carlson made an obvious choice, as with shifting winds he has exchanged his bow-tie libertarianism for a brand of Laschian populism that looks backward to Fordism and its single-income nuclear family. “Strasserite” has also been reserved for the subreddit r/stupidpol, who with dubious humor titled their podcast feed (an aggregation of other podcast episodes) “Strasserites in Pooperville” after a clumsy Twitter clapback. Other targets include Aimee Terese (formerly of Dead Pundits Society), Michael Tracey, Benjamin Studebaker, The eXile, and Anna Khachiyan of Red Scare.

The most recent fusillade in this mirror-universe culture war is Peter Soeller’s recent Medium two-parter, which warns of a “merger of nationalism with socialist welfare policies to strengthen a mythologized white working class.” Mostly, though, it consists of screencaps and bizarrely elaborate analytics of Twitter networks that relate in some way to r/stupidpol. . Strasserism is here viewed as a possible consequence of “class reductionism.” Conveniently, Soeller rejects the Marxist notion that fascism has a class dimension, instead embracing a non-explanation: fascism is an “autonomous outgrowth of internalized reactionary ideas.” This interpretation of fascism as a mind-virus that infects Twitter accounts is not only silly, but self-serving. As I will argue later, this kind of unprincipled Nazi-hunting is driven by an implicit acceptance of the category of “social fascism,” which in its sensationalism crowds out genuine Marxist criticism of social democracy.

There are other examples. Black Socialists of America, a small organization mostly known for its social media presence, tweeted a thread in March which claimed that Strasserism manipulated anti-liberalism to trick leftists into supporting nationalism, antisemitism, and xenophobia. It included several incorrect claims, such as that Otto Strasser saw Marxism-Leninism as “a softer, Russian form of National Socialism,” or that the Strasser brothers sought cooperation with the Soviet Union. This thread more or less baited Marxists, especially Leninists, with the smear of Strasserism. BSA’s own leanings are vaguely Proudhonist. Accordingly, the thread was capped off with a warning that, among other things, “decentralization” should be a sticking point for leftists, lest they fall prey to the wiles of fascists in red clothing.

Alexander Reid Ross has made something of a minor career out of “red-brown” investigation. He has written multiple essays and a full-length book on the subject. Ross has long maintained a presence online as an anarchist whose foreign policy views conveniently line up with that of the American state department. It is not surprising that this “CIAnarchist,” whose Russia obsessions often fail to separate him from the average boomer liberal, manages to place Chapo Trap House, The eXile, and the “dirtbag left” (a marketing neologism for a brand of leftist humor) in the same Venn diagram as Alexander Dugin, who most agree is a literal fascist. The title of Against the Fascist Creep, his 2017 book on the subject, refers to “the crossover space between right and left that engenders fascism.” This is clearly a nod to liberal horseshoe theory, and Ross positions Strasserism between the ends of the horseshoe, with the (trivially obvious) caveat that the Strasser duo were not leftists. To prevent this red-brown menace, Ross calls for leftists to “abandon the geopolitics of edgelords, and build a public reputation as… defenders of the commonweal.” Translated, we might say this equates to siding with Western NGOs on global conflicts, just to be sure you won’t be lumped in with fascists.

Of course, sincere (or merely half-ironic) Strasserites exist, particularly online. Any foray into the murky corners of Frog Twitter or the Chans will reveal a buffet of ideologies for the taxonomist. It is here where one will most likely encounter the syncretism of which Strasserism is a subtype. Of course, this syncretism is not exactly a fusion of left and right, but mostly rightist ideas in an unfamiliar, and superficially “left,” package. Cold War stereotypes of Actually Existing Socialism, morally inverted and divested of any content too meaningful to capture in Youtube compilations of military parades are joined to the standard grievances of the far right—the collapse of family, race, and nation. John Paul Cupp, the white nationalist who idolized Juche and Iraqi Ba’athism before converting to Islam, probably best exemplifies the lunatic edge of this spectrum, on which one can find every sort of pathology.

This pseudo-syncretism is a product of a unipolar world in which a victorious liberalism, having defeated all alternatives, drives its reactionary critics into cooperation and coalition with any forces of resistance. Indeed, this is the basic premise of Dugin’s The Fourth Political Theory—a popular frontism of the far right. Dugin wishes to constrain what he calls the “monotonic process” through a global realignment informed by a dichotomy between, among other things, land and sea powers (in Dugin’s jargon, Eurasian and Atlanticist). This monotonic process is akin to Hegel’s concept of bad infinity, a linear series of self-referrals which progresses continually along one axis, without ever becoming “total” and all-embracing. It is grouped in with the ideas of Enlightenment, progress, and the West as a whole, which only a coalition of particularisms can combat effectively. One could say that this is not so much syncretism as the right-wing of post-modernism, which takes the incommensurability of groups and identities for granted.

There may also be an element of novelty, as this sort of syncretic or post-modern fascism can surprise those who expect that fascism is incapable of evolution, stuck permanently in a dead-end of Nazi LARPing. Individuals like Cupp demonstrate that the far right is willing to experiment, but also that without a mass base the political elides into the aesthetic—it retreats into what Carl Schmitt, in his self-critique Political Romanticism, calls the “cathedral of the personality.” Given the personalities involved, we might rather call them basements.

Returning to Strasserism more specifically, it is known to the English-speaking fascist world primarily through A. K. Chesterton, who met Otto Strasser in 1955, during his post-war return journey to West Germany via Ireland. A. K. Chesterton was the cousin of Catholic traditionalist and witticism-generator G. K. Chesterton, whose distributism (and that of Hilaire Belloc’s) bears more than some resemblance to Otto’s own system, as we shall see later. A. K. Chesterton shared with Strasser his medievalism, ruralism, and opposition to Hitler, although this is mostly where the similarities end. However, he is seen as a foundational figure for the British fascist organization the National Front, and it is through him that Strasserism became, if in a muddled form, almost an official ideology of the National Front, particularly during the 1980s. It was in this period that the edgelord neofolk band Death in June formed, taking its moniker from the infamous Night of the Long Knives, in which Otto Strasser’s brother Gregor was executed. A former member of Death in June, Tony Wakeford, joined the National Front for a time, and lyrics he composed during this time demonstrate the flavor of the NF’s “Strasserism”:

All the same height and all the same weight All the same voice and much the same shape Pressed to a pattern and shoved into a line Bled by the rich and led by the blind Progress, progress—there’s progress! Such is the joining of people to state The state is the father, the mother and mate It knows how you think, it says what you need With total conviction it prints what you read Progress, progress—there’s progress!

This criticism of the state-as-leveler is, as will be discussed later, certainly present in the mature ideology of Otto Strasser. There is no doubt it made him especially amenable to Troy Southgate, the originator of so-called “National Anarchism,” who wrote a biography of Otto Strasser (Otto Strasser: The Life & Times of a German Socialist) and praised the Strassers for engaging in “a war of ideology with Hitler himself, a man who refused to advocate the decentralization of State power.” Groups in America like White Aryan Resistance, which hosts English translations of Otto Strasser on its website, also claim Strasserism as an influence. While it’s doubtful that there is a strict lineage from the Strassers to these groups, it provides an aesthetic packaging suited to the lumpenized base of the white nationalist movement.

Marxists have always acknowledged that fascism is often anti-bourgeois, if not anti-capitalist, and as such is not merely a dupe of the establishment. As early as 1934, Bukharin acknowledged that fascism was often anti-capitalist in its sloganeering, while (in his view) at the same time seeking to strengthen capitalism by a “speedy reorganisation of the bourgeois ranks,” which he analogizes to the development of absolute monarchy out of feudalism, which delayed the end of the feudal order precisely by introducing uniformity and discipline into what had been a confusing web of private loyalties. J. Sakai, among others, rejects the vulgar Marxist opinion that fascists were merely puppets of big capitalists, and portrays them as part of a movement of “failed men”—declassed professionals, disgraced officers, and immiserated farmers and small craftsmen—who, in their victimized chauvinism, sought to replace the businessman and politician with the soldier. Sakai goes so far as to say that fascism can be anti-imperialist, insofar as imperialism functions to stabilize a bourgeois global order which is at odds with settler particularism (which characterizes the imperative of the former as “invade the world, invite the world”).

We should certainly not dismiss the possibility of a rightward drift within the broader socialist movement, or the need for correcting chauvinist attitudes within the left. Nor should we deny that there is an “anti-imperialism of fools,” which has found its way into the left on some occasions. However, the recent revival of this term provides an occasion for an investigation into historical Strasserism, and the evidence will make it clear that it shares boundaries with other ideologies—but not necessarily socialism. Unpacking its logic will reveal that its usage in the context of internecine leftist spats is fundamentally wrongheaded and that we should be cautious about hyping up the threat of “red-brownism.” Moreover, it will vindicate the central importance of class struggle in understanding the development of reactionary ideology, and in particular the proletariat as a revolutionary subject.

To begin with, most histories of fascism touch on the Strasser brothers only in passing. When they are mentioned, it is in connection with Otto Strasser’s paramilitary “resistance” organization, the Black Front, and with the purge of late June, 1934, known as the Night of the Long Knives, in which Gregor Strasser was assassinated.

The brothers are mostly absent from A. James Gregor’s oeuvre, surprising given his project of rehabilitating the “totalitarianism” thesis of Hannah Arendt and others in which fascism and Marxism are interpenetrative and linked by a hatred for liberal civil society (they are not mentioned once in his best-known work, Marxism, Fascism, and Totalitarianism). Roger Griffin’s account in The Nature of Fascism is typical, asserting that the brothers were divided on the question of loyalty to the NSDAP (“… Gregor Strasser remained faithful to Nazism while his brother Otto was its bitter critic”) and folding into the “instrinsically vague term” of Strasserism-related concepts like National Bolshevism and Third Positionism. Robert Paxton refers to Gregor Strasser as “a leader of [the NSDAP’s] anticapitalist current” and to both brothers as economic “radicals,” while also repeating the claim that Otto was the more radical of the two. Though he does not mention them by name, Eric Hobsbawm’s characterization of Strasserism in The Age of Extremes cuts closer to the matter:

“… [A] utopia of a return to some kind of little man’s Middle Ages, full of hereditary peasant-proprietors, artisan craftsmen … and girls in blonde plaits … a programme that could [not] be realized in major twentieth-century states.”

Peter Stachura takes this further and asserts, against the conventional view, that a “left-wing” of Nazism does not exist “as a coherent ideological, organizational, or political entity” and that Gregor Strasser’s “socialism” was “…vacuous, amounting to no more than an emotionally-based, superficial, petty-bourgeois anticapitalism.”

A Biographical Sketch of the Strasser Duo

Gregor and Otto were born in 1890s Bavaria to Peter Strasser, a lifelong civil servant and devout Catholic. The two brothers inherited more than their father’s faith and appreciation for civil service. According to a third brother, Bernhard, their father was a polemical advocate of a form of “German socialism” under his pen name, Paul Weger. In their father’s book, Der Neue Weg or “The New Way,” he describes the “curing of ills brought about by international, liberal capitalism by the introduction of a form of socialism at the same time nationalist and Christian.” Peter Strasser was not alone in his beliefs during this period. An entire generation dedicated to “conservative revolution” grew up in the fading shadow of Bismarck’s legacy, molded by the experiences of the First World War. Both brothers would later enlist at the earliest opportunity.

Strasserism was a product of sibling synergy, but it should be noted that most of the details of Strasserism were worked out primarily by Otto. Partly this is because Gregor was executed in 1933, while Otto continued writing into the 1960s. It is also, however, attributable to a difference in temperament between the brothers. Gregor was a man of deeds more than words and lacked the literary and theoretical bent which Otto exhibited during his literary career. Fittingly, Otto entered the profession of law (Gregor ran a pharmacy for most of his adult life). Otto was prolific, particularly during his period of exile, writing more than 6 books between 1930 and 1955. Many of these were published in English, sometimes even with separate American and British printings. The reasons for this will soon become clear.

For his literacy, Otto occasionally received casual abuse from his superiors, particularly in military service. A corporal targeted Otto, then a teenage volunteer in the First World War, for his intellectualism and commanded him to perform humiliating tasks such as cleaning filthy stable hay with his bare hands, and this hazing was continued later in the war by a staff sergeant who attempted to have him court-martialed after a series of escalating incidents. Hitler himself, during his first meeting with Otto in the fall of 1920, dismissed him as an Intellektbestie—an “intellectual crank.”

Unlike Otto, Gregor’s contributions were not independent from the activities of the NSDAP. Along with Goebbels, he authored the so-called Strasser Program of 1925, but its content provoked a backlash from Hitler and was swiftly abandoned. Apart from this, Gregor’s writings are scanty and poorly known. However, he was an able speaker, a talent which propelled him to the top of the party ranks. In tenor and content, these speeches are tailored to the NSDAP’s need for expanded recruitment in northern Germany, with its large populations of industrial workers, particularly in the Ruhr. A typical example is his speech of June 15, 1926, referred to as “Thoughts about the Tasks of the Future.” Here, socialism is presented as a moralizing mystification, an idea-mood. There is a sentimental appeal to spirit over “materialism” and the need for an economic system replacing the “immoral evaluation of individuals according to wealth and money instead of responsibility and achievement,” or more succinctly, ‘work above property.” In fact, for all its putative socialism, Gregor’s speech sounds at times meritocratic. His argument for a state which rewards achievement rests precisely on natural inequality, but he rejects “blood tests, Nordicization, and so forth” as dubious to his “practical mind.” Rather, Gregor says, we ought to have compulsory trade apprenticeship for a period of one year, with two years of voluntary military service reserved for the best candidates. The result, so he concludes, would be that such individuals would “be the best of their people, the racial best.” After Gregor’s death, Otto would expand and re-work these themes, particularly in Germany Tomorrow, written in 1940.

Otto began his political life on the right wing of social democracy—incidentally, where contemporary “Strasserites” like Angela Nagle belong today. He was a member of the SPD and supported the Weimar government until possibly 1920. In his 1940 autobiography, which bears the incongruously twee title Hitler and I, he recounts his break with the SPD as a consequence of the perceived betrayal of the Bielefeld Agreement, which seems to have disillusioned him. Though he did not participate in the Ruhr uprising, he took an active role in the defense of the government against the Kapp putschists Erhardt and Luttwitz, claiming to have led “three squads of Berlin workingmen,” and apparently sided with the view of so-called moderates in the USPD that the Bielefeld compromise was a fitting reward for services rendered. When it was abrogated by the independent initiative of the Reichswehr and, of course, the Freikorps, Otto was “disheartened … and felt like a ship without a rudder.”

Another incident may shed light on Otto’s break with the SPD. One biographer reports that he was present at a speech given by Kurt Eisner in Bad Eibling, November 1918. Desperate to conceal his identity as an ex-officer, he nevertheless was drawn by curiosity to the crowd of attendees, described as mostly peasantry. When Eisner railed against the officer class that “went whoring and boozing” while sending their subordinates to die, Strasser hotly delivered a rebuke: casualties among officers were three times that of ordinary soldiers! “Where were you,” he interrogated, “in the war, Herr Eisner? I was at the front … ask these loudmouthed gentlemen here where they were, and if they only had sixpence a day, like us.” His wounded pride revealed himself to be an officer, and the attendees carried him out in a ruckus. In style this incident resembles a parable (or perhaps an email forward from your ex-marine uncle) and is possibly apocryphal, but it demonstrates the real martyr complex that military service had created in the Strasser brothers, like other fascists of their generation.

Thus it was insufficient nationalism, insufficient veneration of the officer class, and not their hypocrisy, that likely led Otto to break with the SPD. If it was merely the latter, he should have been driven into the arms of the KPD. Instead, only months later in October 1920, he decided to accept his brother’s invitation to dinner with Hitler and General Ludendorff.

Otto’s own recounting of this meeting evinces a journalist’s eye for characterization. While he was impressed by Ludendorff’s stolid and even-keeled temperament, which he seemed to see reflected in his physiognomy (one “sensed his will-power immediately”), Hitler appeared to be “trying to occupy as small a place upon his chair as possible … to shelter under the redoubtable general’s wing.” Hitler’s pallor “indicated lack of fresh air and physical exercise”; his manner was “both obsequious and sullen.” When Hitler interrogated Otto for his role in opposing the Kapp putsch, he shot back that his faction of “Reds” were “not rebels, but patriots … trying to check the rebellious followers of a few reactionary generals,” accusing Kapp of being “hand-in-glove with Tirpitz, the Prussian reactionaries, the Junkers, heavy industry, Thyssen and Krupp.”

Given that this is Otto’s own account, it is likely he exaggerates his boldness here. In any event, the meeting did not immediately convince him: Otto would not join the NSDAP until 1925. His brother, on the other hand, was a convinced National Socialist by the time of this meeting and had even participated in the suppression of the Ruhr uprising which had taken place alongside the Kapp putsch. His sympathies were clearly with the “reactionary generals” whom his brother had excoriated at the dinner table.

In fact, Gregor Strasser never turned fully renegade and was essential to the formation and development of National Socialist ideology. His closest collaborator was none other than Goebbels. During the period of “factional” struggle between northern and southern party organizers in 1925, Goebbels and Gregor—along with Otto—were allies in the “socialist” northern faction, and, as we have seen, would together draft the November 22, 1925, Strasser Program in Hanover.

This program was in most ways not a radical departure from party orthodoxy, but a clarification and expansion of the 25-Point Program drafted by Hitler, Anton Drexler, and debt-crank Gottfried Feder in 1920. The 25-Point Program called for, among other things, the nationalization of trusts, a “division of profits” from heavy industry, abolition of “unearned” income and “rent-slavery,” and expropriation of land property “for the purposes of public utility.” It was the interpretation of Point 17 that generated the most controversy: the expropriation of the princes deposed in the German Revolution.

More than anything, it was this issue—the expropriation of the princes—which created the split between the left and right wings of the NSDAP. The alternative of the “right” faction was to expropriate Jewish immigrants who had arrived after the start of August 1914. Hitler responded to the Hanover meeting with a conference in Bamberg on February 14, 1926, and was unequivocal in his opposition to the expropriation of the princes, stating that “there are no princes, only Germans.” Aside from this disagreement, the main aim of the Bamberg Conference was to rally both the northern and southern sectors of the NSDAP around his charismatic leadership. Disputes over program could only be resolved through appeal to the Fuhrerprinzip. All present, including Gregor Strasser, eventually accepted this resolution.

The Strassers continued to operate their printing press, distributing newspapers in several major cities. However, these operations would be steadily disrupted. Finally, in a proclamation entitled “The Socialists are Leaving the NSDAP,” issued by Otto on July 4th, 1930, he announced his final break with Hitler and his party. Here he proclaims that national socialism was intended as a republican movement against hereditary monarchy, and decries the “exaggerated worship of the fascist authoritarian state.” He draws a direct comparison between the NSDAP of this period, and that of the SPD after 1918, citing their cooperation and coalition with bourgeois parties—in the case of the former, the Deutschnationale Volkspartei or DNVP, whose head was the wealthy industrialist Alfred Hugenberg. The immediate catalyst of this memo, however, was Hitler’s earlier order on June 30 to the Berlin Gauleiter to purge, in his words, the “salon Bolsheviks.” In a sense, Otto had quit before he could be fired. His brother Gregor, whether from resignation and despair, or blind loyalty, persisted in the party. An attempted intervention by Otto during a May 9, 1933 meeting in Munich was apparently unsuccessful. Less than a year later on June 30, 1934, he was rounded into a cell and shot to death, a casualty of the infamous Night of the Long Knives.

It was shortly after Otto‘s proclamation in 1930 that he founded, that same year, the Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists (KGRNS)—better known by its paramilitary designation, the Black Front. Otto Strasser and the Black Front have become so closely identified that the Black Front, along with the Night of the Long Knives, are the two most familiar elements of Strasserite mythology to the layman. Its fighting strength and overall relevance to the German situation then unfolding was doubtless inflated by Otto, however. It had only around six thousand members in May 1931, two thousand of which were former SA who had been expunged from NDSAP, or quit in sympathy, after the so-called Stennes Revolt of April 1, 1931. This was an attempted coup of Hitler from within the NSDAP: a certain SA leader in Berlin, Walther Stennes, attempted to occupy the party’s offices and was swiftly expelled by local police. Stennes continued to work with Otto Strasser, although he never joined the Black Front. The ranks of the Black Front within the KGRNS numbered, at most, only three hundred.

After the KGRNS was banned in February 1933, the Black Front continued to operate via underground cells, although it is not certain what, if anything, they accomplished. In fact, some have interpreted it as a farcical public relations stunt, especially after its ban, consisting of “a small circle of personal friends, who found it useful to hang onto Strasser’s febrile journalistic coattail … [No ex-Black Fronters] within Germany … were in contact with Strasser.”

Here we have an explanation for the connection between Otto Strasser and the British far right, and why so many of his works have been translated into English and distributed across the English-speaking world. Otto’s strategy during his period of exile revolved around obtaining recognition as a “resistance” leader, puffing up his irrelevant grouplet so as to attract notice from overseas Allied intelligence. This strategy, if not a resounding success, did meet with some approval, particularly with the British Foreign Office, and later with Canadian officials.

Otto was, in fact, a known quantity to English speakers, especially in Britain. A sympathetic Englishman and correspondent for the London Times, Douglas Reed, considerably aided his blitz of publications, even publishing several biographies of Strasser. One of these, Nemesis? The Story of Otto Strasser and the Black Front, was referenced by George Orwell in a review of a separate Reed book in The Observer, in which he characterizes Strasser’s program as “simply a modification of Hitler’s … Nazism was to be more or less retained, the Jews were to be persecuted, but a little less viciously, and Britain and Germany were to gang up for an attack on the U.S.S.R.” Then there is the curious trivia that, while in Bermuda, Otto was interviewed by none other than H.G. Wells, who had traveled there for that purpose, later publishing a scathing article entitled “Otto Strasser: An Ally We Don’t Want” . “Ally” here is intended quite literally.

Otto certainly strove to make himself more palatable to the English. He is careful to never, or rarely, criticize England in the works of his exile period while reserving plenty of scorn for “Prussianism,” a bête noire still haunting the memories of English generation of the First World War. His personal retellings of the struggle with Hitler are highly dramatized, at times reading more like an adventure novel than an autobiography—again and again, Otto eludes the clutches of the “Black Guards,” Hitler’s henchmen, and lives to fight another day. Thus he portrayed himself as a plucky resister who was, moreover, even sympathetic to England and English culture.

The reason for Otto’s self-marketing was self-preservation. As early as 1939, he believed that England would resolve the war. A dispatch to the Black Front in May of that year reads in part:

…[E]ven if Italy should fight at Germany’s side the French and British fleets will quickly secure mastery of the Mediterranean. With the collapse of Poland a new political and military stage in the war will be reached. … We must overthrow Hitler through a domestic revolution in Germany, in order to save Germany. The whole strategy of our campaign, from the first hour of the war on, must be ruled by the principle: ‘Only the rapid overthrow of Hitler can save Germany from partitioning.’

Otto had clearly predicted that Hitler would bring ruin to Germany. However, he probably knew that a domestic revolution was not possible in 1939 Germany, let alone with the handful of sympathetic contacts he maintained. As one scholar puts it:

In November 1942 the Foreign Office could still write the Canadians that “his (Strasser’s) organization seemed to provide to some extent a rallying point for anti-Nazi feeling in a number of countries and as such it may to some extent have served a useful purpose.” Furthermore, he was a Bavarian who demonstrated a deep distaste for Prussians and the old German ruling castes, promising that if he had anything to do with it, they would lose all their power after the war and be severely punished for their shabby role in aiding the Nazi regime and Hitler’s war. Strasser’s own early Nazi activities were willingly overlooked, for he had broken with Hitler and his brother Gregor in 1930, struggled against Hitler since then, and was willing to put his knowledge of the Nazi mentality and character at the allies’ service. Thus he appeared to be well equipped to fight the Nazis and hit their true weaknesses. As a leading Foreign Office official put it in 1941, “We are, and have been using for this purpose (propaganda to Germany) several Germans with whose ultimate aims I totally disagree, but who are thought useful to go on with.” Because Strasser seemed to believe in the “socialist” rather than the nationalist side of Nazism, perhaps Strasser could appeal to the non-Prussian, non-elite members of German society against their rulers. Most importantly, Strasser claimed that thousands of secret Black Front members still existed within Germany awaiting his signal to bring down Hitler through revolt.

There were not, as anyone could tell, thousands of Black Front cells waiting to be activated for the revolution. However, this did not stop the British from assisting Strasser’s exile to Bermuda by arranging transport from Lisbon to Bermuda in 1940 after a series of travails across Europe: Austria and Prague in 1933, and Paris via Switzerland in 1938. Sympathetic Canadian officials then arranged to settle Strasser within its borders, reportedly for “humanitarian” reasons. Shortly thereafter they realized he was a liability who had ceased to be useful to the Allies’ strategy for Hitler and eventually ordered him to cease writing (his primary means of support). He then eked out a pathetic existence on a small farm in rural Nova Scotia, dependent on charity from his brother Paul who was at that time living as a Benedictine monk in the United States. When he finally won repatriation to West Germany in 1955, he re-invented himself as a “Solidarist” (while retaining all of his former beliefs). His last political effort of note was the short-lived party Deutsch-Soziale Union (1956-1962), which failed to field a single candidate.

It is therefore with little exaggeration that we can say Strasser is known to the English-speaking world through his cooperation with Allied intelligence. Without it, Strasser would have had little motivation to write and publish so frequently in English, and possibly would have been captured and executed by the advancing Germans. The phenomenon of a marginal and mostly powerless group which promotes itself to Western governments and NGOs as righteous resistance has not disappeared either—witness, for example, the West’s re-appraisal of the MEK, the cult-like proxy organization that lobbies itself as the most capable opposition to Tehran. With this in mind, Alexander Reid Ross’s dalliances with Western intelligence agencies today appears in an ironic light, given the role of such agencies in advancing actual “creeping fascism.” It was not the Soviet Union which aided Strasser, but liberal, democratic Britain—and had saner heads not prevailed, or if the Western Allies’ conventional warfare from without had encountered obstacles which made internal resistance efforts more plausible, Otto Strasser could have found himself installed as the head of a post-Hitler Germany.

The Reactionary Socialism of Strasserism

From the foregoing we can see clearly how the class origins of the Strasser brothers influenced them toward what Engels, in The Principles of Communism, calls reactionary socialism. Such “socialists” were

…adherents of a feudal and patriarchal society which has already been destroyed, and is still daily being destroyed, by big industry and world trade and their creation, bourgeois society. This category concludes, from the evils of existing society, that feudal and patriarchal society must be restored because it was free of such evils. … It seeks to establish the rule of the aristocracy, the guildmasters, the small producers, and their retinue of absolute or feudal monarchs, officials, soldiers, and priests – a society which was, to be sure, free of the evils of present-day society but which brought it at least as many evils without even offering to the oppressed workers the prospect of liberation through a communist revolution.

As ex-officers, they were identified with the class that led millions to their deaths by tank, machine gun, or chemical weapons, their pretensions to cockaded chivalry increasingly mocked and at odds with the perceptions of average Germans. Ernst Jünger, a writer whose political ideals bear some family resemblance to Strasserism, highlights the disappearance of “honorable” warfare in his dystopian parable The Glass Bees, in which a cunning industrialist replaces the officer corps, and indeed all soldiers, with deadly automatons. Similarly, their petty-bourgeois origins—Gregor a pharmacist, Otto a lawyer—created an instinctive sympathy for their class, squeezed as it was from both sides and fated to disappear, as their Marxist contemporaries reminded them. Their Bavarian faith in Catholicism only furthered their nostalgia for feudalism.

However, it is worth noting the contradictions which led to deviation from this formula. The Strassers wanted a utopian form of feudalism without monarchs or nobles, and opposed hereditary privileges where they actually existed. They also, for the most part, came to despise the Junker officer class which they saw as embodying a kind of aristocratic decadence, wrapped up in the defense of an order which was dying, and indeed must die. Hostility to the Prussian establishment can be partially explained by Bavarian chauvinism, as well as Otto Strasser’s canny appeal to English prejudices during his period of exile. But regardless, this contradiction, in which anti-aristocratic and anti-bourgeois attitudes continually canceled each other out, was resolved by a coalitionist appeal to German workers as a mass base for what was, in reality, a movement for feudalism, in which workers would be “rescued” from their proletarian misery by becoming landed peasants and craftsmen. In reality, theirs was not a rescue mission, but an effort to pin the restless proletariat in place, like insects in a display box. The old feudal mold was to be reshaped and fitted over a re-agrarianized Germany.

Now turning to the Strassers’ primary writings, we see that the feudal character of Strasserite “socialism” is clear and unmistakable. Otto Strasser reveals it explicitly when he writes that “…capitalism is ideologically linked with liberalism, prior to the dominion of which there was an entirely different economic system ideologically akin to socialism, though of course differing from socialism in form.”

The watchword, and main task, of the supposedly socialist and pro-worker Strasserite project, is de-proletarianization. The urgency of this task is justified on the grounds that the proletarian condition is incompatible with independence, and is only made possible by “finding possessions for every German,” to give him “independence of thought and development.” Strasser does not mean by this private property, however, which is to be turned over to collective feudal self-management—for ownership belongs to “the whole of the German people”—but rather the land and tools required for small production.

In order to accomplish this, Strasser proposes the apportioning of land and means of production on the basis of Erblehen, which can be translated as “hereditary fief” or “inheritance loan.” In agriculture, the state’s role is to loan land as usufruct, through peasant councils, which are passed down to male offspring after death, or else are re-allotted if no male offspring can be found. It is worth mentioning that this was implemented as National Socialist policy, if in a more limited form, with the Hereditary Farm Law of September 29, 1933, which had as its goal the preservation of the peasantry through the “ancient German method of inheritance as the blood source of the German people.”

In the case of an industrial enterprise, workers and managers are assigned from their respective vocational councils in fief to a “factory fellowship.” The managers would constitute a “functionary aristocracy” that, Strasser assures us, is much different than a class of capitalists, since it cannot buy shares of any industry, but only inherit their portion from the state. Naturally, the manager’s share of the profits is much lower than that of the workers, since such “copious profit-sharing may foster [an] … overdriving of the means of production and the neglect of improvements.” Agricultural workers were to be converted into peasants, and workers not assigned to “factory fellowships” will join the ranks of petty proprietors, craftsmen, and professionals, who are organized into guilds.

Strasser meets the objection that a return to small production would create massive grain shortages by proposing de-urbanization as a complement to de-proletarianization: urban workers from the cities would be resettled as peasant-producers, particularly along the eastern frontier, while the capital of Germany would be relocated to a small town in the central part of the country; Strasser suggests Regensburg or Goslar (population in 1940: about 40,000). For, Strasser adds, “life in our huge tentacular towns is a danger to the human race.”

To this de-urbanization and de-proletarianization, Strasser rounds out the trifecta with de-centralization. In Germany Tomorrow, Otto Strasser states that administration will be subdivided into 12-14 regions and adds that “the recognition of the necessarily unified character of the German State is not an acceptance of the ideal of liberal unitarism,” and that the German state is “not to be ruled centrally from one spot,” as to reflect the “geopolitical, religious, and cultural differences within the German people.” This reflects the earlier program developed at Hanover, which specifies that only financial and cultural policies were to be pursued uniformly at all levels of government, with all other policies to be implemented at the regional level, comprising 12-14 regions “according to their particular historical and tribal traditions.” As a general rule, the Strasser Program concludes that there should be “division of authority between centralism and federalism with … an organically structure system of corporations.”

This principle of balancing difference with unity by devolving responsibility to the lowest competent strata of authority is known in Catholic circles as “subsidiarity,” and it is likely Strasser, a Catholic, was familiar with it. Strasser’s agricultural policy is also driven by the principle of subsidiarity: the size of farms shall be no larger than one tenant can farm unaided. In industry, Strasser seeks a balance between what he sees as three essential factors: management, workers, and the state. Where capitalism, communism, and fascism make “totalitarian claims” to each factor respectively, Strasser’s German socialism seeks to share the responsibility of industrial enterprise equally among them.

He is quick to emphasize that his system of Erblehen, hereditary tenure, is an “emphatic rejection of any form of state capitalism, euphemistically termed state socialism.” For Strasser, the state is nothing more than the self-government of the national community. He rejects a “national planned economy” if this means the “carrying on of enterprises by the state or its organs,” as this would inhibit creativity, the joy of responsibility, and the cultivation of “mental de-proletarianization”—more so, in fact, than under the “private capitalist system.” German socialism, he says, “gives expression both to a … conservative skepticism of organization and to the popular dislike for bureaucracy.” Strasser reproduces liberal (and anarchist) arguments against Marxism, asserting that “their state” would and only ever could be the rule of the “official class” over the workers.

More shockingly, he—a fascist, and an erstwhile Nazi at that—seems to embrace the same horseshoe theory beloved by Alexander Reid Ross. After citing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Strasser writes:

The fascists and the communists rival one another in glorifying the state, in suppressing economic and personal independence, in unduly extolling power and the successes of organization, of decrees, of planning, and – as a last requisite – the police.

Behold the comic spectacle of a supposed red-brown fascist, making equivalencies between fascism and communism! Toward the end of his life, Strasser was even more unequivocal in his anti-statism, penning the following words in 1965:

Whoever praises and wishes to strengthen the state, he is a fascist; whoever wants to give the state new tools and to make its bureaucracy mightier, he is a fascist.

Moreover, Strasser was not the only fascist to rebuke Hitler for his supposed centralism. We find in Evola’s critique, Fascism as Viewed from the Right, a similar concern for “organic” balance and subsidiarity with regard to the state. For Evola, the ideal regime is not a “legal dictatorship,” but an “authoritarian constitutionalism,” a monarchy which overcomes the “fetish and mythology of … rule of law.” This regime would be “organic and unified” without being totalitarian, and would allow for a “large margin of decentralization.” Liberty and loyalty, autonomy and responsibility, are fixed in a reciprocal relation according to eternal and immutable laws of nature. When these laws are transgressed, the “power that is concentrated at the center … will therefore intervene with a severity and harshness in proportion to the liberty that was conceded.”

The mutuality which Strasser, Evola, et al perceive between possessions and liberty, and between individual freedom and responsibility, are strikingly liberal, as is their preference for a devolved state which strives to balance order and difference. Moreover, Strasser’s distinction between “possession” and private property could have been lifted directly from Proudhon, that most liberal of classical anarchists:

Individual possession is the condition of social life … property is the suicide of society. Possession is within right; property is against right. Suppress property while maintaining possession, and by this simple modification of the principle, you will revolutionize the law, government, economy, and institutions; you will drive evil from the face of the earth.

Such a system would, far from doing away with capital, in fact anchor it more firmly in social existence: “…a system which, better than property, assures the formation of capital and maintains the morale of everyone.”

In fact, many of the features of Strasserism are found in Proudhon, features they share with classical or vulgar liberalism. He denounced suffrage in the name of the self-rule of civil society, sought to reconcile monopoly to small production, exalted war as an immutable and necessary feature of human life, opposed Marxism and communism with a passionate hatred, advocated devolution on the basis of subsidiarity, and was unrepentantly misogynist and antisemitic. These views would in fact directly influence the development of fascism. Drawing upon these reactionary elements of Proudhon (along with Sorel), the “Cercle Proudhon” in the pre-war period gathered together followers of the French fascist Charles Maurras, who rallied against the substitution of “the law of gold for the law of blood.”

It can even be argued that Strasserism was not so divergent from the “orthodoxy” of classical fascism in these respects. The centralism of actually existing Nazism is debated by some scholars, especially those of the so-called functionalist school. Robert Koehl cites a revealing remark by Hitler during a 1933 speech, in which he retorts, to an imagined interlocutor, that there is no one dictator, but ‘ten thousand, each in his own place‘, and adds:

In legislation, in jurisprudence, police practice and administrative policy they tried to substitute men for laws, personal judgment and responsibility for the rule-book and anonymity. They did away with the power of the old constitutional organs like the cabinet and the Reichstag and erected a system of Reichsleiter and Gauleiter whose positions depended, of course, on the Fuhrer’s goodwill and loyalty to them, but also on their ability to get things done and to command the loyalty and respect of their underlings and of the German people entrusted to their care…The oath of personal loyalty to Hitler of February 1934 was exacted precisely because Hitler did not It was the aim of the Nazis to develop both the institutions and the political atmosphere conducive to furthering the exercise of power. Rejecting the modern bureaucratic state with its elaborate channels, they wished to simplify the exercise of power, to pin down the responsibility for decisions, and to encourage independence and aggressive problem-solving. Not strangely, the military analogy seemed to offer a substitute for the bureaucratic state. At least the soldier could always be brought to account by his superior. But here, too, lay a danger that “artificial hierarchies” and “paper structures” would get in the way of on-the-spot action. The solution? Fuhrerprinzip! But the doctrine that a leader must be allowed full freedom to solve a problem meant in effect a neo-feudal system.

Ian Krenshaw, closer to the functionalist camp of interpretation, sums up the NSDAP’s rule in Germany as “feudal anarchy,” where “bonds of personal loyalty were from the beginning the crucial determinants of power.” Hitler parceled out tasks to delegated authorities answerable only to him, with no consideration given to how these authorities might cooperate or communicate with each other. In effect, they were a jungle of competing fiefdoms, vying for the Fuhrer’s approval like puppies at their mother’s teat. It is no accident that Gau, a word with medieval-feudal echoes similar to “shire” in English, was chosen to designate political subdivisions within Germany and its annexed territories. The animating principle of the Nazi state was charismatic authority, which negated any universal, consistent application of procedure. In fact, Nazi policy was “bottom-up” as much as it was “top-down.” Krenshaw cites a speech from 1934 which exhorts underlings to “work toward the Fuhrer” rather than await directions from above. What this precisely meant was ambiguous, and could not be otherwise; this ambiguity provided latitude for those who controlled parts of the Nazi apparatus to pursue their own idiosyncratic objectives or merely empower and enrich themselves, so long as their activities could be posed under Hitler’s aura.

While it is true that Germany under Hitler did centralize some functions, even when it did so, it often merely absorbed private entities without modifying their structure, as it did with charities and mutual aid programs which became part of the Reich‘s social welfare organ (the National Socialist People’s Welfare, or NSV). Moreover, the power allocated to central Nazi authorities was not necessarily seen as conflicting with self-government at the Gau level. Wilhelm Stuckhart, a secretary with the Reich Interior Ministry, asserted in 1941 that an “organic synthesis” between these two modes of organization was possible. He proposed what one author calls a “totalitarian subsidiarity principle,” which would delegate responsibilities at the lowest strata of government which could plausibly accept them, thereby reducing the burden of the higher-ups.

This “totalitarian subsidiarity principle” is a hallmark of the Strassers’ plan for the “second revolution,” as they called it. Nor were they alone in seizing on some form of it. Perhaps nobody elaborated this subsidiarity principle more than Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton, who together championed a petty-bourgeois, feudal-religious ideology known as distributism. It has already been mentioned that Otto Strasser met G. K.’s cousin, A. K. Chesterton, in Ireland in 1955. It cannot be confirmed whether he was therefore also familiar with G. K. Chesterton, or with the works of Belloc, but nonetheless, there are striking similarities between Strasserism and distributism. The ur-text for distributism is perhaps Belloc’s The Servile State, a plea for the conversion of all classes into petty proprietors and small landowners. F.A. Hayek praised it in Road to Serfdom for explaining “more of what has happened since in [Nazi] Germany than most works written after the event.”

In this work, Belloc compares the proletariat to a patient whose limbs are atrophied from disuse. “Collectivists,” Belloc‘s term for Marxists and social democrats, are like a doctor who counsels this patient to accept his condition. Those, however, who like Belloc seek to “re-establish property as an institution normal to most citizens” are like a doctor who prescribes to this same patient exercise and physical therapy. Possession of property appears as a vital principle, necessary for freedom of movement, indeed literally analogized to arms and legs. This society of small proprietors that Belloc calls the Distributive State is essentially a society which existed once before, in the feudal era. He describes it as:

..an agglomeration in which … stability … was guaranteed by the existence of co-operative bodies, binding men of the same craft or of the same village together; guaranteeing the small proprietor against loss of his economic independence, while at the same time it guaranteed society against the growth of a proletariat. … The restraints upon liberty were restraints designed for the preservation of liberty; and every action of Medieval Society, from the flower of the Middle Ages to the approach of their catastrophe, was directed towards the establishment of a State in which men should be economically free through the possession of capital and of land.

By “co-operative bodies” Belloc means the medieval guilds, in which competition between members, and between apprentices and masters, was checked and held in place; but also the “cooperation” between serf and lord, who both had a mutual stake in, and ownership over, productive land holdings.

In Belloc, Proudhon, and the Strassers we find an intermingling of feudal-reactionary and petty-bourgeois—liberal rhetoric. We find similar themes surrounding so-called “Prussian socialism,” developed by the likes of Oswald Spengler and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Moeller van den Bruck, who originated the concept of the Third Reich, and whom Otto Strasser calls the “Rousseau of the German Revolution,” saw Prussian socialism as a continuation of Bismarck’s Empire, whose statecraft rested upon a project of permanent order, which would “put revolution beyond the bounds of possibility.” Yet, as Domenico Lorsurdo points out, Bismarck was not hostile to liberalism, or at least what Marx and Engels called “vulgar liberalism.” Bismarck, Losurdo says, reacted to waves of worker unrest by making “…a profession of liberalism [against those who would] interfere in the relationship between masters and servants and hence to ride roughshod over the principle of self government by civil society, hegemonized … by feudal property.” Bismarck acknowledged two kinds of liberalism:

The first was characterized by ‘repugnance at the power of bureaucracy’, on the basis of ‘liberal caste sentiments’ widely diffused among the Junkers and nobility of pre-revolutionary Prussia; the second, utterly odious in Bismarck’s view, was ‘Rhineland French liberalism’, or the ‘liberalism of civil servants’ (Geheimratsliberalismus), inclined to incisive anti-feudal reforms from above, which inspired an oppressive, suffocating state bureaucracy with its ‘tendency … to levelling and centralization’ and even ‘bureaucratic omnipotence’ (geheimrätliche Allgewalt).

Returning to Moeller van den Bruck, we find that he took fault with Marxism for precisely what Ross and others claim offers a Trojan Horse for fascism, its emphasis on class. Prussian socialism should be the advocate for the justice of nations, not classes, for “men can only live if their nations live also.” Rather than Hitler’s expansionist ultranationalism, the Strassers interpreted this nation-first socialism to mean the creation of a United States of Europe which would reconcile the contradiction between the chauvinism of national and regional particularities, and the consciousness of belonging to a broader civilization, of a European identity.

We find this idea present in the Strasser Program of 1925, which seeks to create a “United States of Europe as a European league of nations with a uniform system of measurement and currency” It is elaborated in Otto Strasser’s Germany Tomorrow, where he envisions his New Germany as the crown jewel of a European Federation, with a universal currency much like the current EU, although he suggests using the Swiss franc. He also calls for reciprocal disarmament after the conclusion of the war, culminating in a supranational European army. Even more strikingly, he includes other features already implemented in the European Union: free movement and the abolition of customs barriers. Such proposals for a European Federation, or a proto-EU, coming from a figure on the far right should not be surprising: Oswald Mosley, Francis Parker Yockey, and Jean Thiriart also proposed pan-Europeanism that would make Europe a third superpower to rival the US and the Soviet Union.

Needless to say, this is not anything like proper internationalism. A justification for such a united federal Europe is that it would solve the “colonial problem,” which meant not the striving of colonial nations for liberation and self-determination, but the competition among European nations for the spoils of the periphery. He proposes a collaborative European administration of all colonies and a power-sharing scheme in which nations which have no colonies receive them in proportion to those of established imperial powers. This scheme involves the creation of a “European Colonial Company,” jointly managed and funded by non-colonial powers in proportion to their population. This “enlightened” European chauvinism is the meaning of the Strassers’ supposed anti-imperialism, which has been falsely likened to Leninist support for national liberation movements in order to “prove” a red-brown connection.

Misinterpretations and Misunderstandings

Having provided a historical investigation into the actual content of Strasserism, we can now provide a picture free of tendentious misinterpretations. Strasserism is not the right wing of social democracy, nor does it exhibit crossover with anti-imperialist, “top-down,” and/or anti-liberal strains within Marxism. The crossed hammer and sword of the Black Front’s flag with its pseudo-revolutionary red and black, may be an attempted claim to the legacy of revolutionary worker movements, but it is not a genuine one.

What has happened is this: the distortion field of social media has led a particular clique of “red-brownism” Cassandras to “discover” within the annals of fascist mutation—or, more probably, Wikipedia—a cudgel against a counter-clique of self-professed “normie socialists.” We grant that this counter-clique, centered around a prickly defense of bread-and-butter social reforms, deserves harsh critique. But generally, the fulcrum of this critique has not been their opportunism, which by framing voter opinion (real or imagined) as the horizon of possibility, denies proletarian intervention in, and rupture with, the current bourgeois order and its political economy.

Instead, the hyperbolic use of “Strasserism” aggravates this opportunism by embracing popular frontism, enlisting liberals as allies against edgy Berniecrats. At the same time, it obscures the true nature of fascism by reverse-engineering the thesis of “social fascism,” formulated by Stalin as the “moderate wing of fascism.” It is ironic, given the anti-“tankie” orientation of anarchists like Alexander Reid Ross, that this combination—popular frontism and the designation of social democracy as “social fascism”—folds into a single synthesis the zigzagging course of Stalinist opportunism.

But where the Third Period Comintern’s critique of “social fascism,” according to Nicos Poulantzas, stemmed in part from an “economistic perspective, which led it to undermine the importance of political and ideological factors,” the thesis of “red-brownism” is that Strasserism, and fascist creep, is a temptation of any class-centered socialism. By rejecting both trade-unionism and social democracy on the one hand and Leninism on the other, these authors are driven by their own logic toward the activist-liberal NGO complex as the only solid and unassailable base from which to combat fascism.

We should not look for the true nature of fascism in faulty categories such as “totalitarianism,” which serves bourgeois interests by making the left and right ends of the horseshoe meet in their resistance to liberalism. Neither should we look for it in tasteless humor, callous memes, or critique of identity politics (however lacking in nuance). Even outright chauvinistic views on the left, while obviously condemnable, do not ipso facto belong on the fascist spectrum. The true nature of fascism, rather, is organized by a mobilization against the revolutionary subject of history—the proletariat. Because fascists understand, if hazily or even subconsciously, that class struggle is the motor of progress, this mobilization rallies around a reactionary utopia which would plug this motor, once and for all, through a double movement: first a cancellation of those conditions already existing which supply its fuel, and then to re-crystallize a stable order in which no forward motion is possible. Insofar as the fascist seeks to demolish the rotting timbers of the old order, they call themselves revolutionary, but this is only to rebuild upon a solid and permanent foundation. From the precipice of destruction, they rescue the threatened petty bourgeois and install them as supporting columns, consecrated by holy invocations—locality, heredity, duty, and all the values whose chain of transmission was interrupted, if not severed, by the train of changes which industrialization and an upstart bourgeois left in their wake.

More precisely, the fascist seeks through force and seduction to absorb the proletariat back into the soil, reversing the uprootedness which creates her relative indifference and detachment from occupation. In fact, the proletariat has no occupation; for it is only through the proletariat that labor itself becomes truly general, a “means to create wealth … [which] has ceased to be tied as an attribute to a particular individual,” to which we may add the particularity of land and race. As Engels puts it, the emergence of the proletariat coincided with the cutting of the “umbilical cord which still bound the worker of the past to the land.” This explains, for instance, the Strassers’ obsession with medieval craft guilds. As Marx writes in The German Ideology:

The patriarchal relationship existing between [journeymen] and their masters gave the latter a double power—on the one hand because of their influence on the whole life of the journeymen, and on the other because, for the journeymen who worked with the same master, it was a real bond which held them together against the journeymen of other masters and separated them from these. And finally, the journeymen were bound to the existing order by their simple interest in becoming masters themselves.

This quintessential feature of the proletariat, its alienation from the specific and particular which provides its labor with the stamp of universality, is why the proletarian cannot help but act outside of any closed identity, including that of the “worker.” The figure of the worker as conjured by proponents of “normie socialism” is perhaps the strongest connection to the logic of fascism, although it does not legitimate the label of “Strasserite.” This label has been applied to them, in part, for their hostility to identity politics, but it is, in fact, their own practice of identity politics—workerism—which at all carries the kernel of truth in the Strasserite libel.

This aspect of fascism, the negation of the proletarian condition as such, does not require a centralized state or hostility to individualism and liberalism. Spengler’s characterization of the rootless proletariat as the fourth estate, a formless mob of “nomad-like masses,” is a species of panic over the “massification” of society shared by liberals like Ortega y Gasset. To the dialectic of historical materialism, which sees individuals and society reconciled to each other in communism, the fear of mass society sets up a false dialectic whose opposite poles inevitably move toward each other. As Ishay Landa observes, the individual “comes first when confronted with mass society; but society will come first, when confronted with the demands of mass individuals.” This oscillation which we find in the liberalism of a Gasset or a Herbert Spencer is inherited by fascism. Thus the mass character of total war is accepted as a solution for “liberal” individualism, while the perfection of the individual through racial Darwinism becomes a solution for mass society.

Strasser, though a militarist and a racist, came to reject these “Hitlerite” solutions while proposing his own oscillation. He sought to engulf the mass individual, the proletariat as such, in a caste system instantiated by guilds and hereditary land holdings, and thereby make him into a cell of the social organism. Yet he cannot entrust to a “totalitarian” and “bureaucratic” state the management of this process, because with Bismarck, Proudhon, and Belloc, such a state inevitably creates a servile mass society, since its administrative decrees—which possess a universal and leveling force—ride roughshod over the peculiarities of culture and geography which create the “true”, “organic” individual.

There is a further contradiction. If the Strassers, in the Strasser Program, could claim to be republicans against “hereditary monarchy” and advocate the expropriation of princes, how can they then appeal to the feudal institutions which arose under hereditary monarchy—guilds, fiefs, and the like?

De Maistre provides a clue in Considerations on France. Here, while reflecting on the fact that it is the providence of God which alone determines the rise and fall of nations, he comes against an obvious objection: was not the French Revolution therefore according to the will of providence? De Maistre concludes that, yes it was, and for the reason that the ancien regime carried within it a weakness which God punished by the sword of revolution. However, he writes, it is here where “we can appreciate order in disorder,” for the ancien regime fell only so it could be raised again, purged of all faults. This is the “great purification,” as he calls it; the “French metal, cleared of its sour and impure dross, must become cleaner and more malleable to a future king.”

Charles Maurras, whose brand of fascism owes greatly to de Maistre and the counter-revolutionary tradition in France, carries over his argument, but supplants the will of God with that of Nature. Monarchy, a “regime of flesh and blood,” is thoroughly natural, but is threatened by something like a principle of “anti-nature,” a principle of the “infinite and absolute” which the philosophes and revolutionaries of the Enlightenment wielded as weapons against the old “natural order.” If a new monarchy is to be established that can withstand such weapons, it must partake of them in a limited way. Maurras saw the Catholic Church as this sort of synthesis of the natural and absolute, saying that the solution “is to be found in the establishment of terrestrial authorities whose task it is to channel, reactivate, and moderate [the] formidable intervention of the divine,” as Catholicism does. Therefore the new monarchy, to ward off its attackers, should be invested with the imprimatur of the divine; in essence, it should be raised to a monotheism. Here we can perhaps compare the remarks of Bukharin cited earlier, that fascism seeks a “speedy reorganization” of the ranks in order to generate a more durable, and absolute, order.

So it is with the Strassers. Otto writes that “every sustaining stratum … must comply with the demands of the time.” . As the French nobility was slower to realize this than the English nobility, they fell before Danton, where the English nobility did not fall before Cromwell. The Prussian Junkers, being such a “sustaining stratum,” also failed to heed the demands of the time. As large landowners, they were social allies of the big factory bourgeoisie, and so together were the enemies of the shrinking petty bourgeoisie of the small farms and the Mittelstand. For Strasser, it is not monarchy as such which is raised to a monotheism, but organic self-rule of the national community as mediated through petty proprietors. This once existed in Christian, feudal Europe, but this state of affairs contained in it the poisonous seed of monopoly, whether in land or industry. To raise it again, and fix it permanently, therefore required the sacrifice of both the proletariat and the Prussian elites.

Finally, arriving at Strasser’s foreign policy, with its European federalism and rhetorical opposition to ‘militarism‘, we find no principled support of national liberation, but the same obsession with a stable and natural order transfigured and purified by the so-called second revolution. It is the same “anti-imperialism” of paleoconservatives, and their offspring in the alt-right, which opposes war only insofar as it mingles populations and disrupts the natural boundaries of the national community. It was not the stirring of independence in the colonies which roused Strasser’s sympathy, but the antagonism between imperialist nations. A united Europe should rule over the periphery together in harmony and cooperation; maintaining the colonies in this way would preserve order, as abolishing the proletariat would preserve order, since their independence would mean the expansion of open class struggle to a global scale.

While not exhaustive, this treatment of Strasserism is sufficient to put to rest any notions that it was a synthesis of right and left, let alone that it was a reactionary workers’ movement. The Strassers attempted to seduce workers into abolishing themselves for the sake of a new feudalism, plying them with false sympathy. If the actual course of Nazism unfolded like the plot of Alien, with incomprehensible monsters from other worlds preying openly on its vulnerable victims, Strasserism is the titular villain from It, beguiling and entreating the proletariat from the gutter—where it devours them.

Beyond Left and Right in Silicon Valley

The scope of this essay may seem excessive; after all, Strasserism is ultimately a marginal niche, even within the far right, and its recent reincarnation has come in the form of a pejorative for a politics that, as demonstrated, does not merit it. But by turning the logic of Strasserism inside-out, we can see revealed a rational kernel: that the proletariat and the threat of progress are linked together in the perception of the right. Of course, it is undeniable that the proletariat is not the only victim of fascism. But it is possible that racism, or at least genocidal racism, is not essential to fascism. In fact, with this kernel as our guide, we can see that the real left-right alliance may have been misidentified. It may be brewing within the very center and heart of neoliberal ideology—Silicon Valley.

In 1995, Richard Barbrook already identified a reactionary strain within the emerging professional subclass of computer engineers, programmers, and visionary digital entrepreneurs, which he termed the “Californian ideology.” He finds here a fusion of the new left, represented by the rhetoric of anti-consumerism and the liberation of desire through hippie-like tech gurus (think Burning Man), with the free market absolutism which, in that era, was adopted as the GOP brand. For the members of this rising “virtual class,” the market was a natural force that, if not altered, could empower them to become entrepreneurial titans, their heads far above the clouds of society’s laws, with the freedom to innovate as they saw fit—while becoming fabulously rich in the process.

Today, there are a plethora of such titans, and their influence is immense. Some, like Elon Musk, have cultivated a cult following online, while others, like Peter Thiel, prefer to manipulate events behind the scenes. Schumpeter foresaw entrepreneurs of this type, ascribing to them the “dream and the will to found a private kingdom … the nearest approach to medieval lordship possible to modern man.” For each entrepreneur that has ascended to the ranks of lordship, however, there are thousands still climbing, and many more who have failed. Prior to the Trump era, some of these strivers and losers went on to develop the ideology known as the “Dark Enlightenment” (or NRx for short). Nick Land, whose affiliation with NRx is long-standing, summarized the thrust of this ideology with a statement by Peter Thiel, delivered at a 2009 Cato Institute meeting: “Freedom and democracy, Thiel believes, are no longer compatible.”

“Democracy” in this case signifies a kind of bribery, in which politicians “buy” the votes of the masses with false promises of equality. Liberty, or rather a bourgeois parody of liberty, suffocates beneath the weight of the mob as they rush headlong toward anyone who can promise them free goodies. Hans-Hermann Hoppe, appropriately the author of Democracy: The God That Failed, is explicit in identifying the extension of this democracy into the economic sphere with socialism.

Already we can see that this critique resembles the fear of mass society, as mentioned earlier. Confronted with this mass society, we see Barbrook’s “virtual class” turning to an exaltation of hierarchical individualism, embodied by the entrepreneur. But inevitably, this fear of mass society turns into the fear of mass individuals, and so we see again the turn toward an integral community which can absorb these mass individuals back into a functioning whole.

Curtis Yarvin, better known by his pen name Mencius Moldbug, proposed precisely this. In a series of blog entries, he lays out his plan (in aggravatingly periphrastic prose) for a form of state which would swallow up the masses and spit out responsible and obligated citizens. He begins with the nationalization of all financial assets, public companies, and banks. This is the “left” element of the left-right synthesis. Moldbug then takes a step right: this nationalization is not public ownership of the means of production, however, but a new feudalism. Simply put, this new state would be a joint-stock corporation, with citizens as shareholders—literally. Citizenship would be tied to the amount of money in their portfolios. For homeowners, the state would buy out their home equity, turning them into renters, with the state as landlord. Then, the state triples the portfolio amount. If you were wealthy, you are now three times as wealthy; if you own no assets, three multiplied by zero is zero. However, all debt would be bought back by the state, as a kind of debt jubilee.

Moldbug realizes that this plan cannot be implemented under the current government; in so many words, it requires a one-party state. But not the one-party state of Hitler and Stalin—conveniently, these are “totalitarian democracies,” and democracy is clearly bad. His argument rests on the assumption that division of authority, rather than shrinking the size of government, enlarges it and makes it less accountable: “Big government is big because it is constantly competing with itself.”

This scheme would accomplish the same goals as that of the Strassers, a society of petty proprietors, but using libertarian market ideology as a halfway house for fascism. In fact, one plank in the Strasser Program is eerily similar to Moldbug’s joint-stock state. It states that all business employing over twenty-one employees will be converted to joint-stock companies, of which roughly half of all shares will belong to the public.

Since Moldbug shuns electoral “bribery,” his plan is dead in the water. However, others are not so dogmatic. Moldbug’s proposal to triple the portfolios of shareholder-citizens echoes the advocacy of universal basic income by Silicon Valley oligarchs, from Musk to Gates to Zuckerberg. These proposals for UBI are premised on the reality of increasing automation, which will unleash mass unemployment and create an immense strata of surplus population. Since this surplus population would be hypothetically locked out of employment, they would be unable to purchase consumer goods, setting off a crisis of underconsumption. UBI would convert this surplus population into lumpen-consumers, while at the same time excusing the dismantling of social protections guaranteed by the welfare state. Since it offers a “floor,” but no “ceiling,” and is distributed flatly without regard for pre-existing wealth (hence universal), it is a gesture of noblesse oblige from a neoliberal oligarchy, much like Plan Moldbug’s debt jubilee.

Of course, the surplus population is a subclass within the proletariat, insofar as they belong to that class which subsists only on its labor power, differing only in that there is no buyer to sell it to. But as Peter Frase points out in Four Futures, the surplus population is, for this reason, a toothless proletariat, since they are locked out of the struggle at the point of production. Some may leave the proletariat and join the ranks of the precariously self-employed, in the so-called gig economy. But it is possible that most may not, and so a “world where the ruling class no longer depends on the exploitation of working-class labor is a world where the poor are merely a danger and an inconvenience.” . Available options for reducing this danger range from increased policing and harassment to elimination, through neglect or more direct means.

The Trump era has accelerated a crisis of liberalism which renders most neoliberal UBI candidates unviable. One candidate, however, has broken through the noise. Andrew Yang’s meme candidacy exploited a loophole in the Democratic Party’s 2020 procedures for getting on the primary debate stage: 65,000 individual donors and you’re in. Yang met this threshold, and received a significant boost by disillusioned elements of Trump’s coalition, mostly nihilistic NEETs who realized that his administration hadn’t improved their lives in any tangible way—nothing so tangible at least as a free thousand bucks a month, or what Yang calls the “Freedom Dividend.” Whether they are sincere or merely bored is mostly moot. Some claim—again, with varying degrees of sincerity—that his promise to address opioid addiction, and his alarm about declining birthrates, is a dogwhistle for white nationalism. Yang summarizes his platform as “Human-Centered Capitalism,” mixing in now-standard social democratic expansions like Medicare-for-All with crankery like a circumcision ban (another dogwhistle) and year-round daylight savings.

Yang’s ideology is as plausibly red-brown as that of the DSA “Strasserites.” It remains to be framed in such a way, in part because of its aesthetic presentation, but also because Yang supporters do not engage in polemic with the likes of Alexander Reid Ross. Moreover, he has no plausible path to nomination. Yet it is obvious Yang represents a new and potentially popular synthesis, a mix of neoliberalism and social democracy with populist packaging. His recent book is appropriately titled The War on Normal People. Returning to Bismarck and his counter-revolutionary reforms, this book quotes him as saying “[i]f revolution there is to be, let us rather undertake it, not undergo it.” Yang ominously adds: “Society will change either before or after the revolution. I choose before.”

As communists, we can only hope that this choice is left to the proletariat, the foundation of all revolutionary hopes.

Stephen Moore, Trump’s recent appointment to the Federal Reserve Board, has served as the American Legislative Exchange Council’s (ALEC) leading voice for austerity and anti-labor policies for over a decade.

ALEC is a pay-to-play operation where legislators and corporate lobbyists meet behind closed doors to establish policies on issues that affect our lives, such as the environment, energy policy, and workers’ issues. Moore currently serves on ALEC’s “Private Enterprise Advisory Council” and the Board of Scholars. Since at least 2009, Moore has regularly attended the meetings where corporations script state policy.

Moore’s most well-known work with ALEC, “Rich States, Poor States” (RSPS), is one of the flagship documents supporting a conservative agenda in the states. For twelve years, Moore has co-authored the report, which serves as ALEC’s state scorecard for Koch-backed policies aimed at reducing taxes on the wealthy and corporations and suppressing wages.

ALEC’s RSPS report “provides a recipe for economic inequality, wage suppression, and stagnant incomes,” as well as for austerity for public infrastructure and education systems which “are the true foundations of long term economic growth and shared prosperity,” wrote economist Peter Fisher in a joint Good Jobs First and Iowa Policy Project report.

Moore now faces confirmation by the US Senate, which is expected to be a turbulent process, as he is widely considered unqualified to hold a position that would make him one of America’s most powerful officials for economic policy.

Ties to The American Legislative Exchange Council

Moore has spoken at ALEC conferences every year since at least 2013. He was a featured speaker at ALEC’s 40th Annual Meeting; a keynote speaker at the 2014 ALEC Annual Meeting; he “talked ideas and policy” at the 2015 ALEC States and Nation Policy Summit; he had a “terrific time with dedicated state legislators” at an ALEC event in 2016; was on an ALEC panel in 2017 and promoted coal at the 2018 ALEC conference and answered questions about RSPS on a panel.

ALEC claims Moore is one of the “most well-respected free-market economists in America,” while Moore states “it is a great privilege” to be associated with ALEC. “Don’t you just know we are doing the right thing at ALEC, when we have these lunatics protesting against what we are doing?” Moore once said, presumably speaking of the multiple workers’ rights and environmental rights groups that protested the 2015 States and Nation Policy Summit in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Moore’s speaking engagements have predominantly focused on RSPS, which ALEC calls its “economic outlook of states.” Moore is frequently called to ALEC meetings to discuss the yearly report he and his co-authors — ALEC Chief Economist Jonathan Williams and Reagan-alum economist Dr. Arthur B. Laffer — research together.

Expert Reviews of Rich States, Poor States

ALEC’s flagship report has been derided by experts as “silly,” “highly misleading,” and the “gold standard in bogus economic policy claims.” As the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) reported in 2015, RSPC “slaps a fresh coat of paint on the flawed fiscal and economic austerity policies favored by the group and its corporate patrons.”

Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, reviewed ALEC’s RSPS reports and concluded that the data did not back-up ALEC’s claims. The “bottom line,” according to Chinn’s findings, is that the ALEC rankings are “not correlated with real [gross state product] growth, either short term or media term.”

Chinn told CMD that the conclusions of the 2015 econometric assessment are still likely true today and that he agrees with the conclusions of Good Jobs First and the Iowa Policy Project in their 2012 report on ALEC’s deeply flawed methodology. According to that report, “Selling Snake Oil to the States,” ALEC’s RSPS “consistently ignores decades of published research making broad, unsubstantiated claims and often using anecdotes or spurious two-factor correlations that fail to control for obviously relevant factors.” RSPS relies on a “methodologically primitive analysis that any student taking Statistics 101 would be taught to avoid,” the report concluded.

Moore often uses migration numbers as people “voting with their feet” as evidence for their economic policy preferences. But Chinn says that this method of analysis is fraught as it does not control for many factors at play. Marshall Steinbaum, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, called Moore’s premise of people moving from blue states to red states “some sort of fantasy.”

RSPS “embodies the policy agenda that ALEC pushes to state legislators” according to the Iowa Policy Project’s “Grading of the States.” That site was created by Fisher, an economist who is currently the Research Director at Iowa Policy Project, to cover business climate rankings. Grading of the States says despite ALEC’s claims that “these policies promote economic growth and prosperity, the evidence shows otherwise.”

Kansas is one data point of the evidence Grading of the States mentions. As CMD reported in 2016, ALEC-backed policies in Kansas have resulted in a widening of the income inequality gap “by shifting income to the state’s wealthiest taxpayers and corporations, while suppressing wages and cutting services for the middle class, low-income children, and veterans.”

Moore’s Background

Despite praise from ALEC claiming “no one is more qualified than Stephen Moore for this position,” Stephen Moore would be alone on the Federal Reserve Board as the only member without a doctorate degree. Moore has never worked within academia. And, as pointed out by Chinn, Moore has never been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Instead, Moore has climbed the ranks within conservative think-tanks and political groups. He founded Club for Growth, and has worked as a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a senior economic contributor at FreedomWorks, a board member of the Donors Capital Fund, a research director for President Ronald Reagan’s Commission on Privatization, and with many other right-wing organizations.

“Stephen Moore is little more than a fairly inept polemicist. I’ve never seen anything written by him that could be construed as ‘research’ in an academic/policy sense,” Chinn told CMD. Pointing at his lack of a doctorate in the field, Chinn opined, “perhaps he has an excuse, given his limited economics training,” but Moore’s “use of incorrect or outdated data suggests deeper issues.”

Economists Say Moore Is Not Qualified

Moore “is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad pick. He hasn’t gotten a thing right in twenty years,” Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, tweeted.

Wolfers is not alone. Greg Mankiw, a Harvard professor who was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush and is considered a “leading Republican economist,” said Moore “does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job.”

Moore himself said, “I’m kind of new to this game, frankly, so I’m going to be on a steep learning curve myself about how the Fed operates, how the Federal Reserve makes its decisions,” according to Bloomberg. “It’s hard for me to say even what my role will be there, assuming I get confirmed.”

Trump also recently appointed “former pizza magnate turned failed Republican presidential candidate” Herman Cain to the Fed. However, according to ABC News, Cain is expected to withdraw his name from consideration in the coming days after four GOP senators indicated they would not vote to confirm him. The next step in the confirmation process is vetting from the Senate Committee on Banking, chaired by Idaho Republican Mike Crapo.

After years of development, BioWare finally launched Anthem earlier this year to a wave of critical and community backlash. BioWare's next big thing didn't seem like it had it all together, leaving fans to wonder where the six years of dev time went. The answer was offered earlier this month when Kotaku's Jason Schreier published a fairly lengthy report on Anthem's development. The report noted a lack of directorial vision, several mechanics changes, and of course, issues with the Frostbite engine.

The latter has been a common problem at Electronic Arts studios. The last few BioWare titles-Dragon Age: Inquisition, Mass Effect: Andromeda, and Anthem-all had problems utilizing Frostbite during development. For fans, the engine has become a scapegoat for recent problems in EA franchises, from Need for Speed, to FIFA, to the Star Wars games. The perception is that Electronic Arts is forcing all of its studios to use Frostbite, which is borne out by nearly every EA title switching to the engine But some development leads have countered that belief.

"It was our decision," former BioWare general manager Aaron Flynn told Kotaku Splitscreen in regard to using Frostbite for Dragon Age: Inquisition. "We had been wrapping up Mass Effect 3 and we just shipped Dragon Age 2 and we knew that our Eclipse engine, that we shipped DA 2 on, wasn't going to cut it for the future iterations of Dragon Age. It couldn't do open world, the renderer wasn't strong enough, those were the two big ones. We thought about multiplayer as well, as Eclipse was single-player only."

But even if developers have taken on Frostbite willing, it has definitely caused some major issues across Electronic Arts studios. So it's worth looking back at the rough road that got the engine to where it is today.

What is an Engine?

Let's establish in rough terms what an engine is. It's software-development infrastructure that allows people to build video games. An engine is what developers craft their games on top of, providing them with several development necessities like a renderer, audio, scripting tools, artificial intelligence, animation, and physics simulation. It's a toolbox, allowing a developer to quickly to get to core of game development, rather than reinventing the wheel and rebuilding these tools from scratch. A good example is the old Infinity Engine games: BioWare made the engine for Baldur's Gate, but Black Isle Studios was able to use the Infinity Engine, skip that stage of development, and roll right into crafting the world and narrative of Planescape: Torment.

These days, many developers can turn to robust general engine like Unreal Engine, Unity, CryEngine, or MonoGame. These engines require development effort in order to make them do exactly what a studio wants, but they also have huge communities of other developers who are doing the same thing; there's a shared expertise that developers can draw on. Many of these engines also make it easy to port your finished game over to different platforms like PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and even mobile.

Developing your own engine from scratch can be a much costlier affair, since you're building a framework from the ground up. The difference here is a bespoke engine can be directly tailored to your game, while a general-purpose engine is a jack-of-all-trades. There's also the issue of licensing fees. If you're using Unreal Engine, you pay 5 percent of your revenue to engine developer Epic Games when you ship your game. The additional cut taken by digital storefronts and other middleware can add up, lessening the actual profit a developer sees. With an in-house engine, you're not paying anyone; and if you stick to a certain genre, you're likely to have an engine that can roll forward from game-to-game.

Major publishers are keen to not pay licensing fees, but their handling of their own engines vary. Ubisoft has been rather successful with its handful of in-house engines: AnvilNext 2.0 powers Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, and Ghost Recon Wildlands; Snowdrop has been used for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and The Division 2. Capcom had its MT Framework and currently uses the in-house RE Engine for Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 2, and Devil May Cry 5, while also licensing Unreal Engine for Street Fighter 5 and Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite. EA has tried to follow in their footsteps, but Frostbite hasn't been the one size fits all solution that it might have hoped.

The promises of Frostbite 3 | Electronic Arts

Electronic Arts Moves to Frostbite

Electronic Arts used to have several studios that each utilized their own engines. The engines didn't always have keen names because they were just what the games were built on. The real shift began all the way back in 2006, when EA acquired Digital Illusions Creative Entertainment (later known simply as DICE). DICE had developed the successful Battlefield series (Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2, and Battlefield 2142) for EA, and the publisher wanted to bring them further into the family.

DICE was beginning work on Battlefield: Bad Company, a game that wasn't aimed at the PC like previous Battlefield titles. Instead, Bad Company was coming to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was also the first game that would use Frostbite. Instead of building a new engine for each game, Frostbite would carry from game to game for DICE, improving with each iteration. By 2011, DICE was releasing Battlefield 3, which looked fantastic and showed off the power of Frostbite 2.

At the time of Battlefield 3's release, EA had a host of major franchises all using their own engines. EA Labels president Frank Gibeau wanted all the studios to get on the same page.

"Frank Gibeau, myself and others said that this has to stop; this has to get a unified platform because it's too expensive and inefficient for everyone to be operating off of different engines," former EA chief design officer Patrick Soderlund told Engadget at the time. The idea was to show the other EA studios how awesome Battlefield 4 looked, and point to Frostbite 3 as the reason. According Soderlund, BioWare and Need for Speed developer Ghost Games were the first to reach out about using Frostbite for their titles. Not everyone was up for switching to Frostbite though: EA Sports was about to switch to the Ignite engine for its 2013 releases, and third-party studios like Respawn Entertainment stuck to engines they were used to, like Valve's Source engine. Still, EA believed heavily in Frostbite.

"If you look at the magnitude and complexity of a Battlefield game-using Battlefield 4 as an example-you can see that you can build pretty much everything with this engine to a very, very high quality," said former EA DICE general manager Patrick Bach at the time.

The Troubles Begin

Seemingly, the major issue with Frostbite is that it was an engine built for a specific purpose: first-person shooting and multiplayer. The problem is manyEA games obviously aren't first-person shooters: BioWare builds RPGs, Ghost Games makes racing games, and Madden and FIFA are sports sims.

For Dragon Age: Inquisition, BioWare had to create a dialogue system within Frostbite and make an animation system for dogs and horses, but Frostbite could only animate bipedal creatures. For Need for Speed Rivals, Ghost Games had to rework Frostbite's streaming system to accommodate the speed at which its cars could move.

"You can drive around our world indefinitely, and that's something that wasn't without its teething pains, but now that it's in and working, it's a really powerful thing that any open-world title is going to be able to use moving forward," Need for Speed Rivals senior producer Jamie Keen told Engadget.

"We started with a really solid foundation of the engine but we had to build a lot around it," said BioWare producer Cameron Lee about using Frostbite on Dragon Age: Inquisition. "The concept of save games didn't exist, at least as Bioware knows them. The tactical camera, just being able to pause a game and still work within it, Frostbite didn't have that, it had no concept of that. We've had to add all of these things to it over the course of our development over the last four years. We built all of these different tools for the engine."

The idea was that all this knowledge could feed back into Frostbite, creating a general purpose engine for all of Electronic Arts. It's an excellent idea, but not one that has gone off without a hitch.

Dragon Age Inquisition was technically BioWare's second foray into Frostbite. | Electronic Arts

BioWare Hits The Skids

BioWare worked on another project prior to starting on Dragon Age: Inquisition, code-named Blackfoot. It was a multiplayer-focused Dragon Age, but it really was a way for BioWare to get used to Frostbite. The studio knew that The engine would provide challenges, but it needed a way to see how deep the well went.

"Frostbite doesn't really understand the idea of stats or items or saving a game, conversations, cutscenes. Like a bunch of things that we take for granted it doesn't even really conceptualize. We actually had a project code-named Blackfoot which was the first game we had that was looking at Frostbite. That became the core of what became Dragon Age Inquisition, the techlines, more than any of the development, so we've actually been looking at this a long time," said Inquisition executive producer Mark Darrah told GamesIndustry.biz back in 2014.

Implementing basic RPG features took a very long time in Frostbite. BioWare was working hard to build one of the biggest games it had ever crafted, partially inspired by Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, while working with an engine not built for RPGs. It was like pulling teeth.

"I had to get to the conversation in-game, open my tools at the same time, and then as soon as I hit the line, I had to hit the pause button really, really quickly," Inquisition cinematic designer John Epler told Kotaku's Jason Schreier for his book, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels. "Because otherwise it would just play through to the next line. Then I had to add animations, and then I could scrub it two or three times before it would crash and then I'd have to start the process all over again. It was absolutely the worst tools experience I've ever had."

Worse, DICE was updating Frostbite with new features because the engine was being used for a host of games. So BioWare's developers were grafting new things onto an engine that was changing underneath them.

"There'd be times when the build wouldn't work for a month, or it was unstable as hell. Because the new version of the engine would come in, the tools team would start doing the integration. All the while, the team is still working and moving ahead, so it gets worse and worse and worse," Lee told Schreier.

Towards the end of development though, BioWare and DICE synced up better and Dragon Age: Inquisition started to come together. It finally launched on November 18, 2014, becoming one of BioWare's best-selling games. Frostbite had proved difficult to handle, but ultimately engineers at BioWare and DICE made it work. And those features who help in future BioWare games. It seems logical that all the work BioWare did for Dragon Age: Inquisition would flow right into Mass Effect: Andromeda. They're both RPGs, right?

Mass Effect: Andromeda could be a looker. | Electronic Arts

Lost on the Way to Andromeda

BioWare Montreal, the team behind Mass Effect: Andromeda had big dreams. They wanted a title that would allow players to explore a galaxy of vast, procedurally-generated planets. It was supposed to fulfill the promise of the first Mass Effect, utilizing new technology.

Frostbite was missing features, but Inquisition was wrapping up when Andromeda went into pre-production, so the latter title was getting some of the features it needed. The problem was the outline for Mass Effect: Andromeda was actually a much bigger project than even Inquisition. Andromeda's maps were supposed to represent entire planets, so they needed to be bigger than even Inquisition's vast spaces, and Frostbite wasn't equipped to handle that.

"Whenever you're trying to do something that fits the engine-vehicles, for example-Frostbite handles that extremely well. But when you're building something that the engine is not made for, this is where it becomes difficult," one developer told Kotaku.

"It's been painful," said another. "The pain started with Dragon Age: Inquisition and continued on with Andromeda as well."

Mass Effect: Andromeda began pre-production in 2013, but by 2015 BioWare Montreal was cutting out the concept of procedurally-generated planets. Ultimately, due to this lack of direction, BioWare Montreal had to scramble to create the final version of Andromeda, most of the work coming in the last 18 months. And Mass Effect: Andromeda didn't fully right the ship prior to launch. Instead, it had a host of bugs and poor animations, leading to poor reviews and a bad reception in the community. Ultimately, BioWare Montreal was shuttered and merged in EA Motive.

The pain of what Mass Effect: Andromeda could've been, and what it was, lingers for some developers. One developer, Andromeda designer Manveer Heir, pointed to Frostbite as one of the big issues during the game's development.

"Frostbite is easily the worst, shittiest, most pain in the ass engine I've ever used in my career, and I shipped Wolfenstein off the Doom 3 tech," said Heir on Twitter. "The exact same game design in Unreal vs. Frostbite will take dozens more engineers, money, and time on FB because of the way its architected and how far behind it is from Unreal (unless you are making BF). There is a reason I chose Unreal Engine 4 as my engine for my next project."

Sadly, Ragtag is dead and buried. | Electronic Arts

The Ragtag Group Loses

While Dragon Age: Inquisition was wrapping up, EA acquired the exclusive license to make video games based in the Star Wars universe. The first title on the docket was Star Wars: Battlefront, a first-person shooter built by EA DICE, based on the older games developed by the defunct Pandemic Studios for LucasArts. Star Wars: Battlefront looked great thanks to the ongoing work on Frostbite, but fans hit it for a lack of depth and longevity.

As EA Dice was working on Battlefield 1 and a sequel to Star Wars: Battlefront, Dead Space and Battlefield:hardline developer Visceral Games was working on its own Star Wars title. The studio had hired Uncharted creative director Amy Hennig to make a grand Star Wars adventure, centered on the dirtier side of the universe. This was Project Ragtag.

The problem was again, that Project Ragtag was meant to be a third-person action-adventure game, not a first-person shooter. Frostbite didn't have all the tech needed to make it easy to craft the kind of game Visceral wanted. Like BioWare, it took twice as much effort to make things happen.

"We obviously had to take the Frostbite Engine, because there was the internal initiative to make sure that everybody was on the same technology, but it was an engine that was made to do first-person shooters not third-person traversal cinematic games," Hennig told USG earlier this year. "So building all of that third-person platforming and climbing and cover taking and all that stuff into an engine that wasn't made to do that. We did a lot of foundational work that I think the teams are still benefiting from because it's a shared engine, but it's tough when you spend a lot of time doing foundational stuff but then don't get to go ta-da! [laughs] You know, here's the game."

As the project dragged on at Visceral Games, Electronic Arts ultimately decided to shut down the studio. It moved what was Ragtag over to EA Vancouver, refocusing the linear action-adventure into an open-world one. Ultimately, Electronic Arts cancelled that game as well, leaving the only Star Wars releases from the publisher being Star Wars: Battlefront, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, and the upcoming Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The latter game is being built by Respawn Entertainment in Unreal Engine 4.

Without Frostbite, there'd be no Longshot. | EA Sports

EA Sports Are Complicated

From 2013 to 2016, EA Sports was using its own in-house Ignite engine to power all of its sports titles, including FIFA, Madden NFL, and NBA Live. With the releases of FIFA 17 and Madden NFL 18, those titles have switched over to using Frostbite as their primary engine. With the move to Frostbite came the addition of new cinematic story modes—Madden NFL's Longshot and FIFA's The Journey—which developers have said is all because of the new engine.

"I had met with their people and actually pitched this idea to all of the EA Sports teams this crazy idea of Longshot, and I had been pitching a campaign mode for sports. I'm pretty sure without Frostbite we really couldn't do it, and that's one of the things that held us back from trying to execute this thing, and they were getting Frostbite first. In the meantime, I think they were seeing some of the other sports franchises go down this path and have some success. So I think everyone will assume that Madden saw The Journey's success and followed in its footsteps, but we've had our own path to get to this point," Madden NFL 18 creative lead Mike Young told USG.

Young pointed to Frostbite's excellent content engine and shaders for allowing the Madden NFL team to build out a cinematic storytelling experience in a way it couldn't with Ignite. Everything didn't go off without a hitch though. Madden NFL 18 was a transition year: it looked better, but it missed some of the cleaner features and smoother motion players had come to expect from the Ignite Maddens. EA Sports introduced Real Player Motion in Madden NFL 19, a new animation system intended to make the on-field action feel real, but once players had it in their hands, they noticed the bugs and freezes. Even the Frostbite FIFA games have had complaints about choppy pacing and input lag.

NHL 19 holds onto the Ignite engine. | EA Sports

"There are often some bits and pieces left behind," Madden NFL 19 gameplay lead Clint Oldenburg admitted to USG. "You're not really aware it ever existed until it gets into Frostbite, and when you start playing the game you're like, 'Wait this thing's not working. Oh man we forgot the motion system.'"

Despite the two key sports titles making the move, not every EA Sports franchise has switched over. NBA Live 19 and NHL 19 still use Ignite, while EA Sports UFC 3 uses the all-new RPM Tech engine. NHL's steadfast hold against Frostbite has been noticeable to the community, and according to the developers, that's because they don't want to lose features in the transition to the new engine.

"Really, we have so much invested in what's built in Ignite. And right now we feel that we don't really want to go into a transition year where... well, in our last transition year, a lot sort of had to be left on the cutting room floor, right? We didn't deliver to our fans expectations and so right now we've got a critical mass of different modes where people are investing in them, they're playing them. They want Threes. It runs in the current engine. We built our customization in it and so, right now, we're trying to deliver to more fans expectations. I'm not sure that transitioning to Frostbite right away would actually deliver what our fans expect," explained NHL 19 creative director William Ho to USG.

NHL 19 was a give-and-take though. When USG's Kat Bailey took a look at this year's entry, she found a game that captured the speed and excitement of hockey, with very dynamic crowds, but it was also lacking the visual prowess in the players themselves, something that might be down to the older engine. Of course, FIFA 19 looks like the real sport visually, but ultimately isn't that fun to play. Finding out the correct direction for all of its franchises is an ongoing struggle for EA Sports.

I mean, Anthem does look fantastic... | Electronic Arts

Dirge, Not an Anthem

In the meantime, Andromeda might have been a big pothole for BioWare, but fans still had hope. BioWare's massive next-gen game was finally revealed in June 2017 at E3. It was called Anthem, and featured players going up against a massive untamed environment in exo-suit called Javelins. BioWare had been working on Anthem since 2012; it was using Frostbite, but surely the work on Dragon Age: Inquisition and Mass Effect: Andromeda meant that Anthem would be fine.

Not really. The same problems that plagued Andromeda resurfaced here. BioWare didn't quite know what Anthem was during development, and while some of the systems could be ported over from their previous games, Anthem was firmly a multiplayer online experience. There's not much connection between the types of games Anthem, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Mass Effect: Andromeda are. So again, BioWare had to craft new features within Frostbite and again, it wasn't a pleasant task.

"It's hard enough to make a game," one former BioWare employee told Kotaku. "It's really hard to make a game where you have to fight your own tool set all the time."

Different game, same story. BioWare began to cut back on planned features for Anthem, like real-time weather, because trying to get them working in Frostbite was taking forever. One developer said it can take "a week to make a little bug fix". Getting some of the ideas working in Frostbite required as much work as making a new engine.

...sadly, they need to work on the gameplay. | Electronic Arts

"Part of the trouble was you could do enough in the engine to hack it to show what was possible, but then to get the investment behind it to get it actually done took a lot longer, and in some cases you'd run into a brick wall," a BioWare developer told Kotaku. "Then you'd realize, 'Oh my god, we can do this only if we reinvent the wheel, which is going to take too long.' It was sometimes difficult to know when to cut and run."

Worse, engineers within EA's Frostbite team were spread thin. If every game is using Frostbite at your publisher, then you need to spread that expertise around. The Frostbite team was helping with FIFA, because that made a ton of money for EA, so BioWare's Anthem team trying to find time to sync up with them was hard. BioWare had little help, things kept changing with the game's design, and implementing these new changes in Frostbite was very time-consuming.

Like Mass Effect: Andromeda, Anthem launched to a critical drubbing, worse than BioWare's previous game. Mass Effect: Andromeda lowest Metascore is 71, while Anthem's is 55. Regardless, BioWare is continuing to push forward, improving Anthem where it can. And the studio is still working on another Dragon Age, though that project was cancelled at one point to get Anthem out the door. Will this be the project where BioWare and Frostbite finally come together in a beautiful whole?

Not all of Electronic Arts' problems are related to Frostbite though. Ghost Games has shipped three Need for Speed titles, all built in Frostbite. The biggest EA Sports games are developed on Frostbite, and while they do have some issues with play feel, the developers are seemingly still onboard.

Electronic Arts as a whole could eventually get to the place management wants, a robust engine that can be shared across all developers. But for fans, it can be hard to look at the company's most recent and upcoming exciting games, Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and notice neither is developed in Frostbite.

Deaths after surgery in Scotland have dropped by more than a third, research suggests.

A study indicated a 37% decrease since 2008, which it attributed to the implementation of a safety checklist.

The 19-item list - which was created by the World Health Organization - is supposed to encourage teamwork and communication during operations.

The death rate fell to 0.46 per 100 procedures between 2000 and 2014, analysis of 6.8m operations showed.

Dr Atul Gawande, who introduced the checklist and co-authored the study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, said: "Scotland's health system is to be congratulated for a multi-year effort that has produced some of the largest population-wide reductions in surgical deaths ever documented."

Prof Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director, added: "This is a significant study which highlights the reduction in surgical mortality over the last decade.

"While there are a number of factors that have contributed to this, it is clear from the research that the introduction of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in 2008 has played a key role."
Andrew Yang can’t quite believe he’s running for president. On a chilly Wednesday night at Boston Common, he’s speaking to a crowd of more than 500, the kind of audience most outsider candidates would kill for. His staff has primed the crowd to respond, telling us to cheer “math” when he talks numbers and leading us in a three-beat cheer. “An! Drew! Yang! An! Drew! Yang!”

When Yang gets on the bandstand, he seems to find the whole thing sort of funny. “Chant! My! Name!” he yells back. “Chant! My! Name!”

There’s an iRobot engineer holding a “humanity first” sign

Yang has been campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination all year, but audiences like this have only started to show up in the past couple weeks. The tipping point was an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast in February. It was a deep, analytic, two-hour interview, which is catnip for Rogan’s Reddit-centric audience. Yang’s pitch was simple: automation is destroying American jobs, and we need a president with some kind of answer. If you believe that, the robot-obsessed startup guy could be your only option.

Yang’s answer looks a lot like socialism, although he doesn’t use the word himself. The centerpiece of Yang’s campaign is a $1,000 monthly check to every person in America, paid for with a Nordic-style Value Added Tax. That’s normally called a basic income, although the Yang campaign calls it a “freedom dividend,” since focus group testing found the idea was more popular in the language of corporate ownership. Left-wing think tanks like the Roosevelt Institute and Data for Progress have been pushing a basic income for years as an alternative to the current labyrinth of federal aid programs, but Yang is the first presidential candidate to build a campaign around it.

The Boston crowd is mostly techies and earnest college kids. I catch a few whiffs of weed but nothing unreasonable given the venue. An iRobot engineer is holding up a “Humanity First” sign. (“People say immigrants are taking the jobs,” he tells me, “but really it’s me.”) Farther back, a man named Joe is selling bootleg Yang2020 hats, copies of the “vaporwave” hats used in Yang memes. According to his Etsy store, he’s made 10 sales online, with at least two more made in person at the rally.

In the eastern corner, a group of four visibly libertarian stragglers is gathered by a green, vaguely fascist Kekistan flag, one of 4chan’s many in-jokes. One holds up a Shepard Fairey-style portrait of Thomas Jefferson bearing the caption “I want YOU to end the Fed.” I present as a reasonable, sympathetic listener, and they seem genuinely surprised when I say the flag makes me nervous. When I first saw it, I thought they might be some obscure group of Irish Nazis.

“One guy got furious about that!” the larger libertarian says, not believing I could make the same mistake. “He got in my face and said, ‘This guy’s a fascist!’” He does a pantomimed finger-point, showing me how intense and unreasonable the man had been. “Come on,” he continues. “It’s a piece of cloth with some stripes.”

In the background, Yang is laying out the imminent threats to retail work, already half-crushed by the juggernaut of Amazon. “Unfortunately, the most common job in the United States is working in retail,” Yang says. He’s kicking into numbers mode, but there’s no pause and it’s hard to tell if we should be chanting “math” or not. The average retail worker makes less than $11 an hour, he tells us, and there are millions. “So when 30 percent of malls and stores close in the next four years, what is her next move going to be?”

This isn’t an applause line, and the crowd isn’t sure what to say. One man near me yells out weakly, “Die?”

“I have a very particular approach to things. There are problems, and there are solutions.”

Normally, a politician would be rousing here, angry, but Yang barely raises his voice. Like a good businessman, he acts like his feelings are beside the point. He’s coming back to the core pitch now, picking up momentum. “The first time you heard about me and the $1,000 a month you probably thought, ‘That sounds fantastic but it’s too far out,’” he tells the crowd, coming into the home stretch. “But then they think, ‘Wait a minute, he’s talking a lot of sense. Cars and trucks are going to drive themselves. AI is going to do a lot of the work. My mall did just close. Donald Trump is our president. I do have a supercomputer in my pocket. He is Asian.’”

There’s some laughter there, but he’s too wound up to slow down for it.

“And all this stuff starts clicking in their minds and they’re like, ‘Holy crap… He’s right… We should totally give ourselves $1,000 a month.’”

One on one, Yang’s self-deprecation makes more sense. He comes off like a fun boss, ready to make a few jokes to keep people listening, but quickly jumping back to the language of a pitch deck. When I ask him about his unusual rally style, he acknowledges it, but he has a hard time thinking of it as anything but the natural thing to do. “I have a very particular approach to things,” he says. “There are problems, and there are solutions.”

The business-minded approach makes sense: until recently, Yang was firmly on the executive track, moving from Phillips Exeter to Brown to Columbia Law, starting one company and serving as senior management in a string of others. In his 2018 book, The War on Normal People, he attributes his success to his ability to be “very good at standardized tests” — a weird brag, but a skill that ultimately put him in charge of the test preparation startup Manhattan GMAT. In 2009, the company was acquired by Kaplan, a huge windfall for anyone holding stock. He was 34.

He was gripped by two nagging questions: “What is happening to America?” and “Why am I turning into such a tool?”

Yang stayed on as CEO after the acquisition, but the flush of money set the stage for his next move. He had been troubled by all the young graduates going into banking or corporate law as a default, then growing disillusioned with their new careers while smaller cities withered for lack of ambitious young people. He imagined “an army of smart, enterprising graduates building businesses in Detroit, New Orleans, Providence, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, and other cities that could use a boost.” In 2011, he donated $120,000 of his own money to start Venture For America (VFA), an accelerator meant to build new startups and new jobs in emerging cities outside of coastal startup hubs.

Arriving at a moment of tech-fueled optimism, VFA was a hit, earning Yang the title of “Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship” from the Obama White House and a spot on the thought-leader circuit. Conferences and ideas festivals were eager to present VFA as a new hope for devastated regional economies, a way to solve social problems with the familiar tools of entrepreneurship and venture capital. That circuit came with immense opportunities, a chance to raise funds by peddling hope to the rich and powerful. At the same time, Yang was shaken by the social disintegration he saw in the cities VFA was trying to help. Detroit was still dying, and more cities were joining it each year, collapsing into drug addiction, poverty, and despair. The world of TED Talks and cocktail parties didn’t seem capable of doing anything about it — himself included. In his book, he says he was gripped by two nagging questions: “What the heck is happening to the United States?” and “Why am I becoming such a tool?”

The numbers show us losing everything that makes us human: our intelligence, our sense of purpose, and our will to live

When I ask Yang about that period, his frustration starts to show through. “Imagine being this celebrated entrepreneur,” he says, “and then feeling like your work is like a wall of sand in front of a tidal wave. And people keep asking, ‘How did you build the wall of sand?’”

“One of the things I pride myself on is a degree of intellectual honesty,” he continues. “So then if you say, ‘I honestly do not believe that I am solving the problem doing the work that I am doing,’ then you have to go to the drawing board and say, ‘How would I solve that set of problems?’”

The set of problems has hardened into a set of bleak statistics about America, which Yang summons up at a moment’s notice. The story starts with economics: The top 1 percent of earners have accrued more than half of US income growth over the past decade. Only 63 percent of Americans are actively engaged in full-time work, a number that’s stayed flat since 2014 while the nominal unemployment rate has plummeted. 62 percent of Americans say they wouldn’t be able to cover an emergency medical bill of $1,000 or more. One of Yang’s favorite statistics is that persistent financial insecurity lowers a person’s IQ by 13 points, making us more impulsive, less creative, and angrier.

That financial desperation is already destroying lives. For the first time in over a century, US life expectancy has declined for three years running, driven by a rise in opioid overdoses and suicides. A 2017 paper explored an unusual spike in the death rates of white men between 50 and 55, who had become 5 percent more likely to die from alcohol, drug use, or suicide since 2000. (Morbidity researchers classify these as “deaths of despair.”) Taken together, the numbers show us losing everything that makes us human: our intelligence, our sense of purpose, and, finally, our will to live.

Behind all of it, Yang sees automation, driven by the unstoppable will of the market. The story starts with the decline of American manufacturing, something politicians are used to talking about. But Yang thinks that decline is driven less by globalization and more by automated assembly lines, which have allowed the sector to maintain roughly the same output levels as 2007 while dropping nearly a million jobs. In a few years, self-driving freight trucks will follow, unlocking tens of billions of dollars for investors and displacing millions of truck drivers, to be followed shortly by cab drivers, clerks, service workers, and radiologists. There will be no profit motive to reintegrate them, no training program that can make their skills valuable again. Yang predicts an epidemic of depreciating human capital hitting profession after profession until society disintegrates, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of human despair.

“The end state looks unthinkably terrible.”

It’s grim, with obvious echoes of Marx (who was writing about automation too). But where Marx saw a struggle between discrete classes, Yang sees a tidal wave hitting group after group in sequence. In his reading, no one is safe and we’re all in it together. “Relying on the market is going to get more and more destructive as it zeroes out more and more people,” he says, “unless we come together and build a different kind of economy as fast as possible. And the first concrete step in that direction is to give everyone $1,000 a month in cash.”

That unremitting bleakness has led some of the more rabid online fans to name Yang as the “chaos candidate,” a title previously held by Donald Trump. It’s an “accelerationist” idea, working from the premise that the present society cannot be saved. For accelerationists, the most humane course of action is to bring about collapse as quickly as possible, like ripping off a Band-Aid, to prepare for the next societal order.

I explain the idea to Yang, who seems to be hearing it for the first time.

“That’s highly interesting,” he says. “Is there a view of what that end state looks like?”

I tell him it’s hazy at best.

“My choices are to watch the society come apart or try and galvanize energy around meaningful solutions.”

“Because to me, the end state looks unthinkably terrible,” he says, loading up the mental cache of numbers again. “Even now, we have an epidemic not just of drug overdoses, but of anxiety, depression, and mental health problems. If you load pervasive financial insecurity and scarcity on top, you will have a population that starts dying younger, is less rational, does not know what to do.”

He is looking off to the side in concentration now, his voice still low but more forceful. “People think Donald Trump is a problem. No, Donald Trump is a symptom of this ongoing transformation,” he says. “The path from here to figuring it out is fraught with a lot of misery and suffering. And right now, our political feedback mechanism in this country is breaking down... So the accelerationism idea, it might be satisfying, but do we really want to sit around and watch our society come apart?”

A politician’s sincerity is always in doubt, and Yang is more doubtable than most. This is his first campaign, his first venture in electoral politics of any kind. Before 2017, he had no history of anti-capitalist activism. It’s easy to paint him as a vanity candidate who is indulging in fashionable socialism to build his thought-leader credentials, like a smarter, more detail-oriented Howard Schultz. But describing this collapse in person, Yang seems genuinely shaken and moved to do something — anything — to stave off the collapse. If his campaign comes off as doomed or absurd, it’s simply because he didn’t know what else to do.

“That is literally what drove me to run for president,” Yang says. “I thought to myself, realistically, my choices are to watch the society come apart or try and galvanize energy around meaningful solutions.”

When I visit the Yang campaign in March, it’s in the middle of a fundraising tear, with more than $2 million raised including high-profile donations from Jack Dorsey, Noah Centineo, and Nicolas Cage. But the campaign still does most of its work out of a small office in New York’s Garment district, sharing the floor with a math-tutoring business and at least three fashion companies. One corner of the office has become a make-shift supply closet, stacked with coat hangers, tripods, brochures, and “Yang2020” bumper stickers.

It’s the deputy campaign manager’s second week on the job and another staffer’s second day. The new bodies are sorely needed: the campaign is still unwinding from a visit to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, where Yang had spoken alongside Eric Holder, Tom Perez, and Stacey Abrams. He’d arrived with only one campaign worker, which the team realized too late had left no comms staffer to hand out business cards and make connections with potential supporters and donors at the event.

“Once we secure the bag,” the caption reads, “I can quit my job and rap about Harambe.”

Online, the landscape seems more favorable. Yang’s CNN town hall was announced just a few days earlier, and the meme crew quickly noted it would be on the same day as the return of Game of Thrones. The campaign’s digital director Andrew Frawley saw the chatter and started thinking about how to play off it, something that would get some viral lift. What if they put Yang on the Iron Throne, with a caption, “The Robots Are Coming”? There is an Iron Throne at the HBO Shop in Bryant Park, just a few blocks west. It would be easy enough to get a Jon Snow-style fur coat to drive the point home. Campaign manager Zach Graumann nixes the coat as off brand. Does he really need a photo at all? Photoshop would be faster and more authentic, and lots of online supporters are happy to do some quick cut-and-paste work on behalf of the campaign. The final product arrives a few days later on Yang’s Instagram and Twitter accounts, presenting the town hall and GoT premiere at 8PM and 9PM, like a two-hour doubleheader.

If that seems corny, it’s nothing compared to most of the Yang memes out there. A turn through the #YangGang Twitter tag shows a crying MAGA-hat Wojak finding comfort in a vaporwave Yang hat and a $1,000 bill. Another shows a blunt-smoking Elon Musk, with ghostly overlays of Harambe (a beloved gorilla slain by zookeepers in Cincinnati) and a Bombay Sapphire bottle. “Once we secure the bag,” the caption reads, “I can quit my job and rap about Harambe.”

If you’re under the age of 25, your first awareness of Andrew Yang probably came from an image like this, dropped in a Discord channel or a Reddit thread. For reasons that seem unclear even to the campaign, Yang has become the meme candidate. Most of the memes revolve around the promise of $1,000, simple enough to be the punchline at the bottom of an image macro.

By now, people make Yang memes because they’ve seen Yang memes. Some outsiders wonder if the campaign is secretly behind the meme explosion, but Frawley tells me he has little to do with most of what’s out there. Still, they do what they can to boost the good ones. The campaign merchandise is full of meme-y in-jokes, including Bitmoji bumper stickers of Yang’s face and tote bags reading “Secure the bag,” all boosted through the campaigns official accounts.

Frawley is skeptical of Facebook, seeing it as useful mostly for reaching an older audience, and only when the campaign is willing to pay. Most importantly, it’s not where Yang’s young supporters are spending their time. “Most of our under-35 reach out is Twitter and Facebook,” he says. “It’s really Boomers and Gen-X that have embraced Facebook.”

Sometimes, when you put an idea into the world, you lose control of what it means

Sometimes, the enthusiasm goes somewhere uglier. 4chan’s /pol/ board seized on Yang after the Rogan interview too, and some of the subsequent memes were shot through with anti-Semitism, showing Jewish bankers and other gleefully racist /pol/ cartoons. When I first wrote about the racist memes, Yang was quick to push back, telling me frankly, “for anyone with this agenda, we do not want your support.” But the trolls haven’t been so easy to shake. Weeks later, the campaign scrambled to cut ties with a far-right podcaster who had worked his way onto the Michigan volunteer staff. At CNN’s town hall, the moderator told Yang straight out, “White nationalists are supporting you online,” even as he tried to distance himself. The next morning, a tweet tagged as “#YangGang for #SystemCollapse” showed the candidate Photoshopped into a Nazi salute, with anti-Semitic slurs and clown-wigged Pepe frogs pasted below. Soaked with toxic irony, it was hard to tell if the tweet was attacking Yang or supporting him.

This tornado seems to have caught the campaign off-guard, but it didn’t come out of nowhere. An outsider candidate, Yang has embraced outsider media. That approach started with the Rogan appearance, but it carried over to later interviews with Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro, both of whom often walk the line between earnest skepticism and neo-reactionary racism. In one campaign video, Yang uses his usual matter-of-fact tone to describe the shrinking of the white population, driven by declining birth rates and the raging opioid crisis. This logic can be a dog whistle to white nationalists, a signal that someone secretly shares their view that the white race is under attack.

When I tell Yang that, he is alarmed. “I never really set out to talk to a specific group,” he says. “This is going to have an impact on all of us.”

Sometimes, when you put an idea into the world — or, more specifically, the internet — you lose control of what it means. Yang has succeeded so far by throwing out as many new ideas as possible: not just basic income, but federal marriage counseling, campaigning by hologram, backing off on medical circumcision, implementing new nuclear launch fail-safes, seemingly anything he decides is a good idea. It’s a conscious break from the narrow, unimaginative grind of professional politics. But campaigning is about people as much as ideas, and the right idea can sometimes come with the wrong people. And then, sometimes those people Photoshop a joint into your mouth and caption it “Yang Weed…Gamers Rise Up.”

The day after the rally, Yang is back in New York, meeting with staff. We’ve arranged a photo shoot in the campaign’s new office space. It’s two floors above the main office and completely bare, rented out to accommodate the rush of incoming staffers.

Yang is tired, but he’s in a good mood. He’s been watching a documentary about disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who visited the Obama White House with Yang in 2012 as a Champion of Change. A few interviewers have asked him about Holmes, and he hasn’t been sure what to say. “Some people are odd and impressive,” he says. “She just seemed odd.”

Yang has surged ahead in the polls. The most recent numbers put him at 3 percent, tied with Julián Castro and ahead of party favorites like Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. He’s eighth in a field of twenty, and Nate Silver, icon to political professionals everywhere, has gone on record saying, “We actually can’t discount the possibility that Andrew Yang will just grow and grow and take the whole thing.” The campaign likes the quote so much that they print it out at poster size and tape it to the wall.

“Are you pulling my leg?”

The main elevator is out, so when we’re finished, we take the freight elevator to back down. Waiting outside, one of the other tenants, an older man with gray hair and a heavy New York accent, sees the camera equipment and asks what’s up. We say we’re taking photos of Mr. Yang.

“Who’s Mr. Yang?”

“I am,” says Yang.

This only makes the man more confused. A staffer pipes in that Yang is running for president.

“Of the United States?”

We assure him that it’s true. He knows most of the tenants, but, of course, the campaign is new, and something doesn’t seem to be clicking. He knows about the primary race, surely, but this guy in front of him just doesn’t seem like the type. There’s a pause. He seems worried he might be on some kind of hidden-camera show, roped into a gag he doesn’t yet understand.

“Are you pulling my leg?”

“We’re trying to get the word out,” Yang says, as amused as anyone. “Watch CNN on Sunday. You’ll see.”

Another pause. “For president?”
A resident of the Wyndford estate in Glasgow, Scott Carroll was cut off from central heating over the winter after a spell in hospital with pneumonia – but he’s now finding his feet with the tenants’ union

LAST month, Scott Carroll had to walk home in the rain from hospital with pneumonia, with no money for public transport.

When he got home to his flat in the Wyndford estate in Maryhill, he applied to the council for a crisis grant to get the heating turned back on.

Told it would take three days to process this request and directed to homeless accommodation, he finally broke down.

This was the culmination of a hard few months for Scott. Living with both physical and mental health problems while unemployed was trial enough before a letter reached his flat at the start of winter.

Speaking to CommonSpace, he says: "I got a bill in, £1800. I can't pay that. I phoned them up, wasted an hour just getting moved from pillar to post.

"Since September, I've had no heating right through the winter. I've got a lung condition, suffer mental health problems and I'm unemployed.

"It had a detrimental effect on my mental health, having no heating."

"I've got a diagnosis for emphysema. It can't be cured but it can be treated. I'm on all sorts of medication, inhalers and the rest; I'm like Boots the chemists."

Scott, who moved to the Wyndford flat in 2013 after the death of his mother, had used his own resourcefulness to get by.

"I'm a survivor," he says.

"I got started at a gym, I washed at the gym and kept healthy and fit."

But these efforts couldn't protect him from deteriorating health. In the freezing nights, he slept with two jumpers on and in a sleeping bag. It was that morning his lungs failed him, and he was taken to hospital.

"I woke up and I couldn't breathe. They took me to hospital. I had a slight touch of pneumonia.”

Combined with the emphysema, Scott summed up his situation as “no looking to good for me”.

“But I'm a survivor," he repeated.

Today Scott is in better morale.

"I've been paid today. I'm happy today, I'm warm, I'm with good people," he says.

His financial position is less desperate, but he has also found new purpose, campaigning with the tenants’ union in his estate, against the conditions he has faced and he knows so many others have in the climate of austerity across Scotland.

"People are dying from underlying health problems and coldness, hypothermia," he says.

Scott’s story is just one to emerge during the campaigning work of tenants’ union activists in the Wyndford estate in recent weeks.

The union is organising against the impact of changes in the Wyndford District Heating System (WDHS) introduced in 2012, and today serves around 1800 of the Wyndfords 1900 households. The union says key meters for heating were phased-out in December 2018 and that many residents are now receiving their new quarterly bills.

Anger is focussing on the payments, which some residents feel is too high. The standing charge for heating is 44p per day, but SSE, the energy company in charge of the WDHS scheme, has recently announced it will rise to 48p per day.

Nick Durie, a member of the Wyndford Tenants Union (WTU) - which was previously the Wyndford residents association before joining forces earlier this year with Living Rent, Scotland's tenants union - told CommonSpace: "It's a burning hot issue in the scheme and we've been doing a lot of door chapping about it."

Below – Tenants’ union members campaigning against heating standing charges in the Wyndford

In addition to organising a petition against the standing charge, WTU has held a surgery for tenants and a strategy meeting at which Scott helped devise the idea of a video bringing together people in the community to discuss the problems with the heating scheme.

Durie said their doorknockers had already met another five tenants disconnected, and more with huge debts, and widespread confusion as to how such large debts have been amassed.

The union already has successes under its belt. In 2013 its predecessor organisation won a low user tariff, so that some lower income tenants would pay no standing charge.

Today they are demanding an end to the standing charge, accountability from the housing association and energy company and the right to return key meters for residents who want them.

They are also demanding Scott’s debts be cleared and for his flat to be placed on the low user tariff.

Scott says that he feels more empowered now that he is active in the union.

"My mental health is a bit brighter, it doesn't just happen overnight.

"I don't know if it's luck or fate that brought us together. I feel as if my Mum's looking down on me. I thank God for this day."

CommonSpace asked SSE about Scott’s case. They responded: "We would urge any customer facing difficulty with their heating bills to contact us as soon as possible and we can help. We would never disconnect a customer who had been in contact with us to say they were struggling with a bill and making attempts to contribute to a debt repayment plan.

"Customers, or anyone concerned for a friend or family member with any vulnerabilities, should make this known to Cube Housing Association and/or us and we can ensure they are supported.

"Like other businesses, we’ve seen a sustained increase in inflation. Raising the standing charge is not something we do lightly but unfortunately, like other suppliers, we’ve had to pass this through to customers."

And asked whether they will meet with residents and the union to address concerns, SSE said: "We’re in regular dialogue with Cube Housing Association, Bob Doris MSP, Citizens Advice Scotland as well as individual customers and will continue to engage with all parties."

A spokesman for the Cube Housing Association said: "We’re doing everything we can to help tenants on the Wyndford estate who have been disconnected or are threatened with disconnection for not paying their bills. This includes encouraging them to engage with the energy company, set up a payment plan and making sure they are receiving all of the benefits they’re entitled to claim.

"As part of this ongoing involvement, we also check on whether a tenant is vulnerable and alert the energy company if this is the case, which prevents disconnection.

"We are always here to speak to any customers who are struggling or who have any concerns about their bills – we will do all we can to help."

Oliver Luck was on the DA Show on CBS Sports Radio Tuesday just before the New York head coach press conference. Damon Amendolara focused a lot on the demise of the AAF, including the Tom Dundon and Vince McMahon conspiracy theory. They also dived into XFL topics like player salary’s, rules and when the Los Angles Head Coach/GM announcement will be.

Notes from the Interview;
Elizabeth Warren's campaign has grown to double the size of her Democratic rivals who are bringing in millions more in donations, raising questions about whether the Massachusetts senator will be able to garner enough small-dollar financial support to sustain her Boston-based operation through the long primary season.

By the end of March, Warren's campaign staff numbered about 164 people, according to payroll spending released this week in a quarterly Federal Election Commission disclosure. The 69-year-old candidate, who was the first major contender to jump in the race with a New Year's Eve announcement, now has a team of more than 170 people and plans to bring on new hires every month in the second quarter of 2019, campaign officials confirmed.

Early on in the race, more than nine months before primary voting begins, those figures make Warren's salary and payroll expenses significantly larger than those of her main rivals. FEC reports show that she spent more than $1.7 million on payroll and payroll taxes and fees.

As Warren and her advisers see it, it's part of a larger strategy that diverts from past presidential campaigns that have prioritized spending on television ads. As voters change the way they consume information online, they say, Warren has focused on building a campaign operation in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, holding events (58 town halls in 14 states) where the emphasis is on answering questions (more than 250 from audiences), engaging with the press (105 one-on-one interviews and 44 media availabilities), and demonstrating substance on policy.

“We are building a grassroots organization that’s built to last,” said Kristen Orthman, the campaign’s communications director. “We have front-loaded a tight-knit team and set our organizational plans, priorities, and culture faster and in finer detail than anyone.”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is leading early Democratic primary polling among declared candidates and raised more than $18 million in the first quarter, has built the second-largest campaign staff — with 86 people and more than $832,000 in payroll, according to a spokesperson.

The figures do not include payments to consulting firms.

Warren, who has released a bevy of detailed policy proposals and is maintaining a busy travel schedule to states that kick off the Democratic primary in February and March, raised more than $6 million in the first quarter of 2019, but spent $5.2 million, according to her campaign. It's a high burn rate for a top contender. Candidates hope to bring in more money than they are spending, particularly this early in the race.

Warren has made a point this year of swearing off the sort of high-dollar fundraisers she has held in past statewide races. Because of a transfer of $10.4 million from her Senate campaign account earlier this year, she began the second quarter of the year with about $11 million in the bank — a war chest that past presidential candidates who flamed out from high early spending never had to fall back on.

Still, the rest of the Democratic field is operating with campaigns that are far smaller than Warren's or Sanders'. FEC reports show that in the first quarter of the year, Cory Booker spent more than $890,000 in payroll on 62 staffers; Kirsten Gillibrand spent more than $867,000 on 43 staffers; Kamala Harris spent more than $706,000 on 44 staffers; John Delaney spent more than $673,000 on about 50 staffers; and Beto O'Rourke spent more than $161,000 on roughly 30 staffers.

Of the top-tier candidates, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had the smallest operation in the first quarter, with about 10 people and just $156,000 in payroll spending, though in the weeks since the Afghanistan war veteran seized the national spotlight, his aides have been working to add to their team in the early-voting states.

The youth movement in MLS at the start of the 2019 season has seem a lot of success stories emerge. One of them is Philadelphia Union attacking midfielder Brenden Aaronson who become important to his team and also could make a late push to be part of the United States U-20 World Cup team.

of the 2019 MLS season has seen an impressive amount of playing time given to young domestic players. In total, 53 players eligible for either the U.S. U-17, U-20, and U-23 teams have played at least one game. For many fans it has been refreshing to see as many of these young players have now become key players for their teams.Brenden Aaronson, 18, fits that mold and has been among the better players so far for the Philadelphia Union. The Medford, N.J. native was initially given minutes when Mexican international Marco Fabian was serving a suspension. But Aaronson thrived in Fabian’s absence and it forced head coach Jim Curtin to find a way to keep both Aaronson and Fabian on the field at the same time. The result has been a diamond midfield with Aaronson shifting from his natural No. 10 position into one of the dual No. 8 roles where he also has the freedom to push forward.As of now, both Philadelphia and Aaronson are happy with the early stages of his career. But it wasn’t long ago when Aaronson had to make the decision as to where to start his career. Aaronson had options abroad but both he and his family felt the Union offered him a platform to earn important first-team minutes early.Aaronson grew up an avid fan of Liverpool and readily acknowledges that he would like to play abroad in the future. He also grew up a Union fan and his family had season tickets during the inaugural season in 2010.Recently, the number of top young American players which have moved abroad has been split between those who have moved abroad right away and those who have started their careers in MLS before earning a transfer and Aaronson points to the examples of Tyler Adams and Canadian forward Alphonso Davies.“Last year you saw Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty playing for Philadelphia,” Aaronson told ASN. “They were playing young players and that was a turning point for me. I was definitely looking to go overseas but I felt this was the best option for me. I am a guy that likes to be on the ball a lot. I like a team that keeps possession more but some games you have to go off the counterattack - like the Atlanta game. It's good. Philly was just the best option and I've seen all these young guys come through and get their chance.”“I see it two ways,” he continued. “It's an awesome feed to Europe and you see guys like Adams, Davies, and Almiron getting sold and doing really well there. It's something to think about. MLS has made some big steps and I am happy to be a part of it.”Aaronson joined the Union organization from Real Jersey Football Club which has around 140 kids but has already sent nearly 20 players to the Union’s academy. The club was actually founded by Brendan’s father, Russell Aaronson, who still serves as the club’s president.The elder Aaronson recalls the decisions that went to into signing with the Union and says that it was decision for the entire family. He also emphasized that every kid is different in what is best at this stage of his career and that his younger son, Paxten Aaronson, who is also a top prospect might make a different decision.“You have to take each kid and think about the kid first,” Russell Aaronson said. “It sounds like a really easy idea to ship your kid over to Europe at 16 or 18 and say this is where you’re going to sink or swim. But you have to remember you’re dealing with teenage kids first…They need mentoring, parenting and school.”“I think for Brenden, we had a comfort level with the Union - especially Jim Curtin and the staff,” Russell Aaronson added. “He had some opportunities and some really good ones, but in the end of the day, you have to know your child. For some kids they have to get away from their comfort zone, and for some Europe is that - to get away from their parents... With Brenden, he pushes himself and we didn't have to send him to Europe to provide that. He comes home, he's with his brother and sister and there is a bond there that if we broke that too early…. For us, the Union a very good launching pad. Every kid is different but for Brenden, this has been a very good situation where if he continues to succeed, we can look back and say it was the right path.”For a small-framed Aaronson, that path he chose in Philadelphia has been very promising at the start as he has adjusted to the men’s game well as Philadelphia is now in fifth place in the Eastern Conference to start the season. The best moment for Aaronson came in a 1-1 road draw against defending Champions Atlanta when Aaronson scored a big goal against Brad Guzan.“It's a lot more physical going from academy soccer to men's soccer,” Aaronson said. “I also played a lot in the USL last year so that was also something that allowed me to take this step into MLS. But the size is also part of it because I am still smaller. I still don't have that power yet so I have to think through the game. Just being able to read the game and know what is happening helps me.”For Russell Aaronson, watching his son develop at his club in New Jersey, he remembers that part of Brenden’s development was in large part due him being undersized during his youth. That forced him to think in detail about the game in order to succeed. Now that he is growing into his frame, he has the added physical skillset – but his foundation of reading and anticipating the game will always be his core.“Brenden has been under the radar, and I wouldn't have it any other way,” Russell Aaronson said. “I have pictures of him being undersized. There were giants around him throwing him around and he would get frustrated. To this day, he plays the game different because in his brain, he had to play differently. I give so much credit to something that frustrated him so much in his early years. It developed his brain. He grows, and he's still the same player and now he can start to use his physical abilities - and that hasn't even really started that yet. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon.”Curtin has been impressed with Aaronson and further believes his foundation centered on reading and thinking through games gives him a huge upside.“He’s been a guy that as a coach you can’t take off the field,” Curtin said . “He’s dominated games in Atlanta, against Columbus and some moments against Dallas. He just has left a really big impact and kind of is proof that too much in this country we get caught up in size and physicality when really it’s soccer IQ and knowing what to do and when to do it on the field and by the way he also runs and covers more ground than anybody so you can do both.”The past two months have also set up an interesting situation for Aaronson who trying to make a push to make the United States U-20 national team for the upcoming World Cup. ASN has heard Aaronson is on the preliminary 50-player roster for the World Cup team but some established players like Alex Mendez, Paxton Pomykal, Richard Ledezma, and Christian Cappis are his main competition. Aaronson has never played with the U-20 team but has played against it in a friendly while playing for the U.S. U-19 team.“I've never been with the U-20s but it's kind of been a breakout out beginning of the season,” Aaronson said. “I know the players that are in the pool right now. Alex Mendez is unbelievable. It's definitely going to be a hard pool to break into but it would be an absolute honor to represent the country at the U-20 World Cup. It's always an honor to represent your country.”

A Texas woman was arrested after her newborn child was found buried in a flowerpot in a cemetery, officials said.

Jazmin Lopez, 18, identified herself as the mother of the baby, who was found by a caretaker at Perry Cemetery on March 11, Fox station KDFW reported.

FLASHBACK: TEXAS WOMAN, 18, SAYS SHE'S THE MOTHER OF BABY WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND IN CEMETERY FLOWERPOT

The caretaker "emptied what he knew to be an out of place flowerpot and discovered the body of a deceased infant beneath the pot's soil," the Carrollton Police Department previously revealed in a news release.

Authorities said the baby "was a girl, 34 weeks to full term, and weighed just under six pounds."

Lopez allegedly first told investigators that she gave birth to the baby, who was not breathing or moving, while at home alone, the news station reported, citing an arrest warrant affidavit.

Police said that after they found a photo of a seemingly alive baby on her phone, the woman allegedly changed her story, claiming she gave birth in the bathroom with family members home.

“Jazmin demonstrated that she took her shirt off and wrapped the baby up. Jazmin said the baby was moving and gasping for air," the affidavit reportedly stated. "Jazmin said she knew the baby was about to cry so she covered her mouth."

Lopez told authorities she "took the shirt and covered the baby’s face and then held the baby against her body for one to two minutes," before allegedly putting the body in a basket of blankets.

When her friend arrived, she said she put the baby in a backpack and went to buy a flower pot. Lopez allegedly claimed she put the body in the flower pot, then placed dirt and flowers on top.

Investigators reportedly don't believe Lopez's claim that she covered the baby to keep her quiet, considering she had allegedly conducted a search history about abortion.

Lopez was taken into custody on Tuesday and charged with capital murder. As of Wednesday, she was reportedly being held at the Dallas County Jail on a $500,000 bond.
On March 31, Turkey went through yet another historic election. On the surface, the election itself is not that important: Unlike the parliamentary and presidential elections of the last year, Turkey’s local elections do not play any meaningful role in the distribution of executive or legislative power. Such elections merely decide who will run the basic public services at the municipal level. The results of the March 31 elections, despite all the fanfare it’s getting in domestic and foreign media, also did not produce a game-changing outcome. The Justice and Democracy Party (AKP) lost some of the largest urban areas, but, along with its ultranationalist ally, the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), was able to secure more than 51 percent of the votes nationwide. This nation-level outcome is in fact in alignment with how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan portrayed the local elections during his campaign: a nationwide referendum on himself as well as the so-called Cumhur Ittifaki (People’s Coalition). In the end, Erdogan achieved what he sought at the national level, and the People’s Coalition, despite the looming economic troubles, performed as well as it did in last year’s much more important elections. The next big elections are scheduled for 2023, and Erdogan has cleared the final electoral turning point that could delegitimize his rule until then.

So, what makes Turkey’s local elections historic? It is neither the elections themselves, nor the results. What makes the March 31 elections historic is how the AKP has been reacting to the election results and the potential implications of this reaction for the future of Turkish democracy. In an ironic turn, the AKP – a party that has long been accused of rigging elections by the opposition parties as well as a number of foreign spectators – immediately claimed that the elections might have been rigged (either by the opposition or some unknown dark forces), if only in districts where the AKP lost. In the eye of the storm lies the city of Istanbul, Turkey’s economic powerhouse, that the AKP (or its predecessors) has ruled since 1994.

Istanbul’s importance cannot be overstated: It is not only the largest city in Turkey, but also in Europe, and is home to almost 20 percent of the Turkish population. Istanbul’s economy is huge: The city’s GDP constitutes more than 30 percent of the Turkish economy, and is bigger than some of Turkey’s neighboring countries (for example, almost as big as Greece’s national GDP, and four times the size of Bulgaria’s). The city also creates enormous opportunities to feed the “party machine.” The gigantic budget of the mayor’s office allows the AKP to allocate resources, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to organizations and foundations that openly favor Erdogan. Furthermore, Istanbul is not only where Erdogan was born and raised, but it is also the “political birthplace” of the Turkish president: Erdogan shot to fame as the young and ambitious mayor of Istanbul, a title he held between 1994 and 1998.

In Istanbul, the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) put forward a relatively unknown candidate: Ekrem Imamoglu. Fronting a soft-spoken and conciliatory persona (which is an extremely rare commodity in the Turkish political universe), Imamoglu was seen by many as the quintessence of a “dark horse.” In a rare twist that most failed to foresee, Imamoglu ended up with more votes in Istanbul than the AKP candidate did. But the race for Istanbul was a very close call: The initial count for the difference was in the twenty thousands, in a city of more than ten million voters, with current estimates bringing the gap down to fifteen thousand votes or so. Of course, it is the AKP’s constitutional right to contest the election results, but how the AKP is contesting the elections suggests that the ruling party might be in a state of panic over Istanbul. Overall, the AKP’s reaction was swift, if poorly coordinated and clumsy, spearheaded with a multifaceted effort to dispute the results that spanned from “rumor bombardment” from pro-AKP media to paranoia-inducing statements from the AKP officials.

The AKP’s active measures to challenge the election results in Istanbul suggest that the ruling party is reluctant to let go of the city. Most notably, Turkey’s state news agency, Anadolu Agency, stopped updating the election results during the night of the elections, presumably right after it became apparent that the CHP votes would likely surpass those of the AKP in Istanbul. Furthermore, once the initial election results were declared by the Supreme Election Committee, Erdogan went on record and said that the CHP winning with only “thirteen to fourteen thousand votes” would not sit well with the people’s will. This statement not only flies in the face of the electoral logic itself, but also directly contradicts the statements coming from his party. During the night of the elections, well before the preliminary results were made public, AKP officials declared victory by claiming that Binali Yildirim, the AKP’s candidate in Istanbul, won by a margin of 3,870 votes. In addition, either due to the complexity of the voting mechanisms or pressure from the AKP, the Supreme Election Committee has been exceptionally slow in reaching a verdict over Istanbul. The patterns of electoral disputes also point toward an interesting dynamic. According to initial estimates, the AKP contested 67 of the 118 districts under scrutiny, with the Supreme Election Committee agreeing to investigate 58 of these cases (87 percent). By comparison, the opposition parties contested a total of 40 districts, with the Supreme Election Committee investigating only 5 so far (12.5 percent). Simply put, either the AKP makes a much stronger case for districts where it seeks investigation, or election officials are responding to the ruling party’s requests more favorably than it does those of the opposition parties.

In addition, the AKP has also pursued some unconventional methods to challenge the election results in Istanbul. One of the contested districts, Buyukcekmece, is an interesting example. The AKP claims that the contested district was home to organized voter fraud, during which numerous voters who did not actually live in Buyukcekmece were registered as residents and voted illegally on behalf of the opposition. Again, the AKP has not produced conclusive evidence showing that a voter fraud scheme existed and aimed to undermine the ruling party. However, initial reports suggest that more than a thousand police officers were mobilized to inquiry voters in the district, knocking on doors to figure out if the people who voted in Buyukcekmece were in fact living in the area. Another significant example comes from the standing mayor of Istanbul, Mevlut Uysal. Invoking the possibility of a fraudulent voter registration scheme, Uysal claimed that the AKP somehow identified that 3,092 of the ruling party’s voters were intentionally de-registered. What is striking is the method through which the AKP reached this conclusion: Uysal claims that the 3,092 de-registered voters had “last names” that easily showed that they are AKP supporters, a claim that flies not only in the face of logic, but also the ways in which Turkish last names can reveal clues into one’s partisan affiliation (they just don’t).

Overall, the AKP’s new turn to dispute elections in districts where they seem to have lost points toward the rise of a new dynamic in Turkish politics: “Ending up with more votes” no longer necessarily means “winning the elections.” Conversely, the AKP is making clear that the ruling party can be defeated at the ballot box only if they agree to the defeat.

As things stand, the fate of Istanbul is unclear, and what happens next is anyone’s guess. The AKP may eventually concede, or it may get what it appears to be seeking: either a partial or city-wide recount of the votes in Istanbul, or perhaps even repeat elections, hoping that these measures will bring Istanbul back to the fold. The AKP and pro-AKP media have so far failed to produce concrete evidence to support their allegations, but they most certainly seem to be pushing for the latter option. That being said, considering the potential secondary and tertiary side effects of such an outcome – which would include a backlash from foreign investors – not only for Turkey but also the AKP, there are also good reasons to think that Erdogan and his party will not torpedo the one theme that they have been relying on to legitimize their rule in the last seventeen years: the primacy and “sanctity” of the ballot box. Regardless, the members of the opposition, after having scored major local successes not only in Istanbul but also in Ankara, are faced with a puzzle: Is the AKP trying to steal the elections in Istanbul, or just merely stall the outcome to gain time before conceding?

In the midst of uncertainty as well as the informational fog and friction that skyrocketed right after the elections, answering the “steal or stall” question is not an easy feat. The fate of Istanbul, again, is unclear. Still, one thing is certain: how the battle for Istanbul plays itself out will set the tone for Turkish politics for many years to come. If the AKP concedes, two important consequences will follow. First, the opposition will be partially relieved and gain much needed self-confidence and morale to keep challenging the AKP in the future elections. Second, the loss of Istanbul will deal a considerable – but not decisive – blow to the AKP in terms of not only morale, but also much-needed finances that the “party machine” needs to keep its base satisfied. Under such circumstances, the AKP will likely push to undermine the CHP rule in Istanbul, either through limiting the administrative and financial autonomy of the mayoral office with new legislation, or by portraying the CHP’s Imamoglu as an incompetent and “shady” leader with dubious intentions.

“Stalling,” in this context, would come with two benefits for the AKP. First, assuming the party leadership, just like many spectators, did not expect such an outcome in Istanbul, it would give the AKP time to handle the transition in a way that would favor the governing party in the long run, or would at least limit the scope of accusations over exploitation of the city’s finances for partisan gains, an angle already invoked by Imamoglu. The second benefit of the “conceding after contesting hard” strategy, in turn, would involve a potential message the AKP may send to its base: We did not really lose Istanbul, but were overwhelmed by the trickery of the opposition. Such a narrative would make it possible for Erdogan to simultaneously minimize the loss of morale within his base that may follow from “losing Istanbul,” and keep delegitimizing the CHP rule and beyond. There would also be a side effect to this narrative: Intra-communal paranoia and enmity between AKP’s sympathizers and the opposition will further intensify. Such intensification helps Erdogan to solidify his base in the short run, but also comes with the risk of sparking domestic strife or instability in the long run.

In turn, if the AKP ends up with what it seems to want, that is, either a recount or repeat elections, all bets are off. The opposition will most certainly lose whatever belief it has left in the electoral system. Under such circumstances, at least for the opposition voters, elections will lose their meaning, since the idea that “we cannot win, even when we end up with more votes” will be ossified. This dynamic will then trigger what can be called “political nihilism,” with two potential consequences. For many members of the opposition, the first form of political nihilism would take the shape of disengagement from the electoral process, and accepting ultimate defeat. The opposition voters, and even political parties, may simply stop participating in elections as rigorously as they had done in the past. This outcome would be the final straw that would break the Turkish democracy’s back, and the AKP’s slide into outright authoritarianism will accelerate.

The second form of political nihilism, in turn, would have far more inflammatory consequences: some members of the opposition may turn to large scale protests in the streets, and in the extreme – and admittedly unlikely – case, the opposition parties may also decide to vacate their seats in the Parliament. The result would be a nationwide legitimacy crisis, and the AKP almost certainly would respond to such protests very harshly, criminalizing them as attempts at treason or a coup, and protestors as either traitors to the nation or willing, or unwilling, pawns of dark forces that aim to undermine Turkey’s sovereignty. To make matters even more unstable, not only the police but also the AKP’s sympathizers may also take to the streets to confront the protestors. In this doomsday scenario, Turkey would be faced with a combination of one, or more, of three outcomes: i) an outright dictatorship that would make George Orwell’s “1984” look like a children’s book; ii) internal strife and instability; iii) a military coup. The doomsday scenario, hopefully, is not the most likely one, but it is also one that needs to be taken into consideration.

In sum, neither the elections of March 31, nor the results are game-changers in Turkish politics all by themselves. Instead, the elections have become historic due to the AKP’s haphazard reaction to the results in Istanbul. The electoral “battle for Istanbul” still rages on, and how it will be resolved will largely influence the evolution, or deterioration, of Turkish democracy. Under such circumstances, any meaningful analysis of the election results – regarding “winners” and “losers” both at the local and national level – will have to wait for the outcome of the battle for Istanbul. Turkey’s largest city, also my hometown, has always been an important city, but its importance for the fate of Turkish democracy has never been this salient. Regardless of how the debacle over the local elections plays itself out, what happens in Istanbul will not stay in Istanbul, and will leave an important legacy for Turkish politics.

Attorney General William Barr will discuss special counsel Robert Mueller's report at a 9:30 a.m. ET press conference on Thursday.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will accompany him, according to NBC News. There was no indication that the report would be released before the press conference.

Mueller submitted the report to the Justice Department late last month. Barr will be releasing a redacted version of the approximately 400-page document, which details Mueller's findings about the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The redacted Mueller report on Russian election meddling is expected to be released to the public after Barr's press conference Thursday. Congress is slated to get copies of the report between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. ET, and it is expected to eventually be posted on the special counsel's Justice Department website.

The special counsel did not establish conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, Barr wrote in a four page summary released two days after he got the report.

On the question of obstruction, Barr quoted Mueller saying the report "does not conclude that the President committed a crime, [but] it also does not exonerate him."

The final decision on obstruction was left to Barr and Rosenstein They concluded: "The evidence developed during the special counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense."

Barr had been critical of the probe before Trump nominated him as attorney general. In a memo Barr sent to Justice Department officials in June last year, he explained that he thought the obstruction part of the investigation was "fatally misconceived."

While Trump has celebrated Barr's summary of Mueller's findings, he has also continued to complain that the investigation was a "witch hunt."

The secretive special council probe, which lasted nearly two years, included 19 lawyers and 40 investigators who interviewed hundreds of witnesses, executed nearly 500 search warrants and issued 2,800 subpoenas.

All told, criminal charges were lodged against 35 people and entities, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the president's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former national security advisor Michael Flynn.

Barr was confirmed as Trump's attorney general in February. Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general at the time Meuller was appointed special council, was routinely criticized and attacked by Trump for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation due to his contacts with Russian officials.

In the Overwatch League, incredible players must have outstanding dedication and drive. Those without that inner motivation either stagnate—seeing both the meta and opportunity pass them by—or worse, burn out, finding themselves retiring prematurely. How players maintain that drive, however, varies drastically from player to player. Some push themselves to be top of the leaderboards, others judge their worth purely from League standings. Dusttin "Dogman" Bowerman of the Atlanta Reign has a different strategy, looking to the inside.

“All I’m trying to do is focus on improving myself and keeping myself accountable,” said Dogman during an interview this weekend. “So that’s like my biggest thing: living in the moment, trying to get better now instead of thinking about where I am in the future.”

This sort of analytical and objective observation can be very helpful when looking for areas to improve. Feel like you need to work on your aim? Check out your accuracy or critical hit percentage. Need to improve your survivability? Track how many deaths you get, and analyze your positioning. Going up against another player in the same role as you? Compare stats and try to benchmark based on their performance.

The true challenge comes from where you set that bar, though. Too low, and you aren’t really improving. Too high, and you’re aiming for an impossible level of perfection. Dogman has set the bar relatively high for himself, aiming to play to the top of his ability in the Overwatch League.

“Right now I’m feeding my brains out,” he said, using a term that has come to be associated quite closely with the player (even his Twitch emotes feature the phrase). Feeding—for those not in the loop—is when a player on the opposing team dies repeatedly, allowing the enemy team to become more powerful. In Overwatch if a player dies, the players on the opposing team who contributed to that death gain ultimate charge, allowing them to reach their most powerful moves more quickly.

Reposted but WELCOME to the FEEDER club everyone! by @heyfelicia pic.twitter.com/dwzishfzCv — Dusttin Bowerman (@DogmanOW) April 16, 2019

Dogman’s take on the trash-talking has been part fun and part motivation. In doing it he not only is aiming to hold himself to a higher standard, but the rest of the league as well. If this sounds familiar—I’m looking at you, fans of LoL—it should. “I realized that one of my biggest inspirations now is Doublelift from League of Legends,” continued Dogman. “He holds himself accountable. The reason he thinks people are bad is because he thinks that he can improve, himself.”

“There’s a bunch of terrible players in the Overwatch League,” continued Dogman. “I think a lot of them are pretty bad, and feed a lot. So if I can get better—if I hold myself to that standard and hold everybody else to that standard—I can get there eventually.”

While it may be a rather assertive position, the idea that everyone has room to improve is not too controversial. There are always moments where one charges in as Reinhardt when they shouldn’t, or get baited into using Transcendence before it was necessary. Ideally, by calling out others—whether by labeling them feeders or otherwise—the skill floor is raised. However, there is the threat that you could be seen as a toxic or abrasive player, a line Bowerman works hard never to cross.

“You can be a vocal player that nobody really wants to have on their team,” said Dogman. “So you need to have that mix of when to be vocal and when to reel it back in.”

Dogman isn't the only one pushing on the boundaries when it comes to Overwatch League. It would seem the Vancouver Titans not only accept heel status, but are happy to take on the role.

A woman in a remote village carried out the first successful DIY caesarean section. "This is the one," says Ines Ramirez. From the corner of her one-roomed house, she picks up a wooden-handled knife with a six-inch blade. "I use it to cut fruit and vegetables now."

It is also the knife which Ines plunged into her womb and drew up her abdomen to carry out the world's only known successful, self-performed caesarean section. Today, she lies on the rough floor and demonstrates exactly how she gripped the knife on that night in remote, rural Mexico when she went into premature labour, five hours' travel from the nearest doctor.

Terrified lest the baby be still-born, as her previous one had been, Ines was determined to bring him into the world as quickly as possible. Fortified by two cups of almost 100 per cent proof alcohol, she grasped the knife by the blade rather than the handle, and used her index finger and thumb to apply pressure, as one would with a craft knife.

"I put the knife in here, then pulled it up," Ines says, pointing to her lower abdomen. "Once wasn't enough. I did it again. I was crying and screaming, in terrible pain." Lifting her skirt, she reveals a scar about seven inches long. "Then I cut open my womb and pulled the baby out by his feet. He cried straight away," For the first time in her company, Ines smiles.

A mother-of-eight, she lives in a hamlet in the Oaxaca region of Mexico. News of her remarkable do-it-yourself caesarean spread around the world only after the doctor who would eventually tend for the mother and her baby son, Orlando, was sent on attachment to a hospital in Chicago. An American colleague later wrote it up in the International Journal for Gynaecology and Obstetrics.

Ines emerges from her house, one of three small dwellings built of roughly made bricks that stand in a clearing of tierra colorada, the red earth common in the region, surrounded by a pine forest. A slim but sturdy woman about five feet tall, she is wearing a bright red dress and a green apron. Three young children are in attendance. Ines, 43, had her first child when she was 15.

Her house has bare walls and no furniture, though there is a black-and-white television in one corner. Electricity has recently arrived in her village of Rio Talea, but water has to be brought from a well. A fat pig forages among piles of chopped wood around the outdoor stove. Inside, Ramirez pounds maize on a slab of volcanic rock to make the tortillas that form the basis of the family's diet, enlivened by salsas of tomato, chilli and onion. In this remote district, meat is a rarity.

Today, as on the night Ines gave birth, there is no sign of a man around the house. "En el campo [in the countryside]," she shrugs. Gently pressed to elaborate, she replies again: "En el campo," suggesting that the children's father is an itinerant labourer, or perhaps a wood cutter who illegally fells trees at night.

Haltingly at first, Ines tells the remarkable story of how she gave birth. "I had seven children before Orlando," she says. "There was no problem with the births. But the eighth baby died. My waters broke and the midwife said I needed a caesarean but I couldn't get to the hospital in time. I felt the baby struggling but then it stopped moving.

"When I was seven months pregnant with Orlando, one night the pain began. It was terrible. I couldn't bear it. I started to panic. I knew I had to do something or this baby would die too. I knew I had to get it out somehow."

Her son Benito, who was then eight years old, was sent up the hill to a little shop half a mile away to buy a kitchen knife. "We had a knife but it wasn't that sharp." In her desperation not to lose another child, Ines cut into her womb as if cutting a tortilla. "Blood came out of me like a fountain." Pushing aside her internal organs, she rummaged around inside and pulled out her son. To her great joy, the baby cried, and appeared healthy, but Ines's ordeal was only just beginning. As mother and baby lay on the floor, Ines cut the umbilical cord before putting her organs back in place as best as she could. "It was all a mess," she remembers.

Her son, Benito, was sent off once again - this time to find a man with first-aid training. He arrived with a sewing needle and thread and attempted to stitch the wound. "Then he piled me into a pasajero [a rural mini-bus] and drove me to the clinic." The clinic was an hour's drive away along bumpy winding roads, in the village of San Lorenzo Texmelucan. "A lady doctor saw me," Ines continued. "She took one look and said, 'You've got to go to San Pedro'. They put me and the baby in the back of a pick-up truck."

The state hospital at San Pedro was another two-hour drive away down unpaved roads, on the main highway that links Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido, a holiday resort on the Mexican coast. By this stage, her pain numbed only by the alcohol, Ines was near to collapse. "The lady doctor had phoned San Pedro and they'd sent an ambulance," she says. "I can hardly remember the rest."

Four years later - Orlando is now a healthy little boy who attends nursery school every day - Dr Onorio Galvan, head of the obstetrics department in the state hospital in San Pedro, remains astonished. "She was my star patient," he says. Switching on his computer, he plays a little clip of a small woman in a white hospital smock, carrying a baby in her arms. It is his reminder of the week - remarkably, she stayed no longer - that Ines spent in his hospital.

"I couldn't believe it," says Dr Galvan. "There was no sepsis in the wound, no internal bleeding. She was back on her feet in a couple of days." Five days later, she was on her way back home - by bus. Today, her younger children are charging around the house. Orlando, a bright-eyed boy, breaks into a run to catch up with his brother and sister, aged 12 and 13 respectively. He falls over, gets up, dusts himself down and carries on.

As for his mother, she still remembers how she brought Orlando home from hospital on that long bus journey. The bus followed a circuitous route through the hills to Ines's village. It was a 12-hour journey, so Ines didn't stay on board to its final destination. Reaching the mountains where she lives, she got off. With Orlando strapped to her back in a shawl, she walked for one and a half hours along footpaths to reach her home. "It was a short-cut," she explains.

A man who starred as a gangland figure in T2 Trainspotting has been shot dead in Edinburgh's west end.

Bradley Welsh, 48, who also featured in an episode of Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men, was killed outside his home in Chester Street at 20:00 on Wednesday.

Police have confirmed that the death is being treated as murder.

One resident said he was told someone had been shot in the head and people were instructed to stay indoors as the street was cordoned off.

Armed officers were sent to the scene after receiving "multiple reports" of a firearm discharge.

Police later confirmed that a man had died at the scene after being found in a stairwell to a basement apartment with a serious injury.

Detectives said early investigations indicated that it was an isolated attack.

Welsh starred alongside Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle in T2 Trainspotting, playing the gangland figure Mr Doyle.

Author Irvine Welsh paid tribute to "his beautiful friend" on social media.

Writing on Twitter, the Trainspotting writer said: "Bradley John Welsh, my heart is broken. Goodbye my amazing and beautiful friend. Thanks for making me a better person and helping me to see the world in a kinder and wiser way."

In Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men on Bravo in 2008, Bradley Welsh described himself as a "born leader".

In the programme he discussed his past as a Hibs Casual football hooligan in the 1980s.

He talked about how he "mobbed and robbed" and was involved with organised "smash and grabs" at stores, including Jenners in Edinburgh.

He later became involved in organising security at hundreds of clubs in Edinburgh.

'I thought I was Don Corleone'

He told the programme: "I was 17 years old, just turning 18, and I thought I was Don Corleone.

"I thought this is it, I can do whatever I want. I was fearless. I was being perditious to people, overpowering people - it was a kick."

Welsh, who was a father, later spent four years in prison for extorting money from estate agents.

However, the boxer later became involved in charity projects in Edinburgh, including helping young people to stay away from a life of crime through his Holyrood Boxing Gym.

He was the British ABA lightweight boxing champion in 1993.

Local resident Alasdair Morton said armed police sealed off the area from Walker Street to Manor Place as someone had suffered a "gunshot wound to the head".

'Massive bang'

Mr Morton, 46, said: "I came out the house and we were told to go back in. Around three police cars and a black van drove along the street and the traffic then stopped.

"I initially thought it was a police escort then when I had a look there must have been a dozen or so police with guns pushing the traffic back.

"We've not been told anything but police waved through some ambulances.

"They said 'there's a gunshot wound to the head somewhere'. We could still hear noises that suggested there was a situation still going on."

A woman, who did not want to be named, was in her flat across the road from the incident when she heard a "massive bang".

She added: "I was in the kitchen and heard a bang. I ran through to my boyfriend and said 'what was that?', because it sounded a little bit weird.

"Then there were loads of SWAT teams - the police were here super-quick."

Extra patrols

On social media, one man described Welsh as a "huge character" in Edinburgh.

He said: "Devastating news about Brad Welsh tonight, a huge character in Scottish amateur boxing and the Hibernian support and someone who contributed a great deal to society through his charitable work and boxing gym. RIP."

Image copyright PA Image caption Forensic officers have been combing the scene for evidence

Det Supt Allan Burton, from Police Scotland's major investigation team, said: "At this time our deepest sympathies are with this man's family and a significant inquiry is now under way to trace everyone who was involved in the murder.

"I would ask that anyone who was within Chester Street, or the west end of Edinburgh on Wednesday evening, and who saw anyone, or anything suspicious, to contact the police immediately.

"Part of this investigation will focus on obtaining CCTV from nearby homes and businesses and we would also urge any motorists who were in the area and may have relevant dashcam footage to share this with us."

He added: "Murders remain extremely rare in the capital, and such incidents where a firearm is used are even more uncommon.

"However, we wish to reassure the public that considerable resources are being dedicated to this inquiry and we are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness."

Ch Insp David Robertson, local area commander for Edinburgh city centre, added: "We recognise and understand the profound impact this incident will have had, both on those connected to the victim and to the local community of the west end.

"There will naturally be a high officer presence in the area over the forthcoming days both to offer reassurance and gather any relevant information that may be of use to the inquiry."

Urimelige rasismeanklager fra Oslo SV

Oslo SV bidrar til en reglerett kampanje mot årets revy på Stovner videregående skole. Vi som skriver under reagerer på de kontinuerlige angrepene mot Stovnerrevyen.

15 april







Årets Stovnerrevy var et felles løft, etter ti års «tørketid» for de lokale kunstnerspirene. Under veiledning av Shabana Rehman Gaarder fra Født Fri, en organisasjon som i første rekke arbeider mot negativ sosial kontroll, og komikeren Zahid Ali , utarbeidet ungdommer ved skolen – nesten samtlige med minoritetsbakgrunn – et kreativt konsept, ofte med satirisk preg. Elevene tok utfordringen og skapte et variert program som sparker i alle retninger. Alle som så revyen fikk med seg hvor umåtelig stolte ungdommene var over forestillingen.

Men så startet spetakkelet. Noen få av de drøyt 700 ungdommene ved skolen reagerte på harselas med religion, og ikke minst en sketsj hvor en lyshudet person brukte noe mørk sminke i ansiktet. Sketsjen forklares grundig i forløpet til den omstridte scenen, slik at alle får med seg poenget om at dette er en hvit politikvinne som prøver å infiltrere et minoritetsmiljø på Stovner. Satiren har en antirasistisk undertone man ikke kan unngå å få med seg. Her er det hvite politifolks fordommer som latterliggjøres, ikke personer med mørk hud.

Likevel kom kjapt de første angrepene. Revyen ble beskyldt for å ta i bruk «blackface», og dermed fremme rasistiske fordommer. Begrepet stammer fra en gammel amerikansk teatertradisjon som latterliggjorde mørkhudete. Det har også forekommet i Norge, men har ingen tilsvarende tradisjon her. Bruken av mørk sminke i Stovnerrevyen har da heller intet med denne tradisjonen å gjøre, på lik linje med at Robert Stoltenbergs rolle som «Ali Silmandar» i Borettslaget eller Otto Jespersens «Nazi-Per» ikke handlet om å legitimere hat og fordommer.

Det er viktig å poengtere at revyen ble møtt med overveldende positive reaksjoner, både av elever på skolen, prominente politikere og medier som overvar den. Kronprinsesse Mette-Marit ga den sine varmeste anbefalinger og SVs oppvekstbyråd Inga Marte Thorkildsen uttalte følgende: «Alle politikere burde se «Stovnerske tilstander» - se og rødme – SVere også. Jeg lo meg skakk. Kort sagt: Fantastisk!»

Tre av elevene ved skolen skrev likevel et kritisk innlegg i Dagbladet, og de er i sin fulle rett til å reagere negativt på forestillingen. Man kan gjerne diskutere virkemidlene og kritikk skal lyttes til. Skolen har fulgt opp dette internt. Rektoren ved skolen fastslo på NRK at revyen må anses som en klart legitim kunstnerisk ytring, og her burde saken vært lagt død.

Bråket som fulgte er blåst ut av alle proporsjoner. Det er viktig å være klar over at nesten samtlige kritikere ikke har sett forestillingen. Vi reagerer fremfor alt på at lederen for SVs inkluderingsutvalg, Marian Hussein, beskriver revyen som rasistisk, uten å ha sett den. Likevel presterte hun å sammenligne de kritiske elevene med selveste Rosa Parks, og kobler dermed implisitt de som støtter revyen med rasesegreringen i USA på 50-tallet. Hun trakk også linjer til slavetiden. Vi mener at Hussein ser rasismespøkelser på høylys dag og tufter sin kritikk på misvisende fremstillinger.

Det er denne håpløst urimelige kritikken som Oslo SV nå har delt på sin FB-side, og som foranlediger dette oppropet. Det sender uheldige signaler når SVs representanter på sviktende grunnlag bidrar til å bakvaske unge revytalenter og Født Fri her. Ansvarlige politikere i partiet bør gripe inn og ta klar stilling til rasismebeskyldningene. Som Født Fri skriver: «De som betaler prisen for Husseins og andres stempling av revyen er skuffede stovnerungdommer som kjemper for Stovners stolthet med musikk, teater, standup og dans».

Varaordføreren i Oslo, Kamzy Gunaratnam, er også klar i sin tale: «Når minoritetselever raljerer med seg selv og sitt lokalmiljø i en skolerevy for så å bli utskjelt for å være rasister, må jeg bare spørre: Leter vi etter rasisme med lupe?»

Mye av kritikken som fremmes i kjølvannet av Husseins TV-opptreden går langt over streken for det akseptable. Det kan ikke Hussein klandres for, men Oslo SV velger altså under slike omstendigheter å kjøre saken videre. Det er også verdt å nevne at et annet medlem av SVs inkluderingsutvalg har fremmet påstander om at personer uten mørk hud ikke er meningsberettigede i denne saken. Er dette en form for inkludering SV som parti støtter?

De sterkt overdrevne reaksjonene på Telias reklamefilm nylig bekrefter en urovekkende tendens i retning av økende krenkelseshysteri. Vi er urolige over hva det gjør med debattklimaet i Norge. Rasismestempler som ikke underbygges av solide fakta er et grovt overtramp. Ufine rasismebeskyldninger er ikke sensur, men vil fremdeles kunne ha en kneblende effekt og virke polariserende. Mange vil nøle med å delta i samfunnsdebatten dersom dette blir gjennomgangstonen.

Vi vil derfor nå be alle aktører om å besinne seg. Ikke minst ønsker vi en oppklaring fra sentralt hold hos SV på om dette er partiets offisielle syn på Stovnerrevyen. Mener virkelig partiet at Stovner-elevene har presentert en rasistisk revy?

Publisert: 15.04.19 kl. 11:42
I’m not a huge fan of stories about stories, or those that explore the ins and outs of reporting a breach. But occasionally I feel obligated to publish such accounts when companies respond to a breach report in such a way that it’s crystal clear they wouldn’t know what to do with a data breach if it bit them in the nose, let alone festered unmolested in some dark corner of their operations.

And yet, here I am again writing the second story this week about a possibly serious security breach at an Indian company that provides IT support and outsourcing for a ridiculous number of major U.S. corporations (spoiler alert: the second half of this story actually contains quite a bit of news about the breach investigation).

On Monday, KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that multiple sources were reporting a cybersecurity breach at Wipro, the third-largest IT services provider in India and a major trusted vendor of IT outsourcing for U.S. companies. The story cited reports from multiple anonymous sources who said Wipro’s trusted networks and systems were being used to launch cyberattacks against the company’s customers.

Wipro asked me to give them several days to investigate the request and formulate a public comment. Three days after I reached out, the quote I ultimately got from them didn’t acknowledge any of the concerns raised by my sources. Nor did the statement even acknowledge a security incident.

Six hours after my story ran saying Wipro was in the throes of responding to a breach, the company was quoted in an Indian daily newspaper acknowledging a phishing incident. The company’s statement claimed its sophisticated systems detected the breach internally and identified the affected employees, and that it had hired an outside digital forensics firm to investigate further.

Less than 24 hours after my story ran, Wipro executives were asked on a quarterly investor conference call to respond to my reporting. Wipro Chief Operating Officer Bhanu Ballapuram told investors that many of the details in my story were in error, and implied that the breach was limited to a few employees who got phished. The matter was characterized as handled, and other journalists on the call moved on to different topics.

At this point, I added a question to the queue on the earnings conference call and was afforded the opportunity to ask Wipro’s executives what portion(s) of my story was inaccurate. A Wipro executive then proceeded to read bits of a written statement about their response to the incident, and the company’s chief operating officer agreed to have a one-on-one call with KrebsOnSecurity to address the stated grievances about my story. Security reporter Graham Cluley was kind enough to record that bit of the call and post it on Twitter.

In the follow-up call with Wipro, Ballapuram took issue with my characterization that the breach had lasted “months,” saying it had only been a matter of weeks since employees at the company had been successfully phished by the attackers. I then asked when the company believed the phishing attacks began, and Ballapuram said he could not confirm the approximate start date of the attacks beyond “weeks.”

Ballapuram also claimed that his corporation was hit by a “zero-day” attack. Actual zero-day vulnerabilities involve somewhat infrequent and quite dangerous weaknesses in software and/or hardware that not even the maker of the product in question understands before the vulnerability is discovered and exploited by attackers for private gain.

Because zero-day flaws usually refer to software that is widely in use, it’s generally considered good form if one experiences such an attack to share any available details with the rest of the world about how the attack appears to work — in much the same way you might hope a sick patient suffering from some unknown, highly infectious disease might nonetheless choose to help doctors diagnose how the infection could have been caught and spread.

Wipro has so far ignored specific questions about the supposed zero-day, other than to say “based on our interim investigation, we have shared the relevant information of the zero-day with our AV [antivirus] provider and they have released the necessary signatures for us.”

My guess is that what Wipro means by “zero-day” is a malicious email attachment that went undetected by all commercial antivirus tools before it infected Wipro employee systems with malware.

Ballapuram added that Wipro has gathered and disseminated to affected clients a set of “indicators of compromise,” telltale clues about tactics, tools and procedures used by the bad guys that might signify an attempted or successful intrusion.

Hours after that call with Ballapuram, I heard from a major U.S. company that is partnering with Wipro (at least for now). The source said his employer opted to sever all online access to Wipro employees within days of discovering that these Wipro accounts were being used to target his company’s operations.

The source said the indicators of compromise that Wipro shared with its customers came from a Wipro customer who was targeted by the attackers, but that Wipro was sending those indicators to customers as if they were something Wipro’s security team had put together on its own.

So let’s recap Wipro’s public response so far:

-Ignore reporter’s questions for days and then pick nits in his story during a public investor conference call.

-Question the stated timing of breach, but refuse to provide an alternative timeline.

-Downplay the severity of the incident and characterize it as handled, even when they’ve only just hired an outside forensics firm.

-Say the intruders deployed a “zero-day attack,” and then refuse to discuss details of said zero-day.

-Claim the IoCs you’re sharing with affected clients were discovered by you when they weren’t.

WHAT DID THE ATTACKERS DO?

The criminals responsible for breaching Wipro appear to be after anything they can turn into cash fairly quickly. A source I spoke with at a large retailer and Wipro customer said the crooks who broke into Wipro used their access to perpetrate gift card fraud at the retailer’s stores.

I suppose that’s something of a silver lining for Wipro at least, if not also its customers: An intruder that was more focused on extracting intellectual property or other more strategic assets from Wipro’s customers probably could have gone undetected for a much longer period.

A source close to the investigation who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media said the company hired by Wipro to investigate the breach dated the first phishing attacks back to March 11, when a single employee was phished.

The source said a subsequent phishing campaign between March 16 and 19 netted 22 additional Wipro employees, and that the vendor investigating the incident has so far discovered more than 100 Wipro endpoints that were seeded with ScreenConnect, a legitimate remote access tool sold by Connectwise.com. Investigators believe the intruders were using the ScreenConnect software on the hacked Wipro systems to connect remotely to Wipro client systems, which were then used to leverage further access into Wipro customer networks.

Additionally, investigators found at least one of the compromised endpoints was attacked with Mimikatz, an open source tool that can dump passwords stored in the temporary memory cache of a Microsoft Windows device.

The source also said the vendor is still discovering newly-hacked systems, suggesting that Wipro’s systems are still compromised, and that additional hacked endpoints may still be undiscovered within Wipro.

Wipro has not yet responded to follow-up requests for comment.

I’m sure there are smart, well-meaning and capable people who care about security and happen to work at Wipro, but I’m not convinced any of those individuals are employed in leadership roles at the company. Perhaps Wipro’s actions in the wake of this incident merely reflect the reality that India currently has no laws requiring data owners or processors to notify individuals in the event of a breach.

Overall, I’m willing to chalk this entire episode up to a complete lack of training in how to deal with the news media, but if I were a customer of Wipro I’d be more than a little concerned about the tone-deaf nature of the company’s response thus far.

As one follower on Twitter remarked, “openness and transparency speaks of integrity and a willingness to learn from mistakes. Doing the exact opposite smacks of something else entirely.”

In the interests of openness, here are some indicators of compromise that Wipro customers are distributing about this incident (I had to get these from one of Wipro’s partners as the company declined to share the IoCs directly with KrebsOnSecurity).

A new supercut video shows Fox News hosts slamming former President Barack Obama for the same actions that they either ignore or praise when it comes to President Donald Trump.

The footage, assembled by NowThis News, highlights personalities on the right-wing network attacking the former president for golfing, tweeting, executive actions, criticizing the press and being “almost obsessed with cable TV,” among other things. However, the footage was edited to remove Obama’s name ― and with that context excised, most of the commentary could just as easily refer to Trump:

What if Fox News covered Trump the way it covered Obama? It would look like this pic.twitter.com/dLfhHToieL — NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 16, 2019

The video features Fox News personalities who were on the air during the Obama years, and several are no longer with the network. Bill O’Reilly, for example, left in disgrace in 2017 amid New York Times reports that he spent a total of $45 million to settle multiple sexual harassment allegations.

Many of the hosts who’ve joined Fox News since then are very supportive of Trump. A few on the “news side” of the operation, including anchor Shep Smith, have been more critical of the president and the network’s hosts who uncritically support him.
Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold a press conference on Thursday at 9:30 am ET to discuss the release of a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Why it matters: Congress will receive the report around 11 am or 12 pm and release it to the public shortly after, according to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nearly 2 years after the special counsel was appointed, the public will get its most in-depth glimpse yet into what Mueller found in his investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Circulation and cellular activity were restored in a pig’s brain four hours after its death, a finding that challenges long-held assumptions about the timing and irreversible nature of the cessation of some brain functions after death, Yale scientists report April 17 in the journal Nature.

The brain of a postmortem pig obtained from a meatpacking plant was isolated and circulated with a specially designed chemical solution. Many basic cellular functions, once thought to cease seconds or minutes after oxygen and blood flow cease, were observed, the scientists report.

“The intact brain of a large mammal retains a previously underappreciated capacity for restoration of circulation and certain molecular and cellular activities multiple hours after circulatory arrest,” said senior author Nenad Sestan, professor of neuroscience, comparative medicine, genetics, and psychiatry.

However, researchers also stressed that the treated brain lacked any recognizable global electrical signals associated with normal brain function.

At no point did we observe the kind of organized electrical activity associated with perception, awareness, or consciousness. Zvonimir Vrselja

“At no point did we observe the kind of organized electrical activity associated with perception, awareness, or consciousness,” said co-first author Zvonimir Vrselja, associate research scientist in neuroscience. “Clinically defined, this is not a living brain, but it is a cellularly active brain.”

Cellular death within the brain is usually considered to be a swift and irreversible process. Cut off from oxygen and a blood supply, the brain’s electrical activity and signs of awareness disappear within seconds, while energy stores are depleted within minutes. Current understanding maintains that a cascade of injury and death molecules are then activated leading to widespread, irreversible degeneration.

However, researchers in Sestan’s lab, whose research focuses on brain development and evolution, observed that the small tissue samples they worked with routinely showed signs of cellular viability, even when the tissue was harvested multiple hours postmortem. Intrigued, they obtained the brains of pigs processed for food production to study how widespread this postmortem viability might be in the intact brain. Four hours after the pig’s death, they connected the vasculature of the brain to circulate a uniquely formulated solution they developed to preserve brain tissue, utilizing a system they call BrainEx. They found neural cell integrity was preserved, and certain neuronal, glial, and vascular cell functionality was restored.

The new system can help solve a vexing problem — the inability to apply certain techniques to study the structure and function of the intact large mammalian brain — which hinders rigorous investigations into topics like the roots of brain disorders, as well as neuronal connectivity in both healthy and abnormal conditions.

“Previously, we have only been able to study cells in the large mammalian brain under static or largely two-dimensional conditions utilizing small tissue samples outside of their native environment,” said co-first author Stefano G. Daniele, an M.D./Ph.D. candidate. “For the first time, we are able to investigate the large brain in three dimensions, which increases our ability to study complex cellular interactions and connectivity.”

While the advance has no immediate clinical application, the new research platform may one day be able to help doctors find ways to help salvage brain function in stroke patients, or test the efficacy of novel therapies targeting cellular recovery after injury, the authors say.

The research was primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) BRAIN Initiative.

“This line of research holds hope for advancing understanding and treatment of brain disorders and could lead to a whole new way of studying the postmortem human brain,” said Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, chief of functional neurogenomics at the NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health, which co-funded the research.

The researchers said that it is unclear whether this approach can be applied to a recently deceased human brain. The chemical solution used lacks many of the components natively found in human blood, such as the immune system and other blood cells, which makes the experimental system significantly different from normal living conditions. However, the researcher stressed any future study involving human tissue or possible revival of global electrical activity in postmortem animal tissue should be done under strict ethical oversight.

Everyone agreed in advance that experiments involving revived global activity couldn’t go forward without clear ethical standards... Stephen Latham

“Restoration of consciousness was never a goal of this research,” said co-author Stephen Latham, director of Yale’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics. “The researchers were prepared to intervene with the use of anesthetics and temperature-reduction to stop organized global electrical activity if it were to emerge. Everyone agreed in advance that experiments involving revived global activity couldn’t go forward without clear ethical standards and institutional oversight mechanisms.”

There is an ethical imperative to use tools developed by the Brain Initiative to unravel mysteries of brain injuries and disease, said Christine Grady, chief of the Department of Bioethics at the NIH Clinical Center.

“It’s also our duty to work with researchers to thoughtfully and proactively navigate any potential ethical issues they may encounter as they open new frontiers in brain science,” she said.
A Texas woman was arrested after her newborn child was found buried in a flowerpot in a cemetery, officials said.

Jazmin Lopez, 18, identified herself as the mother of the baby, who was found by a caretaker at Perry Cemetery on March 11, Fox station KDFW reported.

FLASHBACK: TEXAS WOMAN, 18, SAYS SHE'S THE MOTHER OF BABY WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND IN CEMETERY FLOWERPOT

The caretaker "emptied what he knew to be an out of place flowerpot and discovered the body of a deceased infant beneath the pot's soil," the Carrollton Police Department previously revealed in a news release.

Authorities said the baby "was a girl, 34 weeks to full term, and weighed just under six pounds."

Lopez allegedly first told investigators that she gave birth to the baby, who was not breathing or moving, while at home alone, the news station reported, citing an arrest warrant affidavit.

Police said that after they found a photo of a seemingly alive baby on her phone, the woman allegedly changed her story, claiming she gave birth in the bathroom with family members home.

“Jazmin demonstrated that she took her shirt off and wrapped the baby up. Jazmin said the baby was moving and gasping for air," the affidavit reportedly stated. "Jazmin said she knew the baby was about to cry so she covered her mouth."

Lopez told authorities she "took the shirt and covered the baby’s face and then held the baby against her body for one to two minutes," before allegedly putting the body in a basket of blankets.

When her friend arrived, she said she put the baby in a backpack and went to buy a flower pot. Lopez allegedly claimed she put the body in the flower pot, then placed dirt and flowers on top.

Investigators reportedly don't believe Lopez's claim that she covered the baby to keep her quiet, considering she had allegedly conducted a search history about abortion.

Lopez was taken into custody on Tuesday and charged with capital murder. As of Wednesday, she was reportedly being held at the Dallas County Jail on a $500,000 bond.

With the release of “Split,” M. Night Shyamalan saw his best reviews since the 1999 breakout “The Sixth Sense.” As the surprise sequel to 2000’s “Unbreakable,” the 2016 “Split” won over many critics who had become skeptical of his bumpy filmography. But when he completed his trilogy with the January 2109 release of “Glass,” Shyamalan found himself in a familiar place.

“I was in London when I heard the U.S. reviews for ‘Glass’ were poor,” Shyamalan told the NYU’s Stern School of Business, where he delivered the 2019 Ashok C. Sani Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence lecture April 16. “I was in a makeup chair for a TV show, and I cried.”

While “Glass” made nearly $250 million worldwide, it landed the director some of his worst reviews (Rotten Tomatoes: 37%). The filmmaker has always been sensitive to criticism, but he also shared his ability to contend with the backlash, and offered advice for uncertain film students in the room.

The lecture is named for the late real estate entrepreneur who graduated from NYU’s Stern School of Business; he also was the uncle of Shyamalan’s wife, Bhavana Vaswani. Over the course of his hourlong lecture, “The Struggle to Find Your Voice,” Shyamalan portrayed himself as a lifelong outsider, stretching back to his experiences as one of the few Indian-American students at a mostly white public school. He often veered into abstract observations about group dynamics and the challenges of maintaining individuality when faced with doubt. When it came to the recent reception for “Glass,” however, he turned to a specific anecdote.

“We’d just come back from the London screenings, which were through the roof,” he said. “We had only great screenings of the movie around the world. So essentially I wasn’t prepared. I had this false sense of being a part of the group in a safe way. But boy, did I feel distraught that day.”

Shyamalan’s career has been fraught with unreasonable expectations. After “The Sixth Sense” became a commercial phenomenon and an Oscar nominee, the filmmaker was on the cover of Newsweek with a headline proclaiming him the next Steven Spielberg. His attempt to make a sprawling fantasy epic with 2006’s “Lady in the Water” became an infamous catastrophe and the subject of a book detailing the dysfunctional shoot.

But Shyamalan has been nothing if not relentless in his pursuit to regain his stature as a major American filmmaker. The scrappy 2015 found-footage horror movie “The Visit” allowed him to deliver another commercial hit and solid reviews, opening the door for the massive success of “Split” one year later. Nevertheless, “Glass” brought him back to a familiar place — striving to reconcile his commercial success with a mixed reputation.

“Honestly, I was feeling like, ‘Will they never let me be different without throwing me on the garbage pile?’” Shyamalan said. “The feeling of worthlessness rushed me, and to be honest, it doesn’t ever really leave. But anyway, the film went on, right? It became number one in every country in the world, and it represents my beliefs.”

He hasn’t wasted any time moving on. Shyamalan is currently in production on the Apple series “Servant,” and is developing a mysterious new feature called “Labor of Love.” In his lecture, the filmmaker acknowledged his sensitivity required a reality check.

“I’ve had more success than anybody should be allowed to have,” he said. “I mean, everything I’ve ever written has been offered to be made into a movie, and my nine films that are original ideas have averaged $270 million each. I just think I can’t complain about anything. But I get tired.”

That feeling, he added, led him to accept directing gigs on “The Last Airbender” and “After Earth.” He regretted those choices. “I did a couple huge, big-budget CGI movies,” he said. “There has always been this inexorable pull to join the group, a constant seduction in the form of whatever you want to tally, in the form of money, or safety, ease, not getting criticized. I did these movies, and I rightfully got crushed, because they rightfully said, ‘You don’t believe in yourself, you don’t believe in your own voice, and in you don’t believe in your values.’ I felt really lost. It just didn’t work. There’s probably something Darwinian about all this.”

For “The Visit,” Shyamalan made the decision to begin investing in his own productions. “I pay for my movies now,” he said. “After this 10-year period of working at studios on junk movies, I was not happy.”

Regardless of Shyamalan’s current struggles with critics, he remains a singular voice in American cinema — and, as an NYU film school graduate, an inspiration to many students there. That was evident during the Q&A session following his lecture, when he dispensed advice to several film production students who cited him as among their favorite directors. The evening ended with a rousing moment, when one student who said he was from Mexico asked Shyamalan for professional advice.

“What do you want to be?” Shyamalan asked. “Writer? Director?”

“Director,” the student said. “But that’s really hard to accomplish.”

Shyamalan shot back with a heated response. “Dude, I don’t like the way you talk, bro,” he said. “How can you tell me that it’s going to be hard? Do you see a lot of people like you writing stories? Give me a break, bro. That’s your strength, that you’re not like us. Go out there and tell your stories. Don’t go out there and try to be like Quentin or me or anybody else. We need you. Tell me what makes you angry, why you’re arrogant, or fearful, whatever it is. Don’t hide anything. Be honest. What is that thing that bothers you and makes you distinct? Everyone’s looking for you. A Mexican point of view to tell a story right now? I’m telling you, everybody wants that right now.”

The audience erupted into applause. “I desperately need you to tell your story in your way,” Shyamalan said. “You are essential.”

The story of a woman who traveled from Florida to Colorado because of an alleged interest in Columbine High School and the mass murder perpetrated there 20 years ago disrupted school and life for children, parents and others throughout the Denver metro area in an unprecedented way on Wednesday.

But such stories are surprisingly common.

In December 2011, then-Columbine High School Principal Frank DeAngelis did an interview like he’d done many times before in the years since the 1999 attack on his school.

Columbine High School Building Attracts Unwanted Visitors

The student reporter was visiting from Utah, and his questions were good, DeAngelis said.

"It was all about recovery. And he said, ‘Boy, I see how you created this wonderful environment. How were you able to do that?’" DeAngelis said.

A few days passed.

"I get a call from the Utah Police saying, ‘Was this kid there?’ I said, ‘Yeah,’ And I said, ‘Why?’ And he said, ‘Well, he had a plot to blow up his school.’" DeAngelis remembered.

The student turned out to be obsessed with Columbine.

Many who get fixated on the shooting stay in dark corners of the internet, but sometimes they move into the real world.

“There are people that want to feel it, touch it, see it, experience it,” said John McDonald, executive director of security and emergency management for Jefferson County Schools. “And those are the people that we have to say no to. That there's a memorial and we'd love for you visit the memorial but not our school.”

McDonald is responsible for the safety of some 85,000 students at more than 150 schools. But he said it’s Columbine that poses the biggest challenge.

If strangers show up to the school these days, McDonald said his team can usually stop them before they get out of their car. The district asked for two more patrol officers just for Columbine this year, saying that there’s been a significant increase in people trying to get into the building.

“It's expensive and it certainly costs more than any other school in the district to maintain the level of security that we need to here, probably by a factor of five times, six times more,” McDonald said. “That's our world.”

He’s even wondered if the school should’ve been torn down. That’s what happened with Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. DeAngelis said he’s thought about that, too. Two decades ago, the community decided to keep most of Columbine intact, but DeAngelis said that at the time, there was no way to anticipate the symbol this school building would become.

“I mean, if we could look ahead, say in 20 years this is what's going to be happening, I think we probably would have said we probably needed to relocate,” DeAngelis said.

McDonald isn’t sure it would have helped.

“The fact of the matter is that Columbine resonates across the country whether the building is here or not, it still resonates,” he said.

And in those last 20 years, it’s also been where some victims’ families come to feel closer to those they’ve lost.

“This building, for me, is a sacred place,” said Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, who was the first person killed in the attack. He says he and his wife come to the school every year, to leave a rose on the spot she was killed.

“Even though it was a place of horror and tragedy, it's always been a sacred place. Knowing that the lives of precious people were taken. And so, our focus has always been on them and not the shooters.”

Coni Sanders’ father, Dave, was killed right outside the old library. She visits annually, too. The spot where her father died is marked by a columbine flower in the floor. Coni Sanders speaks to reporters inside Columbine High School, March 23, 2019. Kevin J. Beaty/Denverite

“And last year, I showed up, and there were a bunch of kids sitting on the flower and they were doing a community service project,” Sanders said. “And at first, I was like, ‘Get off my flower. That's mine.’ And then I realized, this is what it's all about. This is what he would have wanted.”

Sanders says her dad dedicated himself to making his community a better place. And it makes her happy knowing that kids come there to do the same thing.

The threat this week — apparently inspired by the anniversary coming up Saturday — shows the dual identity of Columbine now. It’s been defined by the violence of 20 years ago, but McDonald says it’s also still a school.

“I've seen a lot of tragedy in my career,” he said. “And what I know is that our kids deserve a place that's free from threat, intimidation, harassment, bullying. We get to create good climate culture and positive environments. If we do that, then I think we can change our own story.”

The shooting 20 years ago is the school’s history. But McDonald says it won’t be Columbine’s legacy.

London (CNN) What's low-tech, sustainable and possibly the most effective thing we can do to fight climate change? Planting trees. A trillion of them.

Tom Crowther is a climate change ecologist at Swiss university ETH Zurich. Four years ago he found there are about 3 trillion trees already on earth -- much higher than NASA's previous estimate of 400 billion. Now, his team of researchers has calculated there is enough room on the planet for an additional 1.2 trillion -- and that planting them would have huge benefits in terms of absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.

"The amount of carbon that we can restore if we plant 1.2 trillion trees, or at least allow those trees to grow, would be way higher than the next best climate change solution," Crowther told CNN.

Because his research is currently under review for publication in the journal Science, he says he can't share exact figures of how much extra CO2 could be stored by those trees. But he points to numbers from Project Drawdown -- a non-profit that ranks climate solutions by the amount of CO2 they could remove from the atmosphere. Its number one ranked solution -- managing the release of HFC greenhouse gases from fridges and air conditioners -- could reduce atmospheric CO2 by 90 billion tons. Crowther says planting 1.2 trillion trees would give a reduction "way above" that figure.

To put that in context, global CO2 emissions are around 37 billion tons per year.

Can it be done?

But while there may be space for a trillion new trees, is it actually practical to plant that number?

One organization that thinks so is youth-led Plant for the Planet (PFTP), which is running the "Trillion Tree" campaign to do just that.

Set up as the "Billion Tree" campaign by the UN in 2006, it was later handed over to PFTP, which has upped its planting ambitions in response to Crowther's work.

Felix Finkbeiner founded Plant for the Planet in 2007, when he was just nine years old. He is now a PhD student at Tom Crowther's lab at ETH Zurich. He's pictured at an award ceremony in 2015.

It has already planted nearly 15 billion trees, with the help of various governments, including India's, which has planted more than 2 billion trees as part of the initiative.

"I think a trillion trees is achievable," says PFTP chairman Sagar Aryal. "It's not that we don't have enough money in the world -- maybe governments alone can't do enough but if we work together with the private sector we can do it."

The right location

Crowther is a scientific adviser to Plant for the Planet, providing them with information on the best places to restore trees. He says all the locations identified by his team are on degraded land, rather than agricultural or urban areas.

"These are places where farms have been abandoned, or where there's been deforestation and it's been left," he explains.

To successfully fight climate change, it's vital that the right land is restored. For example, in parts of northern Europe, planting more trees could reduce the heat and light reflected from snowy ground, and actually increase global warming.

Joseph Veldman, of the department of ecosystem science and management at Texas A&M University, told CNN that although reforestation can play a role in carbon sequestration, "There is no doubt that super-aggressive tree planting efforts that are not done with consideration of the historic ecosystem will be a bad investment."

He says some previous reforestation projects have targeted grasslands and savannah ecosystems that already play an important role in storing carbon.

Such schemes often plant exotic trees, like pine and eucalyptus, which are very flammable and also valuable as timber and pulp, he says. As a result, the carbon they store above ground can be lost to wildfires or logging.

Crowther agrees wholeheartedly. "All the models that previously existed about where forest can be restored disregard whether they should," he said. "We don't just model the forest, we also model grasslands and shrublands and piece them all together to reveal what should be where."

Growing in popularity

Tree planting is no quick climate fix. It can take 30 to 40 years of growth for the carbon storage to reach its full potential. A more immediate benefit can come from halting deforestation, says Crowther, which costs our planet around 15 billion trees each year.

But although tree planting on such a colossal scale faces significant challenges (not least identifying who owns the land in question, and securing the rights to plant and maintain trees there), widespread efforts are already underway.

The Australian government has announced it will plant 1 billion trees by 2030; work is underway on a "Great Green Wall" to stop the spread of the Sahara by restoring 100 million hectares of degraded land (and sequester 250 million tons of carbon), and China's anti-desertification program, also known as the "Great Green Wall," has planted more than 50 billion trees since the 1970s. The UN-endorsed Bonn Challenge aims to reforest 350 million hectares of degraded land globally by 2030.

Africa's Great Green Wall aims to slow down desertification.

Crowther says he was once skeptical about the benefits of tree planting, but has now changed his mind.

"Climate change is seen as such an immense and complicated issue -- it feels like it's seen as someone else's problem, someone else is dealing with it or not dealing with it, and no one has a simple message for how to go about tackling it," he says.

"I'd like to try and champion this as a solution that everyone can get involved in. If all the millions of people who went on climate marches in recent weeks got involved in tree planting the impact would be huge."

A DOJ spokesperson said earlier this week that Mueller’s redacted report would be released Thursday morning.

President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump calls Sri Lankan prime minister following church bombings Ex-Trump lawyer: Mueller knew Trump had to call investigation a 'witch hunt' for 'political reasons' The biggest challenge from the Mueller Report depends on the vigilance of everyone MORE also said Wednesday that Barr would be holding a press conference and that he also might hold his own conference.

The release of Mueller's report is highly anticipated, as it's expected to include the special counsel's findings during the course of his 22 month investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Barr said in a letter to Congress last month that Mueller determined that there was no coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, but that the special counsel did not reach such a conclusion on obstruction of justice.

Rather, Barr said, Mueller laid out the evidence for both sides of an obstruction charge. The attorney general said he and Rosenstein determined that the evidence was not sufficient to bring forward such a charge against Trump.

That evidence is likely to be seized upon by Democrats in Congress, some of whom have argued that Barr should not have been the one to decide against charging the president with obstruction.

But the report is also expected to be heavily redacted, as Barr has said he will not include some information, such as grand jury materials, in the public version of the report.

The House Judiciary Committee, led by chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerDemocrats leave impeachment on the table House Judiciary chair to call on McGahn to testify before Congress Tim Ryan doesn't back impeachment proceedings against Trump MORE (D-N.Y.), voted along party lines earlier this month to authorize a subpoena to obtain the full report from the DOJ. And Democrats are threatening to use that subpoena if they feel that too much information has been left out of the report.

Meanwhile, Republicans — including Trump himself — have used Barr's summary letter on the Mueller report to claim that the president is exonerated of all wrongdoing.
Investigative journalist Sara Carter reported that House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings and House Finance Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters allegedly “executed a secret Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to “target” President Trump and subpoena all his financial and banking records.”

Carter obtained a copy of a letter from Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member of the Oversight Committee, sent to Cummings on Monday.

She reports that, “The letter also indicates that other MOUs have apparently been signed and agreed to with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca, who has promised to continue investigations into the president despite findings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.”

A congressional official with knowledge of the MOUs told Carter, “We’d describe (the MOUs) as an agreement to conspire and coordinate their efforts to attack and investigate POTUS. This is not how committee’s normally operate. Dems aren’t interested in legislating. Only attacking POTUS.”

In his letter to Cummings, Jordan condemned the secret MOUs and wrote that Democrats:

Did not consult with Republican Members of the Committee or allow Members to consider and debate the terms of your MOU before executing the MOU with Chairwoman Waters. You did not disclose the MOU’s existence to Members or the American people until after I raised the matter. If you intend to continue to use the Committee’s limited resources to attack President Trump for political gain, I hope that you will at least be transparent about your actions. Your ability to function as a fair and unbiased finder of fact is now at grave risk. The Members of the Committee—and, more importantly, the American citizens we represent—deserve to know exactly how you are leading this Committee. I look forward to your detailed answers to these questions.

How many MOUs with committee chairpersons have you signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress? Would you provide the Committee with a detailed list of the other MOUs you have signed, including their dates, signatories, and topics? Why did you not publicly disclose that you had signed MOUs with committee chairpersons? Will you publicly disclose all the MOUs you have signed as Chairman since the beginning of the 116th Congress? Why did you choose not to consult with any Republican Members before signing these MOUs? Have you signed any MOUs as Chairman with any entities outside of the House Representatives relating to the Committee’s oversight or legislative work? To the extent your MOUs create duties for the Committee that conflict with the Rules of the House of Representatives or the Rules of the Committee, which duties prevail? The Rules of the Committee for the 116th Congress do not authorize the Chairman to bind the Committee through an MOU.[2]Could you explain the specific authority that allows you to bind the Committee through an MOU without first obtaining approval through a vote of the Committee? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have committed to sharing Committee information with the Financial Services Committee. This provision of your MOU may conflict with Rules of the House of Representatives and the Committee’s whistleblower protocol, which requires the Committee to keep some Committee information confidential. Will you still protect the confidentiality of whistleblower information notwithstanding your apparent obligation to share it with the Financial Services Committee? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have agreed to consult with her before issuing a subpoena. Do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after you consult with me, as required by Committee Rules? If I object to your proposed subpoena, do you intend to consult with Chairwoman Waters before or after the Committee votes, as you promised in the Committee’s organizing meeting? As I understand your MOU with Chairwoman Waters, you have declined to include any provision protecting the Minority’s rights to documentary or testimonial information. Can you guarantee that Minority Members will have the same access to documentary or testimonial information under this MOU as we do in every other Committee inquiry?

None of us can possibly be shocked by this. Most of the Committee chairs have stated their plans to pursue Trump publicly and have already begun.

Although I’m unfamiliar with MOUs, it certainly doesn’t sound like business as usual in the United States House of Representatives. It sounds more like an agreement between mobsters.

What does surprise me is that lawmakers would put these agreements in writing. It’s almost as though they know they’re all snakes and they don’t trust each other. Imagine that.
The rates for car insurance in South Africa might be expensive, but it is essential that you are covered. Think about this for a moment, would you be able to cover the costs if something might happen to your vehicle? Even worse, would you be able to cover the expenses of another person’s property if you caused any damage to it with your car? These are things to consider before deciding that you will go without car insurance.

Getting the right policy

First of all, you should decide what kind of policy you will need. Not all plans are the same, and policies and their premiums will differ from one insurer to another. Most companies offer these three policies:

Comprehensive car insurance – This policy is the most comprehensive type of car insurance. It covers most accidents like road accidents, accidental damage due to hail or fire, theft, as well as damages you may have caused to a third party or their property. Third party, fire, and theft – This policy covers accidental damage to another person’s car or other property. Accidental damage to your vehicle will not be covered, only if it is due to fire. Theft and hijackings are also included. Third party cover only – As with the last mentioned policy, this policy will cover damage to a third party’s property. It will, however not cover damage due to fire or theft. This policy is usually the least expensive, but you have to keep in mind that your vehicle is not covered. This is ideal if your car isn’t very expensive, but you want to cover a third party, should you get into an accident.

Additional types of cover

There are several additional types of cover you can get for your vehicle. Not all companies offer these types of cover, and some of the insurers have them included in their primary policies. Here are a few of them:

Scratch and dent cover – This will cover the repair of all minor scratches and dents on your car.

– This will cover the repair of all minor scratches and dents on your car. Tyre and Mag coverage – This will cover your tyres and mags when it gets damaged by potholes.

– This will cover your tyres and mags when it gets damaged by potholes. Windscreen cover – This covers damage to your windows or windscreens.

– This covers damage to your windows or windscreens. Roadside assistance and towing – When your car breaks down on the road, you will have free roadside assistance and towing if you need it.

– When your car breaks down on the road, you will have free roadside assistance and towing if you need it. Extended warranty – This is not additional cover, but something I will mention here. You can get extended warranty or service plans for your vehicle to ensure you do not have to pay for the future services.

– This is not additional cover, but something I will mention here. You can get extended warranty or service plans for your vehicle to ensure you do not have to pay for the future services. Sound cover – If you have installed an audio system into your car, it will be covered if stolen.

– If you have installed an audio system into your car, it will be covered if stolen. Disability cover – If you got disabled in an accident, which affected your ability to work and provide an income, this policy would protect you financially.

– If you got disabled in an accident, which affected your ability to work and provide an income, this policy would protect you financially. Lost key cover – Should you lose your key or remote for your vehicle, this will cover the costs for replacement.

What will affect your premiums?

Several things will affect your monthly premiums, and different companies will determine your premiums differently. Here are some of the things they may take into consideration:

The type of cover you have

The kind of vehicle you drive

The cost of your car

The mileage your car has driven

The distance you drive on a monthly basis

The security you have in place

The age of your vehicle

The age and driving experience of the driver

The location you park your car during day and nighttime

Your excess amount

Your gender

Your driving history

Your credit score

Your profession

If you cover the regular driver of the vehicle or any person with a drivers license

The popularity of your car (this has a direct correlation to the risk of hijacking or theft)

What is insurance excess?

Excess is the additional amount you will have to pay when you claim from your insurance company. You usually get to choose your excess, and you will see that a higher excess will result in lower monthly premiums, but a lower excess will result in higher premiums. Because of this, people tend to choose a higher excess, but this is not always the best option.

Think about it this way; let’s say you have the option to choose from one of two excess amounts, an amount of R2000 or one of R5000. An excess of R2000 will mean that your monthly premiums will be higher, but when you claim from your insurance, you will have to pay them an additional amount of R2000 and not R5000. It is much easier to get R2000 in the event of an emergency than it is to get R5000, although the excess of R5000 will result in lower monthly insurance premiums.

Sometimes you even have to decide if it is worth it to claim from your insurer when you have a very high excess amount. Let’s say you choose an excess amount of R5000. Now you bump your car into an obstacle, and the damage costs R3000 to repair. In this scenario, it wouldn’t even be worth it to claim from your insurer. You can rather pay the R3000 the fix the damage yourself than pay the insurance company the R5000 excess.

How to get car insurance quotes

There are several ways to acquire quotes. You can go to each of the car insurance companies in South Africa and ask them for a quotation. Additionally, you can use a car insurance aggregator like Hippo or InsurAcar which will provide you with different quotes from different insurers.

How to choose the best company

When you have received quotations from different companies, do not necessarily select the company with the lowest rates. Be sure to check what is covered in their policies, as one plan may seem cheaper, but it is because it does not cover everything the next company’s plan does.

Be sure to read the reviews of companies on HelloPeter or similar websites. Remember, these sites exist for people to complain about companies, and many people do not leave reviews when they have a positive experience. This is because everyone believes that they should always receive exceptional service, and therefore they do not praise it when they get it.

Single reviews should not affect your final decision, but when there are many complaints about a company does not answer their phones, for example, it should raise a red flag.

Conclusion

As you can see, there are many factors you have to keep into consideration when choosing a policy and a company to insure with. Take it one step at a time, and you will soon see that some companies always stand out due to their premiums and exceptional customer service. Good luck in your search, we hope you have learned a few things from this article!

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — The University of St. Thomas closed businesses and canceled classes on its St. Paul campus Wednesday due to a bomb threat. An all-clear has since been issued, and regular operations will resume Thursday.

The initial threat was made just after 9:30 a.m. but did not mention a specific location.

A second threat was received about 40 minutes later, naming McNeely Hall. The University evacuated that building and surrounding ones on Summit Avenue.

“It’s scary, it’s definitely scary,” said Ella Rasmussen, a University of St. Thomas student.

Around 11 a.m., St. Thomas sent out an alert saying the threat had expired, but shortly afterward the school announced that classes were canceled for the day.

A University spokesperson said that after searching campus buildings, no suspicious objects were found.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - A China pode concordar em permitir mais importações brasileiras de carne após negociações de alto nível marcadas para maio, disse à Reuters na segunda-feira o embaixador chinês no Brasil.

Yang Wanming recusou-se a comentar sobre quantas plantas de processamento de carne poderiam ser aprovadas para exportar para a China, mas disse que a questão será discutida quando a ministra da Agricultura do Brasil, Tereza Cristina, viajar para a China em maio.

Novas permissões de exportação podem ser anunciadas quando o vice-presidente do Brasil, Hamilton Mourão, visitar Pequim no mesmo mês, disse Yang.

"Acreditamos que, através da cooperação dos ministérios da Agricultura dos dois países e seus departamentos de inspeção de qualidade, mais produtos agrícolas e animais brasileiros possam ser importados para o mercado chinês", disse Yang.

Até 78 unidades brasileiras de processamento de carne poderiam ser adicionadas à lista de autorizadas a exportar para a China, de acordo com uma pessoa a par do assunto.

O potencial aumento das exportações de carne do Brasil para a China vem em momento em que analistas alertam que as negociações entre os Estados Unidos e a China para aliviar as tensões comerciais podem prejudicar a demanda pela soja brasileira.

O Brasil é o maior exportador mundial de soja e carne bovina. As compras chinesas dispararam depois que o país asiático impôs tarifas sobre a soja dos EUA em resposta a outras tarifas anunciadas pelo presidente Donald Trump.

Independentemente de um acordo ser fechado, Yang disse que a demanda chinesa por soja brasileira permanece estável.

"Eu pessoalmente acho que não há necessidade de se preocupar", disse ele.

MAIS INVESTIMENTOS

O investimento chinês no Brasil atingiu uma máxima de sete anos em 2017, mas os números do ano passado, que não foram divulgados, devem apresentar queda, impactados por uma eleição imprevisível que viu a vitória do presidente Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro expressou ceticismo na campanha eleitoral sobre o aumento do investimento chinês no Brasil, mas Yang disse que teve uma longa reunião com o novo presidente em março, na qual Bolsonaro disse que se esforçaria para ampliar a cooperação bilateral.

O investimento chinês pode voltar a crescer em 2019, disse Yang, embora isso dependa, em parte, do plano de Bolsonaro de reativar o crescimento econômico com reformas previdenciárias e fiscais.

O embaixador disse que a empresa de telecomunicações chinesa Huawei Technologies estava "muito interessada" em colaborar com o Brasil no desenvolvimento da tecnologia de comunicação móvel de quinta geração (5G).

No entanto, decisões mais concretas precisariam esperar que o governo brasileiro anunciasse posições políticas sobre como a tecnologia deveria ser desenvolvida, disse ele.

Os Estados Unidos têm pressionado para impedir a Huawei de desenvolver a tecnologia 5G em países da Inglaterra à Austrália, dizendo que o equipamento da empresa poderia ser usado pelo Estado chinês para espionagem.

A Huawei nega essas alegações, e a China diz que os Estados Unidos não apresentaram provas concretas para respaldar seus argumentos.

Yang também disse que a estatal China Communications Construction e a China Railway Engineering Corp estão estudando propostas para as ferrovias Ferrogrão e Fiol, que o governo brasileiro planeja leiloar este ano.

President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump calls Sri Lankan prime minister following church bombings Ex-Trump lawyer: Mueller knew Trump had to call investigation a 'witch hunt' for 'political reasons' The biggest challenge from the Mueller Report depends on the vigilance of everyone MORE's approval rating is at 46 percent going into Thursday's expected release of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's report on Russia's election interference, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll.

The nationwide survey found that 22 percent of respondents said they "strongly approve" of the president's job in office, with 24 percent saying they "somewhat approve."

Trump's disapproval rating is at 53 percent — 38 percent say they "strongly disapprove" of Trump's job in office, and another 15 percent say they "somewhat disapprove."

The president's approval rating was unchanged from a Hill-HarrisX survey earlier this month, about a week after Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrEx-Trump lawyer: Mueller knew Trump had to call investigation a 'witch hunt' for 'political reasons' Trump pushes back on impeachment talk: 'Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!' The Hill's Morning Report - Is impeachment back on the table? MORE sent Congress his four-page summary of Mueller's findings, saying the special counsel did not find evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

Barr said Mueller did not take a position on whether there was obstruction of justice on the part of the president.

The Justice Department is slated to release a redacted version of the Mueller report.

HarrisX CEO Dritan Nesho told Hill.TV's Jamal Simmons on "What America's Thinking" that Trump's approval rating is being driven by issues, such as the economy.

“Voters tend to be driven as much by issues or more by issues than they are by personality,” Nesho said Wednesday. “Donald Trump gets pretty low scores on personal likability, but he does get pretty high scores on issues like the economy, stimulating jobs, and increasingly better scores on his handling of foreign policy, and his handling of terrorism."

"These are big driving factors both for his approval and the fact that nothing seems to really stick on the president," Nesho added.

The online survey was conducted April 15-16, among 1,000 registered voters. The sampling margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.

A new supercut video shows Fox News hosts slamming former President Barack Obama for the same actions that they either ignore or praise when it comes to President Donald Trump.

The footage, assembled by NowThis News, highlights personalities on the right-wing network attacking the former president for golfing, tweeting, executive actions, criticizing the press and being “almost obsessed with cable TV,” among other things. However, the footage was edited to remove Obama’s name ― and with that context excised, most of the commentary could just as easily refer to Trump:

What if Fox News covered Trump the way it covered Obama? It would look like this pic.twitter.com/dLfhHToieL — NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 16, 2019

The video features Fox News personalities who were on the air during the Obama years, and several are no longer with the network. Bill O’Reilly, for example, left in disgrace in 2017 amid New York Times reports that he spent a total of $45 million to settle multiple sexual harassment allegations.

Many of the hosts who’ve joined Fox News since then are very supportive of Trump. A few on the “news side” of the operation, including anchor Shep Smith, have been more critical of the president and the network’s hosts who uncritically support him.
The phone rang and the caller identified himself as Ryan Murphy. We had never met but I knew of him. Knew that he was considered an innovative force in television.

He told me about an idea he was working on. Something that hadn’t been done before on television. He wanted to create a role for me. A character unlike one I had played before. He made wild promises about how successful and well-received it was going to be. I’d been in this business long enough to take it all with a grain of salt. Yet his enthusiasm was contagious and the following year, once I made my debut in American Horror Story, everything he had promised came to pass. Just as he had predicted.

That is one of his great and seductive charms: the wonderful childlike enthusiasm he possesses. His sense of adventure and exploration, a boundless imagination, a brilliant mind and a wicked sense of humor.

During the time we’ve worked together, I’ve observed the great regard and curiosity he has for acting. The enjoyment he takes creating the characters and the stories they tell. Delighting in watching the actors bring them to life—an extension of his imagination. Ryan seems to possess a sixth sense of what you need and deserve as an actor. What would thrill you, and what kind of character could meet you head-on.

He is a born storyteller, and, like the best of them, he is constantly pushing the limits. I have often marveled at his uncanny ability at capturing the zeitgeist.

Ryan is an artist of unlimited creative power and talent. But, more importantly, he has a great heart and is a dear and fiercely loyal friend. My life is better for knowing him.

Scientists have established a link between religious fundamentalism and brain damage

Bobby Azarian, Raw Story 16 Apr 2019 at 13:59 ET

A study published in the journal Neuropsychologia has shown that religious fundamentalism is, in part, the result of a functional impairment in a brain region known as the prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that damage to particular areas of the prefrontal cortex indirectly promotes religious fundamentalism by diminishing cognitive flexibility and openness—a psychology term that describes a personality trait which involves dimensions like curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness.

Religious beliefs can be thought of as socially transmitted mental representations that consist of supernatural events and entities assumed to be real. Religious beliefs differ from empirical beliefs, which are based on how the world appears to be and are updated as new evidence accumulates or when new theories with better predictive power emerge. On the other hand, religious beliefs are not usually updated in response to new evidence or scientific explanations, and are therefore strongly associated with conservatism. They are fixed and rigid, which helps promote predictability and coherence to the rules of society among individuals within the group.

Religious fundamentalism refers to an ideology that emphasizes traditional religious texts and rituals and discourages progressive thinking about religion and social issues. Fundamentalist groups generally oppose anything that questions or challenges their beliefs or way of life. For this reason, they are often aggressive towards anyone who does not share their specific set of supernatural beliefs, and towards science, as these things are seen as existential threats to their entire worldview.

Since religious beliefs play a massive role in driving and influencing human behavior throughout the world, it is important to understand the phenomenon of religious fundamentalism from a psychological and neurological perspective.

To investigate the cognitive and neural systems involved in religious fundamentalism, a team of researchers—led by Jordan Grafman of Northwestern University—conducted a study that utilized data from Vietnam War veterans that had been gathered previously. The vets were specifically chosen because a large number of them had damage to brain areas suspected of playing a critical role in functions related to religious fundamentalism. CT scans were analyzed comparing 119 vets with brain trauma to 30 healthy vets with no damage, and a survey that assessed religious fundamentalism was administered. While the majority of participants were Christians of some kind, 32.5% did not specify a particular religion.

Based on previous research, the experimenters predicted that the prefrontal cortex would play a role in religious fundamentalism, since this region is known to be associated with something called ‘cognitive flexibility’. This term refers to the brain’s ability to easily switch from thinking about one concept to another, and to think about multiple things simultaneously. Cognitive flexibility allows organisms to update beliefs in light of new evidence, and this trait likely emerged because of the obvious survival advantage such a skill provides. It is a crucial mental characteristic for adapting to new environments because it allows individuals to make more accurate predictions about the world under new and changing conditions.

Brain imaging research has shown that a major neural region associated with cognitive flexibility is the prefrontal cortex—specifically two areas known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Additionally, the vmPFC was of interest to the researchers because past studies have revealed its connection to fundamentalist-type beliefs. For example, one study showed individuals with vmPFC lesions rated radical political statements as more moderate than people with normal brains, while another showed a direct connection between vmPFC damage and religious fundamentalism. For these reasons, in the present study, researchers looked at patients with lesions in both the vmPFC and the dlPFC, and searched for correlations between damage in these areas and responses to religious fundamentalism questionnaires.

According to Dr. Grafman and his team, since religious fundamentalism involves a strict adherence to a rigid set of beliefs, cognitive flexibility and open-mindedness present a challenge for fundamentalists. As such, they predicted that participants with lesions to either the vmPFC or the dlPFC would score low on measures of cognitive flexibility and trait openness and high on measures of religious fundamentalism.

The results showed that, as expected, damage to the vmPFC and dlPFC was associated with religious fundamentalism. Further tests revealed that this increase in religious fundamentalism was caused by a reduction in cognitive flexibility and openness resulting from the prefrontal cortex impairment. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using a standard psychological card sorting test that involved categorizing cards with words and images according to rules. Openness was measured using a widely-used personality survey known as the NEO Personality Inventory. The data suggests that damage to the vmPFC indirectly promotes religious fundamentalism by suppressing both cognitive flexibility and openness.

These findings are important because they suggest that impaired functioning in the prefrontal cortex—whether from brain trauma, a psychological disorder, a drug or alcohol addiction, or simply a particular genetic profile—can make an individual susceptible to religious fundamentalism. And perhaps in other cases, extreme religious indoctrination harms the development or proper functioning of the prefrontal regions in a way that hinders cognitive flexibility and openness.

The authors emphasize that cognitive flexibility and openness aren’t the only things that make brains vulnerable to religious fundamentalism. In fact, their analyses showed that these factors only accounted for a fifth of the variation in fundamentalism scores. Uncovering those additional causes, which could be anything from genetic predispositions to social influences, is a future research project that the researchers believe will occupy investigators for many decades to come, given how complex and widespread religious fundamentalism is and will likely continue to be for some time.

By investigating the cognitive and neural underpinnings of religious fundamentalism, we can better understand how the phenomenon is represented in the connectivity of the brain, which could allow us to someday inoculate against rigid or radical belief systems through various kinds of mental and cognitive exercises.




Jonathan Kongbo signed with Tennessee in 2016 as the nation’s No. 1 junior college prospect with three years of eligibility remaining.



Last season, he capped a career full of position changes, coaching changes and far more losses than he expected. As a senior in 2018, he made 11 tackles with four quarterback hurries and had an interception in the Vols’ upset win against Auburn. That same game, he tore his ACL, an injury that has sidelined him and slowed his ability to show off for NFL teams.



Kongbo recently spoke with The Athletic about his time in Knoxville. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.



How would you describe the last year at Tennessee?



I think the last year was a step toward a right direction for the program. Under Butch Jones, I just felt like there were a lot of people in administrative roles that shouldn’t be there. That shouldn’t be working with kids. They were just there for their own selfish...
A woman in a remote village carried out the first successful DIY caesarean section. "This is the one," says Ines Ramirez. From the corner of her one-roomed house, she picks up a wooden-handled knife with a six-inch blade. "I use it to cut fruit and vegetables now."

It is also the knife which Ines plunged into her womb and drew up her abdomen to carry out the world's only known successful, self-performed caesarean section. Today, she lies on the rough floor and demonstrates exactly how she gripped the knife on that night in remote, rural Mexico when she went into premature labour, five hours' travel from the nearest doctor.

Terrified lest the baby be still-born, as her previous one had been, Ines was determined to bring him into the world as quickly as possible. Fortified by two cups of almost 100 per cent proof alcohol, she grasped the knife by the blade rather than the handle, and used her index finger and thumb to apply pressure, as one would with a craft knife.

"I put the knife in here, then pulled it up," Ines says, pointing to her lower abdomen. "Once wasn't enough. I did it again. I was crying and screaming, in terrible pain." Lifting her skirt, she reveals a scar about seven inches long. "Then I cut open my womb and pulled the baby out by his feet. He cried straight away," For the first time in her company, Ines smiles.

A mother-of-eight, she lives in a hamlet in the Oaxaca region of Mexico. News of her remarkable do-it-yourself caesarean spread around the world only after the doctor who would eventually tend for the mother and her baby son, Orlando, was sent on attachment to a hospital in Chicago. An American colleague later wrote it up in the International Journal for Gynaecology and Obstetrics.

Ines emerges from her house, one of three small dwellings built of roughly made bricks that stand in a clearing of tierra colorada, the red earth common in the region, surrounded by a pine forest. A slim but sturdy woman about five feet tall, she is wearing a bright red dress and a green apron. Three young children are in attendance. Ines, 43, had her first child when she was 15.

Her house has bare walls and no furniture, though there is a black-and-white television in one corner. Electricity has recently arrived in her village of Rio Talea, but water has to be brought from a well. A fat pig forages among piles of chopped wood around the outdoor stove. Inside, Ramirez pounds maize on a slab of volcanic rock to make the tortillas that form the basis of the family's diet, enlivened by salsas of tomato, chilli and onion. In this remote district, meat is a rarity.

Today, as on the night Ines gave birth, there is no sign of a man around the house. "En el campo [in the countryside]," she shrugs. Gently pressed to elaborate, she replies again: "En el campo," suggesting that the children's father is an itinerant labourer, or perhaps a wood cutter who illegally fells trees at night.

Haltingly at first, Ines tells the remarkable story of how she gave birth. "I had seven children before Orlando," she says. "There was no problem with the births. But the eighth baby died. My waters broke and the midwife said I needed a caesarean but I couldn't get to the hospital in time. I felt the baby struggling but then it stopped moving.

"When I was seven months pregnant with Orlando, one night the pain began. It was terrible. I couldn't bear it. I started to panic. I knew I had to do something or this baby would die too. I knew I had to get it out somehow."

Her son Benito, who was then eight years old, was sent up the hill to a little shop half a mile away to buy a kitchen knife. "We had a knife but it wasn't that sharp." In her desperation not to lose another child, Ines cut into her womb as if cutting a tortilla. "Blood came out of me like a fountain." Pushing aside her internal organs, she rummaged around inside and pulled out her son. To her great joy, the baby cried, and appeared healthy, but Ines's ordeal was only just beginning. As mother and baby lay on the floor, Ines cut the umbilical cord before putting her organs back in place as best as she could. "It was all a mess," she remembers.

Her son, Benito, was sent off once again - this time to find a man with first-aid training. He arrived with a sewing needle and thread and attempted to stitch the wound. "Then he piled me into a pasajero [a rural mini-bus] and drove me to the clinic." The clinic was an hour's drive away along bumpy winding roads, in the village of San Lorenzo Texmelucan. "A lady doctor saw me," Ines continued. "She took one look and said, 'You've got to go to San Pedro'. They put me and the baby in the back of a pick-up truck."

The state hospital at San Pedro was another two-hour drive away down unpaved roads, on the main highway that links Oaxaca City to Puerto Escondido, a holiday resort on the Mexican coast. By this stage, her pain numbed only by the alcohol, Ines was near to collapse. "The lady doctor had phoned San Pedro and they'd sent an ambulance," she says. "I can hardly remember the rest."

Four years later - Orlando is now a healthy little boy who attends nursery school every day - Dr Onorio Galvan, head of the obstetrics department in the state hospital in San Pedro, remains astonished. "She was my star patient," he says. Switching on his computer, he plays a little clip of a small woman in a white hospital smock, carrying a baby in her arms. It is his reminder of the week - remarkably, she stayed no longer - that Ines spent in his hospital.

"I couldn't believe it," says Dr Galvan. "There was no sepsis in the wound, no internal bleeding. She was back on her feet in a couple of days." Five days later, she was on her way back home - by bus. Today, her younger children are charging around the house. Orlando, a bright-eyed boy, breaks into a run to catch up with his brother and sister, aged 12 and 13 respectively. He falls over, gets up, dusts himself down and carries on.

As for his mother, she still remembers how she brought Orlando home from hospital on that long bus journey. The bus followed a circuitous route through the hills to Ines's village. It was a 12-hour journey, so Ines didn't stay on board to its final destination. Reaching the mountains where she lives, she got off. With Orlando strapped to her back in a shawl, she walked for one and a half hours along footpaths to reach her home. "It was a short-cut," she explains.
Mark Taylor, the radical right-wing conspiracy theorist and so-called “firefighter prophet,” has begun issuing some genuinely alarming prophecies in recent weeks, warning that President Trump has been tasked by God to carry out divine justice by executing his political opponents.

Taylor, about whom Liberty University made a movie last year, appeared on “The MC Files” program on Monday night, where he doubled down on this prophecy, warning that leaders like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will soon be arrested and put to death and that anyone who dares to oppose Trump will be “standing in the way” of God’s will.

“God is going to serve justice,” Taylor said. “Justice is coming … [Obama] will be arrested. Justice will be served. Period. Hillary Clinton will be arrested, all these people, it’s coming.”

“There’s going to come a time when some of these people are just going to disappear,” he added. “We’re not going to hear anything and we may never know the truth, but the bottom line is they’re just going to disappear. Some may die, come down with some funky disease or have an accident, whatever the case may be, and we may never know the full truth on a lot of these people, but most of them will be in Gitmo.”

“People better get ready for this,” he continued. “If you don’t have a stomach for justice, you better get one quick because there’s going to be people in prison for life. You will see suicides to keep their reputations, and there will be people executed. Some of these people, we may never know they’ve been executed, they just may come down with a disease and all of a sudden they’re gone, very quietly, and just disappear. You better get a stomach for justice because justice is here.”

“To truly stop these treasonous acts, it’s going to take executing some of these people,” Taylor declared. “This is why Donald Trump was put there to begin with, to issue justice. You stand in the way of this, God will deal with you on your own because you don’t have the mind of God, you don’t have God’s interests at heart. If you’re trying to tell this president to not serve justice, you are standing in the way. You’ve been warned.”
Age restrictions on pornography will come into effect in July, the government has announced.

After 15 July, all internet users will be forced to prove themselves to be over 18 or be entirely blocked from seeing adult content.

Under the new rules, any commercial provider of online pornography will have to carry out “robust age-verification checks on users” to ensure they are adults.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

Those checks could include having internet users enter personal details into a privately owned database or buying a pass from newsagents. There will be a number of different ways for people to prove their age, the government said, all of which will be “rigorous” and are not simply typing in a date of birth or ticking a box.

If pornographic websites fail to comply with the rules, they could have payment services withdrawn or be blocked for all UK users.

The government says it has introduced the rules to stop children being damaged by pornographic content on the internet, which it says is too readily available.

“Adult content is currently far too easy for children to access online,” minister for digital Margot James said. “The introduction of mandatory age-verification is a world-first, and we’ve taken the time to balance privacy concerns with the need to protect children from inappropriate content. We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online, and these new laws will help us achieve this.”

But digital rights campaigners have strongly attacked the new rules, arguing they represent a severe limit on the way the internet works and could compromise the privacy of the people who cooperate with them.

“The government needs to compel companies to enforce privacy standards,” said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group. “The idea that they are ‘optional’ is dangerous and irresponsible.

“Having some age verification that is good and other systems that are bad is unfair and a scammer’s paradise – of the government’s own making.

“Data leaks could be disastrous. And they will be the government’s own fault.

“The government needs to shape up and legislate for privacy before their own policy results in people being outed, careers destroyed or suicides being provoked.”

The new rules will be enforced by the British Board of Film Classification, the organisation that rates films that are shown and sold in the UK. The BBFC will give websites an implementation period before 15 July to ensure they have time to comply with the new standards.

“The introduction of age-verification to restrict access to commercial pornographic websites to adults is a ground-breaking child protection measure. Age-verification will help prevent children from accessing pornographic content online and means the UK is leading the way in internet safety,” said BBFC chief executive David Austin.

“On entry into force, consumers will be able to identify that an age-verification provider has met rigorous security and data checks if they carry the BBFC’s new green ‘AV’ symbol.”

The BBFC was given the job of regulating online pornography in February 2018, and has been attempting to figure out how the wide-ranging checks could work ever since.

The Internet Service Providers’ Association said that internet companies may be asked to entirely ban websites that don’t comply with the rules, but that it expected most pornography providers to do so.

“ISPs have an enforcement role in this policy to block websites that do not comply with these regulations and it is important to clarify that ISP blocking will only be used as a last resort,” said Andrew Glover, the chair of the IPSA. ”Our members are expecting high levels of compliance from online pornography providers, and it is the role of the regulator, the BBFC, to ensure that these sites remain committed to age verification”
As a genetic material, DNA is responsible for all known life. But DNA is also a polymer. Tapping into the unique nature of the molecule, Cornell engineers have created simple machines constructed of biomaterials with properties of living things.

Using what they call DASH (DNA-based Assembly and Synthesis of Hierarchical) materials, Cornell engineers constructed a DNA material with capabilities of metabolism, in addition to self-assembly and organization – three key traits of life.

“We are introducing a brand-new, lifelike material concept powered by its very own artificial metabolism. We are not making something that’s alive, but we are creating materials that are much more lifelike than have ever been seen before,” said Dan Luo , professor of biological and environmental engineering in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

The paper, “Dynamic DNA Material With Emergent Locomotion Behavior Powered by Artificial Metabolism,” published April 10 in Science Robotics.

For any living organism to maintain itself, there must be a system to manage change. New cells must be generated; old cells and waste must be swept away. Biosynthesis and biodegradation are key elements of self-sustainability and require metabolism to maintain its form and functions.

Through this system, DNA molecules are synthesized and assembled into patterns in a hierarchical way, resulting in something that can perpetuate a dynamic, autonomous process of growth and decay.

Using DASH, the Cornell engineers created a biomaterial that can autonomously emerge from its nanoscale building blocks and arrange itself – first into polymers and eventually mesoscale shapes. Starting from a 55-nucleotide base seed sequence, the DNA molecules were multiplied hundreds of thousands times, creating chains of repeating DNA a few millimeters in size. The reaction solution was then injected in a microfluidic device that provided a liquid flow of energy and the necessary building blocks for biosynthesis.

As the flow washed over the material, the DNA synthesized its own new strands, with the front end of the material growing and the tail end degrading in optimized balance. In this way, it made its own locomotion, creeping forward, against the flow, in a way similar to how slime molds move.

The locomotive ability allowed the researchers to pit sets of the material against one another in competitive races. Due to randomness in the environment, one body would eventually gain an advantage over the other, allowing one to cross a finish line first.

“The designs are still primitive, but they showed a new route to create dynamic machines from biomolecules. We are at a first step of building lifelike robots by artificial metabolism,” said Shogo Hamada , lecturer and research associate in the Luo lab, and lead and co-corresponding author of the paper. “Even from a simple design, we were able to create sophisticated behaviors like racing. Artificial metabolism could open a new frontier in robotics.”

The engineers are currently exploring ways to have the material recognize stimuli and autonomously be able to seek it out in the case of light or food, or avoid it if it’s harmful.

The programmed metabolism embedded into DNA materials is the key innovation. The DNA contains the set of instructions for metabolism and autonomous regeneration. After that, it’s on its own.

“Everything from its ability to move and compete, all those processes are self-contained. There’s no external interference,” Luo said. “Life began billions of years from perhaps just a few kinds of molecules. This might be the same.”

The material the team created can last for two cycles of synthesis and degradation before it expires. Longevity can likely be extended, according to the researchers, opening the possibility for more “generations” of the material as it self-replicates. “Ultimately, the system may lead to lifelike self-reproducing machines,” Hamada said.

“More excitingly, the use of DNA gives the whole system a self-evolutionary possibility,” Luo said. “That is huge.”

Theoretically, it could be designed so that subsequent generations emerge within seconds. Reproduction at this hyper pace would take advantage of DNA’s natural mutational properties and speed the evolutionary process, according to Luo.

In the future, the system could be used as a biosensor to detect the presence of any DNA and RNA. The concept also could be used to create a dynamic template for making proteins without living cells.

The work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and supported by the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility and Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science . Collaborators include Jenny Sabin, the Arthur L. and Isabel B. Wiesenberger Professor in Architecture, and researchers form Shanghai Jiaotong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

More than half of chicken meat sold at low-cost supermarkets in Germany is contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, according to a probe of meat samples.

The environmental and consumer organization Germanwatch described the results of their study on Tuesday as "an alarmingly high resistance rate" that shows the overuse of antibiotics in industrial poultry production is endangering human health.

Germanwatch had 59 chicken meat samples from large discount supermarkets analyzed at a university lab and found that 56% were colonized by antibiotic-resistant germs. The meat samples came from the four largest slaughterhouses in Germany.

Responding to the study, the Federal Agriculture Ministry said it "suggests that too many antibiotics are used in the poultry industry."

Bacteria-fighting drugs have become less effective due to overuse in humans and animals as bacteria adapt and evolve. The more antibiotics are used, the greater bacteria are able to boost their defenses.

Read more: German scientists find antibiotic-resistant germs in lakes, streams

Alarmingly, the study found that one-third of chicken meat samples from discount supermarkets Lidl, Netto, Real, Aldi and Penny were contaminated with bacteria resistant to so-called reserve antibiotics.

Reserve antibiotics are fourth-generation and fifth-generation drugs used as a last resort to fight superbugs resistant to traditional antibiotics.

Experts said that bacteria are killed when chicken is properly cooked, but that humans can become sick or even die through cross-contamination with uncooked foods in the kitchen, such as on a cutting board. Workers at industrial chicken farms can also be exposed to germs through inhalation.

Antibiotic resistant microbes can contaminate uncooked foods in the kitchen

Probes of 12 chicken meat samples from small-scale farmers were also conducted and only one was found to have antibiotic-resistant germs. In another analysis, six samples from ecological farms found no resistant pathogens.

Germanwatch linked the differing results to the overuse of antibiotics at industrial poultry farms.

The situation will only improve if the government prohibits veterinarians from prescribing antibiotics to "compensate for the consequences of catastrophic housing conditions and turbo-breeding in the production of cheap meat," Germanwatch said.

Although German poultry farmers have halved their antibiotic consumption since 2011, it is still twice as high as in Denmark, Great Britain or Austria, according to the environmental and consumer organization.

Germanwatch demanded that the use of antibiotics at poultry farms be dramatically reduced and that chicken meat be labeled as coming from industrial farms to better inform consumers.

Mike Myers is set to star in and executive produce a new comedy series at Netflix, Variety has learned exclusively. The half-hour series, which has received a six-episode order, will feature Myers portraying multiple characters.

“I love creating characters, and Netflix has given me a fantastic playground to play in,” Myers said.

Myers first broke out as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live.” During his time on the long-running NBC sketch series, he originated popular characters like Wayne Campbell of “Wayne’s World,” “Sprockets” host Dieter, and Lothar of the Hill People. Myers went on to have a very successful film career, including starring in two “Wayne’s World” films alongside fellow “SNL” alum Dana Carvey. He also starred in the hit “Austin Powers” and “Shrek” film franchises, and recently appeared in the Oscar-winning film “Bohemian Rhapsody.” Myers also serves as executive producer and host of ABC’s revival of “The Gong Show,” appearing onscreen as the character Tommy Maitland.

He is repped by WME and Untitled Entertainment.

In addition to Myers, John Lyons and Jason Weinberg will also serve as executive producers on the untitled series, with Mackenzie Cyr and Justin Capraro-Gentuso serving as associate producers. Lyons previously executive produced “Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” and “Austin Powers in Goldmember,” while Weinberg is an executive producer on “The Gong Show.”
During a podcast for Yahoo News, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asked for the “top three” charges against Donald Trump that she would want to see in any articles of impeachment, and as you can see, it didn’t go well.

In summary, it’s emoluments, tax fraud for which she has no evidence and . . . wait for it . . . the census and tax reform legislation that passed both the House and the Senate. That’s right: She wants to impeach Donald Trump because he lowered taxes:

.@AOC's Top 3 articles of impeachment? (1) emoluments; (2) tax fraud she feels; and, (3) so much stuff, like, the census and tax cuts.

O senador Alessandro Vieira (Cidadania-SE) afirmou, nesta terça-feira (16), que pedirá o impeachment do presidente do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), Dias Toffoli, e do ministro Alexandre de Moraes, por crime de responsabilidade e abuso de autoridade. Outros senadores, como Randolfe Rodrigues (Rede-AP) e Lasier Martins (PODE-RS), já confirmam que vão assinar o pedido junto com Vieira.

Toffoli e Moraes são responsáveis, na Corte, por um inquérito aberto pelo próprio STF, há um mês, para apurar ataques à honra dos ministros do tribunal. A procuradora-geral da República (PGR), Raquel Dodge, se manifestou nesta terça pelo arquivamento da investigação, que tem sido alvo crescente de protestos de autoridades e nas redes sociais desde a última segunda, quando Moraes determinou censura a uma reportagem que citava o presidente da Corte.

Para Vieira, que também é o autor do pedido de criação de uma CPI para investigar tribunais superiores (a chamada CPI Lava Toga), a investigação cometeu ilegalidades na última segunda (15), ao censurar uma reportagem da revista Crusoé e do site O Antagonista que citava Toffoli, e também nesta terça, ao ordenar buscas relacionadas a sete pessoas que "apenas emitiram opiniões em redes sociais" contra o Supremo, na avaliação do parlamentar.

A manifestação de Dodge para arquivar o inquérito significa, segundo Vieira, um freio a um caso de abuso de poder. Na avaliação do senador, os dois ministros usurparam de sua competência. "O que Toffoli e Alexandre de Moraes foi criminoso", critica.

O senador afirma que o Supremo se apequena ao manter os dois ministros no cargo. "O Supremo fica do tamanho desses ministros, inexistente praticamente. Fica todo mundo no mesmo saco, comprometendo as instituições", afirma.

Assim que for protocolado, este será o décimo terceiro pedido de impeachment de ministros do Supremo protocolado no Senado. Um levantamento do Congresso em Foco, publicado na última quinta, mostrou que só neste ano já haviam sido protocolados sete pedidos, somados a outros cinco que ainda estão em tramitação. Toffoli e o ministro Gilmar Mendes são os principais alvos, com três pedidos individuais contra cada um. (Veja a lista com todos os pedidos ao final da matéria).

A decisão de dar andamento a algum destes pedidos cabe exclusivamente ao presidente do Senado, Davi Alcolumbre (DEM-AP). Um projeto de lei apresentado por Lasier Martins, no entanto, busca desengavetar as denúncias. Pela proposta, Alcolumbre passaria a ter um prazo de 15 dias para emitir parecer favorável ou contrário à aceitação de pedido de impeachment, e a decisão final caberia ao plenário.

CPI Lava Toga

Alessandro Vieira considera que uma CPI para investigar os tribunais superiores se torna, a cada dia, mais urgente e necessária.

"Precisamos resgatar a credibilidade da mais alta corte do Judiciário brasileiro. É preciso que a pressão popular chegue ao Congresso", defende. Embora comemore a decisão de Dodge, o senador, que é delegado da Polícia Federal, diz ver com estranheza o fato de a procuradora-geral ter determinado, em vez de recomendado, o arquivamento do inquérito aberto por Toffoli.

"Quem teria de arquivar era o Judiciário, não o Ministério Público. Enfim, está tudo errado", diz. "Qualquer estudante de Direito sabia que esse inquérito era absolutamente arbitrário e equivocado", acrescenta.

Watching the coverage of The Barr Letter unfold was to learn, once again, that we are truly fucked. Here was a four-page "summary" of The Mueller Report from an attorney general who was hired after he wrote a 19-page memo attacking the Mueller probe, a summary that contained four incomplete sentences from the actual report. This attorney general had a record of getting involved in the process of defusing Republican presidential scandals like Iran-Contra during his last stint as attorney general, and misled Congress when he released a "summary" of an internal Justice Department memo in 1989.

Yet for some reason—even though the president and his administration lie constantly, he fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to protect him from the probe, he hired the acting attorney general before Barr, Matthew Whitaker, because he saw the guy attacking the Russia investigation on television, and he openly admitted he'd installed Whitaker over the investigation—most people seemed to just accept William Barr's word for it.

The Mainstream Media, having learned nothing from the Both Sides era or two years of being lied to constantly, basically accepted its beating from Trump and his allies. The New York Goddamn Times suggested in a headline that "A Cloud Over Trump's Presidency Is Lifted"—even though reporter Peter Baker, in that very article, said the actual report "may yet disclose damning information if made public." Leftist journalists on the anti-anti-Russia beat, some of whom launched their careers on the premise of seeking government transparency and assailing corruption and questioning the motives of anyone in the United States security apparatus, readily accepted the word of the United States attorney general Donald Trump had installed a month earlier.

In the latter case, it was a chance to crow vindication, having for months claimed too many reporters digging into The Russian Connection had jumped to conclusions based on the first evidence that supported their desired narrative. (Sound familiar?) But when it comes to the cowed Mainstream Media, it was all down to fear and political pressure. Trump and his allies in the conservative infotainment vortex declared total victory and slammed The Very Fake News for its biased reporting, trying to completely redraw the battlefield in a public-relations blitzkrieg.

The basis for this was that The Barr Letter announced no one in Trump's orbit would be charged with conspiring in the Russian government's influence campaign in the 2016 election—a narrow and specific allegation—and Barr himself had decided there was no obstruction case. (Mueller made no such decision, which Barr admitted in the letter, which explicitly said the report Does Not Exonerate.) Never mind that this was always more likely to be a case of corruption and white-collar crime, not some international spy caper, and that the report may contain behavior that is unacceptable and compromising for an elected official. There was no mention of the Trump Tower Meeting, the Trump Tower Moscow deal, or the fact that Trump's campaign manager was passing campaign polling data to an associate linked to Russian intelligence services. None of these events, which we know about thanks to reporting from the Mainstream Media, have been explained or disproven.

Shut up! NO COLLUSION!

In recent days and weeks, however, the full-court press from Trump and his allies has shown a few passing lanes. Barr shied away from his initial characterization of his letter as a "summary," trying to muddy the waters about what, exactly, he'd produced for the public. He refuses to send a full and un-redacted version of the report to the House Judiciary Committee in Congress, despite it dealing with classified intel all the time. After sitting quietly for a while in the hopes someone would demonstrate an ounce of integrity here, members of Mueller's team have gone public to tell The New York Times that Barr "failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated."

And Trump, having declared the letter meant he was TOTALLY EXONERATED!—and made mouth noises about how he wanted the full actual report released—has returned to more familiar refrains now that a version of the report, albeit one with redactions made by Barr, is set to be released on Thursday.

The Mueller Report, which was written by 18 Angry Democrats who also happen to be Trump Haters (and Clinton Supporters), should have focused on the people who SPIED on my 2016 Campaign, and others who fabricated the whole Russia Hoax. That is, never forget, the crime..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019

....Since there was no Collusion, why was there an Investigation in the first place! Answer - Dirty Cops, Dems and Crooked Hillary! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019

If you're keeping score at home, the people who wrote a report that TOTALLY EXONERATES! the president are angry Democrats and dirty cops who have a vendetta against the president. Also, again: Mueller is a registered Republican, not that it matters.

A must read, Andy McCarthy’s column today, “Dirty dealings of dirt devils who concocted Trump-Russia probe.” The greatest Scam in political history. If the Mainstream Media were honest, which they are not, this story would be bigger and more important than Watergate. Someday! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2019

So these folks hatched the "greatest Scam in political history"—a plot to take down the president—and then, when it came time to issue their Final Report, they completely EXONERATED him? That seems like an almighty waste of time.

No Collusion - No Obstruction! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2019

Play the hits! Wait, I thought The Barr Letter accurately summarized The Mueller Report, which already proved this is true? Why would the president need to restate it two days before a redacted version of the report is set to be released, and the public will see he's vindicated? He later supplemented this with another tweet boasting the same caption, but this time attached to a video from Fox News featuring Ken Starr. What a time to be alive.

Anyone who took The Barr Letter at face value when it was released deserves every ounce of egg that may or may not be headed towards their faces. If you've watched Donald Trump and his minions for the last three years and still expect that they are telling the truth when they speak publicly, you're something beyond Charlie Brown with the football. Did these folks not notice that The Caravan, an existential threat to the America we know and love, disappeared right after the 2018 midterms? Did they not notice that a raft of senior Trump advisers used private email to conduct government business, a crime that, during the 2016 election, the same people had suggested was something close to treason?

It is a terrifying indictment of our national press that so many professional observers have failed to internalize that the president and his allies are not acting in good faith, and that they have no regard for whether something is true—only whether it will help them if enough people believe it. Folks went along with their initial declaration of Total Victory. They went along with Trump as he drew the new lines on the field: if it wasn't outright conspiracy with a hostile foreign power, it doesn't matter, even if I have some shady and possibly compromising business entanglements. If the press does not adapt to the new rules of this game, and accept that they have control over how things are framed and whether dishonest people get to do the framing, it does not bode well for the future of this country.


Academy Award-winning actress Charlize Theron recently spoke about being “shockingly available” and was waiting for someone to “step up” and date her — but she seems to have rescinded on those claims.

Theron is now saying that she is not currently looking for love. She told Extra in a new interview: “I’m gonna finish this press tour then I’m gonna shoot a movie in London, and I’m figuring like around September we’ll talk about this.”

Theron is currently set to star in “Long Shot,” a romantic comedy featuring Seth Rogen as her love counterpart.

CHARLIZE THERON SHARES PHOTO FROM FIRST-EVER MODELING COMPETITION

“The idea of working with Seth was something I was really excited about… I read the script and I saw a lot of potential for us to go and do something that could work with the two of us that in a way — for me, not so much for him — felt like a real challenge,” Theron stated on working with Rogen.

As a single mother, Theron stated, “Like every working mom out there, you go through periods when you are overwhelmed, and I'm in one of those right now.”

When asked about her emotional state, she stated, “I don't cry. I do cry. I take that back… I cry at anything related to my kids. For sure. But I don't cry about being overwhelmed.”

“There is always light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.

CHARLIZE THERON AND BRAD PITT DATING AFTER MEETING THROUGH HER EX SEAN PENN: REPORT

Theron dated Stuart Townsend until they split in 2010 and more recently was engaged to fellow Academy Award winner Sean Penn, but they broke up in 2015.

Earlier this year, rumors swirled that Theron and Brad Pitt were dating after they met through Penn. However, a source denied to People magazine the two were seeing each other.

“About six months ago, they did a shoot together,” a source told People. “They have spent time together.”

"Long Shot" is set to be released in theaters on May 3.
The Army, Navy and Air Force are finalizing plans to eliminate over the next few years more than 17,000 uniformed medical billets -- physicians, dentists, nurses, technicians, medics and support personnel.

The reduction will allow those billets to be repurposed as war fighters or combat-support skills to increase lethality and size of operational units. Another goal is to deepen the workload of remaining medical billets at base hospitals and clinics to strengthen medical skills and also to improve quality of care for beneficiaries, defense officials explained.

One senior service official shared the latest figures he has seen showing the uniformed Army medical staff falling by almost 7,300, the Navy by almost 5,300 and the Air Force by just over 5,300.

Spread across a combined medical force of 130,000, both active-duty and reserve, the planned cuts would lower uniformed medical strength by roughly 13 percent, a drop steep enough to alarm some health care leaders as well as advocates for military health care beneficiaries.

"If the goal is to tear down the military health system, this would be a reasonable way to do it," warned one service health official who asked not to be identified.

Given the numbers involved, said retired Navy Capt. Kathryn M. Beasley, director of government relations for health issues at the Military Officers Association of America, the staff cuts eyed are worrisome for patient access, particularly to physicians young families rely on such as pediatricians and obstetricians.

"We need to see the final numbers to understand the impact," she said.

But senior defense officials, who say they collaborated closely with the services on overall staff reduction plans, contend the current force is larger than needed to meet today's operational missions and is overloaded with skill sets not useful for deployment and delivering of battlefield care.

Also, they contend, the oversized staffs harm quality of care because, at too many base hospitals and clinics, these care providers don't treat enough patients to keep skills sharp.

"So, part of this drill is to realign our people to the appropriate level of workload so that their skills, both for battlefield care and for beneficiary care, improve," said one Defense Department official.

Top defense officials agreed to discuss reasons behind the planned staff cuts for the military health care system, but declined to confirm any numbers for medical slots targeted, which some service officials did share, because no figures will be firm until the fiscal 2020 defense budget request is approved by the White House and sent to Congress in February.

If Congress approves the cuts, to be presented billet by billet, the reductions would begin to take effect in fiscal 2021.

Preliminary Navy documents show uniformed staff at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center falling by 534 personnel, with, for example, 82 taken from director of clinical support, including 28 of 39 corpsmen, 5 of 12 radiological diagnosticians, 4 of 7 pharmacists, 8 of 19 pharmacy techs, and 9 of 45 medical lab technicians.

Defense officials described a year-long collaboration between service medical departments, the Joint Chiefs, the Defense Health Agency and CAPE, the Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation Office of the Secretary of Defense. The force cuts are just one part of an enormous transformation occurring across military medicine.

Control of all medical facilities is being transferred to the Defense Health Agency (DHA), where functions of the three separate service medical departments already are being consolidated to streamline health care operations, slash support costs and standardize practices and procedures, from scheduling appointments to reporting on provider errors. Meanwhile, the military health system is adopting MHS Genesis, a new electronic health record system.

Just as Congress directed these changes, it told the secretary of defense in its fiscal 2017 National Defense Department Authorization Act to collaborate with service branches on defining medical and dental personnel requirements to ensure operational readiness, and to convert military medical positions to civilian positions if deemed unnecessary to meet operational readiness needs.

The medical force reduction effort, however, isn't being funded for a mass conversion of military billets to civilian medical positions. Instead, the emphasis is on providing more effective and efficient care, on battlefields and through military treatment facilities to troops, families and retirees, using smaller staffs that are sized to gain more experience and be better trained for military operations.

To understand what's about to happen, said a senior official familiar with the staff cut plans, it is helpful to grasp a notion that sounds counterintuitive: "Reducing the number of people providing a particular service within a facility does not mean a degradation of care within that facility."

A "truism in the medical arena," he added, "is that the more times a provider performs a procedure, the better that provider is at performing that procedure."

If a military hospital now staffed with five orthopedic surgeons performs 10 knee replacements a month, that's only two operations per surgeon. If staff is cut to one surgeon able to still comfortably perform 10 procedures a month, both quality of patient care and the readiness of that surgeon for war will improve.

That argument for a careful reduction of staff isn't persuasive to some career medical personnel.

One said he is worried that staff cuts this deep could leave hospitals short of personnel to deploy or to receive patients if old wars escalate or new ones break out in Korea, Eastern Europe or the South China Sea. He also worries about finding civilian replacements when needed, noting chronic staff shortages within the Department of Veterans Affairs medical system that can't be filled even in peacetime.

"I don't believe it's doable when you take your platforms down to this degree and you're still putting people on [forward] deployment schedules," said this senior service official. "You can argue on the margins whether you need quite as many people here or there. But these hospitals support training as well as provide care and [they] keep people in operational units."

After deep staff cuts, "you're going to have a very hard time keeping docs, especially in uniform," he said.

Ironically, he added, these staff cut plans arise near the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan where U.S. military medicine produced "the best outcomes in combat casualty care in the history of the world."

Senior defense officials answered such concerns with assurances DHA and the services are giving careful consideration to readiness needs, including wartime requirements. Military facilities still will have robust civilian staffs, they added, and will be able to backfill with reserve medical personnel and civilian contracts.

Officials conceded the staff cuts, and refocusing on deployable skills, over time will change the mix of providers delivering care on base, forcing more family care off base and onto Tricare provider networks.

"We will expect to see an increase in certain skill sets [and] a decrease in other skill sets. More trauma surgeons, fewer pediatricians, for example. Those kinds of changes are right at the heart of what Congress has directed us to do," said one official.

The same shift in medical skill sets for hospital staffs will begin to reshape graduate medical education pipelines.

"The reason why we do graduate medical education is to be able to supply that ready medical force," said another senior official. "We need to expand our capacity in some areas" but will see them "contract" in others.

Some critics of the staff cuts suggest a desire for budget savings is a key factor. Navy documents identify "expected total savings of $1.14 billion" from that service's uniformed medical "end-strength divestiture" plan.

Senior defense officials deny that's the case, citing an "unwavering commitment" to improving medical readiness and quality of care.

"How do we get higher levels of medical readiness for the next major conflict? That central question is going to drive a lot of changes throughout the military health care system."

In the wake of Notre Dame's inferno, while many hope to see that magnificent landmark to God grace the Parisian skyline once again, others see the burning of the iconic Catholic cathedral in a far different light. Take the recent response by Rolling Stone, for example, which promotes a quote from an architect hailing the fire as "an act of liberation."

"How should France rebuild Notre Dame?" the Rolling Stone's E.J. Dickson asks in the title of an op-ed published Tuesday. Rather than give the obvious answer – exactly as it was – Dickson goes on to flirt with the idea of Notre Dame becoming something else, forever ridding it of the meaning that so many people ascribe to it, which the article suggests is some kind of pathological clinging to a past-that-never-was.

"The damage wrought by the Notre Dame fire has also raised important questions about the cathedral’s symbolic significance in an increasingly divided France, and how to rebuild (or which version of the cathedral should be rebuilt) going forward — and in some ways, these questions are one and the same," writes Dickson.

While the author notes the vast, incalculable historical significance that Notre Dame holds, Dickson also highlights the modernists who feel "resentment" toward the cathedral, wondering if the rebuilding will meet their cultural needs as well.

"For some people in France, Notre Dame has also served as a deep-seated symbol of resentment, a monument to a deeply flawed institution and an idealized Christian European France that arguably never existed in the first place," writes Dickson. "If nothing else, the cathedral has been viewed by some as a stodgy reminder of 'the old city — the embodiment of the Paris of stone and faith — just as the Eiffel Tower exemplifies the Paris of modernity, joie de vivre and change,' Michael Kimmelmann wrote for the New York Times."

To underscore this, Dickson includes a quote from Harvard University architecture historian Patricio del Real, who said the cathedral had become "overburdened with meeting" and referred to the scourge of fire as an "act of liberation."

"The building was so overburdened with meaning that its burning feels like an act of liberation," said Patricio del Real.

To really drive the point home, Rolling Stone chose to highlight the quote in promoting the article on Twitter, which prompted swift backlash.

Fortunately, French politicians have stayed away from politicizing Notre Dame in such a way. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced the cathedral will be even "more beautiful" and has called for it to be rebuilt in five years.

"The fire at Notre Dame reminds us that our history never stops and we will always have challenges to overcome," Macron said on Tuesday night, The Guardian reports. "We will rebuild Notre Dame, more beautiful than before – and I want it done in the next five years. We can do it. After the time of testing comes a time of reflection and then of action."

Experts speculate, however, the rebuilding of Notre Dame could take decades to rebuild. For instance, the roof was comprised of oak beams cut from centuries-old trees that likely do not even exist in Europe today.

"Some of that material may be reusable, and that’s a painstaking exercise. It’s like an archaeological excavation," Duncan Wilson, chief executive of the conservation organization Historic England, told the The Guardian.

It’s official: Keldon Johnson will remain in the 2019 NBA Draft.

Back on April 10th, Johnson announced his intention to “test the waters” in the NBA draft process. Apparently, the water felt fine because he has made a pretty quick decision about his basketball future. On Wednesday, he announced his intentions to keep his name in the draft and put an end to his college eligibility.

It's his time. Keldon Johnson is officially staying in the NBA Draft and forgoing his remaining eligibility at Kentucky. There are few people who love this game as much as he does nor work as hard at it. We know he's got a long career ahead of him. Make us proud, KJ.#DreamBIG pic.twitter.com/vlQ9oomPCt — Kentucky Basketball (@KentuckyMBB) April 17, 2019

Johnson joined the Kentucky Wildcats as the top freshman in the 2018 class. He led the Wildcats in scoring for most of the season, but in the last month he was surpassed by both PJ Washington and Tyler Herro, who have also decided to keep their names in the draft.

Some believe that, by fading in the background toward the end of the season, Johnson may not be ready for the jump to the NBA. But NBA executives must disagree as they have given Johnson the feedback he was looking for to make the decision to give up his college eligibility before the NBA Draft combine.

Johnson’s departure has been anticipated really since he first arrived on campus. And given that the majority of the incoming class are wing players, it seems that John Calipari knew this result was inevitable.

Johnson has been ranked anywhere from No. 10 to the mid-20’s in mock drafts throughout the season. The most recent editions have slated him in the late-teens to early-20’s. When he made his NBA declaration announcement, Johnson was open about his desire to be selected in the lottery portion of the first round.

Has a team guaranteed that he will be taken that early? Or is Johnson just willing to roll the dice based on what he has heard so far? His NBA destination will be revealed at the draft on Thursday, June 20th.

Atlus is currently working on multiple Persona 5 related projects and have been slowly releasing new information. Late last month they revealed the full name for Persona 5 R which ended up being Persona 5: The Royal, they also showed off a trailer which promised more information on April 24. Earlier this month the official website for Persona 5 S was updated, which also promised more information coming in on April 25, a day after the other game.

Luckily for all fans we’ve have managed to get some exclusive information from our sources on Persona 5: The Royal, Persona 5 S and Persona 5 A. Here’s what we know so far:

Persona 5: The Royal

Is an enhanced version of the original game with new content

There’s a “very lengthy new epilogue”

New characters integral to the story, including the girl seen in the previous trailer

There will be a Female MC (who is not the girl from the trailer)

New Personas and Social Links

The source claimed the game will have “a ton of new content”

PS4 Exclusive

Atlus wanted a (simultaneous) worldwide release but that won’t be possible due to the sheer amount of new content

Persona 5 S

The source has heard that Atlus has been working on a direct Persona 5 port for the Switch, which will not feature the enhancements of Persona 5: The Royal

There is however talk of some Nintendo exclusive content

Persona 5 A

The source claims that an Arena title for Persona 5 has been in the works for a while now

The assumed Persona 5 Arena was supposed to release sooner but developer Arc System Works was too busy with Dragon Ball FighterZ and its post release content

Now the studio is finishing up Granblue Fantasy Versus for Cygames, which set to release later this year for PS4

Apparently a small team is working on the game right now, with full development to be initiated after the Granblue Fantasy Versus project is completed

The game will run on an iteration of the Dragon Ball FighterZ engine (which supports the Switch)

There you have it, that’s all we know about the Persona projects right now. Make sure to mark April 24 and 25 on your calendars for more information directly from Atlus.

Disclaimer: We would like to clarify that we are not saying the fighting game will be called Persona 5 A or Persona 5 Arena. We just know there is a new Persona fighting game in development and used the title ‘Arena’ since it was familiar.
Den Preis für die letzte Meile der Telekom auf Basis aktueller Tiefbau- und Kupferpreise zu berechnen, nennt der Breko absurd. Die realen Kosten seien eine sinnvolle Grundlage.

Der Bundesverband Breitbandkommunikation (Breko) hat die vorgeschlagene Preiserhöhung für die Teilnehmeranschlussleitung (TAL) auf der letzten Meile kritisiert. "Das Absurde daran ist, dass die Telekom seit Jahren keinen Meter Kupferkabel mehr verlegt und keine einzige Tiefbaumaßnahme zur Verlegung von Kupferleitungen mehr veranlasst haben dürfte", sagte Breko-Geschäftsführer Stephan Albers am 17. April 2019. Dennoch stelle die Bundesnetzagentur die Telekom in ihren Genehmigungsentscheidungen so, als wenn sie das Kupfernetz jedes Mal wieder neu errichten würde.

Stellenmarkt AraCom IT Services AG, Augsburg, München, Stuttgart, Bamberg Veridos GmbH, München

Die Deutsche Telekom soll künftig für die Bereitstellung der Teilnehmeranschlussleitungen (TAL) deutlich mehr Geld verlangen dürfen. Nach dem Vorschlag der Bundesnetzagentur soll vom 1. Juli 2019 an der Preis für die Anmietung der Leitung vom Hauptverteiler zum Kunden (HVt-TAL) von derzeit 10,02 Euro auf 11,19 Euro steigen. Das entspräche einem Anstieg von fast zwölf Prozent. Der Preis für den Anschluss ab Kabelverzweiger (KVz-TAL) soll um vier Prozent von 6,77 Euro auf 7,05 Euro steigen.

Seit 1999 ist der Preis für die Bereitstellung der HVz-TAL kontinuierlich von 12,99 Euro auf derzeit 10,02 Euro gesunken. Der neuerliche Anstieg erklärt sich jedoch aus der Berechnungsmethode, die auf den Kosten für den hypothetischen Neubau der Leitungen im Tiefbau und Anstieg der Kupferpreise basiert.

Wenig Anreize, in reine Glasfasernetze zu investieren

"Auf diese Weise spendieren die Wettbewerber über die Zugangsentgelte zur letzten Meile den Büchern der Telekom alle drei Jahre ein neues Kupfernetz. Die Bundesnetzagentur sollte sich überlegen, ob sie im Glasfaserzeitalter die richtigen Ausbauanreize setzt", sagte Albers. "Solange die Telekom jede ihrer vollständig abgeschriebenen Kupferleitungen von den Wettbewerbern mit über 11 beziehungsweise 7 Euro entgolten bekommt, hat sie wenig Anreize, in reine Glasfasernetze zu investieren."

Der Breko spricht sich dafür aus, die Problematik des "Wiederbeschaffungsansatzes" der Bundesnetzagentur im Rahmen der laufenden Überarbeitung des Telekommunikationsgesetzes (TKG) zu lösen. Besser sei zugrunde zu legen, welche "tatsächlichen Kosten" die Telekom aktuell für das Kupfernetz habe. Dies betreffe Betrieb und Erhaltung durch Reparatur und Wartung.

In dem Verband sind viele Stadtnetzbetreiber organisiert, größte Mitglieder sind die Netzbetreiber Ewe Tel, 1&1 Versatel und Deutsche Glasfaser. Die drei großen Stadtnetzbetreiber M-Net (München), Netcologne (Köln) und Wilhelm.tel sind nicht im Breko, sondern im Buglas (Bundesverband Glasfaseranschluss) engagiert.

LOVE Island’s Adam Collard had people reaching for their calculators last night after revealing he'd had sex with 200 women - despite being only 22.

But Benny London, 24, from Croydon, South London, scoffs at Adam’s paltry numbers because the self-confessed ‘crazy geezer’ has beaten that figure – having done the dirty with 250 ladies. And, yes, he DID get his end away last night. Here, he tells us all about the (many) notches on his bedpost...

9 Benny London, 24, claims girls are attracted to him because of his hilarious 'banter'

I’ve probably had sex with between 250 and 300 women.

I had sex for the first time when I was 16 and I didn’t last long! I’d just left school and it was with my childhood sweetheart in the bedroom of her parents’ home.

I don’t want to talk too much about it though because she broke my heart, in fact, I think it’s because of what happened with her that I’m the way I am now.

I thought I was in love at the time and she cheated on me.

9 Benny, pictured on a night out with pals, lost his virginity to his childhood sweetheart at 16

Former Love Island favourite Dom Lever pours scorn on current star Adam Collard's claim that he's slept with 200 women

Now I find it really hard to trust someone. So, if I’m just sleeping with someone I’m not getting my heart broken.

I have sex at the moment about three or four times a week – the last time was last night with a girl I met at a pub in London.

I went back to her house, we watched Love Island, saw Adam boast about his numbers and had some fun.

I have sex with women I meet when I go out on the town – in clubs and bars.

But I’m not like Adam from Love Island. He’s a good looking geezer – I’m more of a crazy geezer. In fact, I don’t really like him.

ITV 9 Adam, pictured snogging Zara, claimed he had slept with 200 people on last night's Love Island

ITV 9 Love Island viewers were surprised by hunky personal trainer Adam's claims

He manipulates women, looking at them like they are a piece of meat. But I am not like that.

I am funny, I’m a div and I’ve always got on with girls.

The only six pack I’ve got is a six pack of beer.

Adam may have the looks but I have the personality and banter. But as I always say: funny gets honey.

I don’t just chat women up; it’s my dance moves that wins them over. I create a buzz on the dance floor.

I used to be a bit of a div, but now I am a really nice gentleman.

9 'Crazy geezer' Benny says being funny helps him 'bag a honey'

If I like a woman I’ll sidle over and ask her for a kiss or if she wants a drink.

I’ll chat to her for a bit and then ask her if she wants to come home with me.

She’ll come to mine, or I’ll go to hers, or we might go to a hotel.

If I like her I will see her again.

But I think that girls are worse than guys for not seeing you again. It didn’t used to be that way, but now they all just want one thing.

My special move is the ‘tongue tornado’ Benny London

They go out, they know what they want and they don’t contact you again. If I like a girl I will always contact her again.

But I don’t like girls making the first move; I get a bit shy when they do that.

I started having sex a lot in 2014 when I started doing loads on social media. Girls started tweeting me and I got a big buzz from it.

9 Benny London started 'having a lot of sex' in 2014 when his online profile rose

9 Benny says Love Island's Adam is good-looking - but that he's funnier and has better banter

They started sliding into my DMs, sending my racy pictures, and I suddenly started getting hit up to do parties.

I turned ‘Benny Ldn’, my Twitter name, into a brand. Now people see me in clubs and approach me.

I’ve had sex with five girls in a week and three girls in a night, so I've had a foursome. It was really good.

The foursome happened when I was 22. I came back with a few girls after a party and we were all cracking onto each other. I was surprised, I am a normal guy but I took my chance and they took the bait.

9 Benny enjoys a boozy night out with pals

The five times in a week was when I was 18.

The girls ended up coming every day in a row. It was a bit naughty, that.

I work from home, so I have had a lot of free time to go out and have sex.

But I always use protection and have STI checks. I have never had an STI as a result.

I’m 24 now and I think I’ve calmed down a bit. My last long-term relationship ended in January.

We went out for seven months but things ended suddenly when she said I dumped her to go on Love Island, but obviously I didn’t because I am not on it.

9 Benny says he's curbed his wild ways since getting a bit older

I would never want to lead a girl on just to have sex with her. I’m always upfront and honest with women.

I haven’t had an actual long-term relationship, apart from the one that ended earlier this year over the Love Island misunderstanding.

I just haven’t been able to settle down and I haven’t met the right type of girls.

Previously I’ve dated glamour models but now I want a nice, normal girl with a lovely personality who makes me laugh.

The most important thing to me is banter. And it is really important to me girls are turned on, I love going down on women and making them happy. I find that a turn on.

ORLEANS — Great white shark researchers are turning their attention to Cape Cod Bay.

The Cape Cod Times reports Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist, and his team will once again track and tag the sharks off the famous tourist destination this summer. But rather than just monitoring the predators in the Atlantic Ocean, they’ll also bring their research vessels and spotter planes into the bayside of the peninsula.

Skomal tells the newspaper increased sightings of juvenile white sharks in bay waters convinced the scientists to expand their study area.

Fishermen have reported sharks snatching striped bass and other fish from their lines. The sharks reportedly range from 8 to 12 feet in length.

Cape Cod had two shark attacks last summer, including the state’s first fatal human attack in 80 years.

DENVER -- The FBI's Denver office and local law enforcement are searching for a woman who allegedly made threats against schools in the Denver metro area Tuesday.

According to the FBI, Sol Pais is infatuated with the Columbine massacre and purchased a gun in the Denver area.

At a news conference Tuesday night, authorities revealed new details about the search.

According to Dean Phillips, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Denver, the Miami FBI office alerted the Denver office about the threat of Pais.

Phillips said Pais flew to Denver on Monday night. She then bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition in the Denver area and went to the foothills of Jefferson County.

Those actions promoted the FBI to consider Pais a credible threat.

Phillips said the FBI is working with law enforcement throughout the metro area and it is tracking a significant number of leads.

"This has become a massive manhunt," Phillips said.

Pais is considered armed and extremely dangerous.

Voter records show Pais is from Surfside, Florida, in the Miami area.

Authorities described Pais as a white female who is 18 years old. She is about 5-foot-5. She was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots.

Anyone who sees Pais or knows where she might be is asked to contact the FBI tipline at 303-630-6227. Tips can also be sent by email.

Officials urged the public not to approach Pais.

About 2:45 p.m. Tuesday, the Colorado Department of Education recommended all Denver-area schools conduct a lockout and controlled release of students because of the threats.

Sol Pais is armed and dangerous. We are operating out of an abundance of caution. The threat is not isolated to one school or individual. Federal, state, and local law enforcement are working together to keep our community safe. Tip Line: 303-630-6227.

MyKayla Skinner reacts after finishing her floor exercise at the NCAA gymnastics championship on April 21, 2018, at the Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis. Richard Ulreich/Zuma Press/Cal Sport Media via AP Images

At an NCAA regional gymnastics competition earlier this month, University of Utah junior MyKayla Skinner did the unthinkable: She fell on the uneven bars. It’s true that falls are pretty standard in gymnastics (Stick It wouldn’t lie to you), but Skinner simply does not fall in competition. This was the first miss of her NCAA career, ending a 161-routine hit streak, the longest in collegiate history. (The fall occurs at 48:30, when she misses her big release move.)

The rest of Skinner’s routine was nearly perfect, but it didn’t matter. After she landed her dismount, she quickly saluted and rejoined her team, her face inscrutable but clearly lacking the post-routine jubilation for which NCAA gymnastics is famous. Her reaction was remarkably stoic, given the fall’s significance —but MyKayla Skinner was not about to let the haters see her cry.

For though Skinner can always count on the notoriously hardcore fans of the Red Rocks (the Ute gym squad has its own nickname), outside of Utah, her reception is markedly less warm. And this isn’t because she’s not good—in fact, she’s great. Her difficulty and consistency are unmatched in the NCAA, but even when she doesn’t fall, her scoring often comes up short of perfection. She’s routinely shown up by rivals such as UCLA’s Kyla Ross, who compete with a much lower level of difficulty. Ross—known for her elegance and technique—is widely considered the favorite for the individual all-around title at this year’s national championships, which start Friday. This, unsurprisingly, infuriates Utah’s rabid booster base and delights the many, many, many pourers of MyKayla Skinner haterade, collegiate gymnastics’ unofficial beverage of choice.

Indeed, Skinner, despite being by many metrics the best college gymnast in the country, might just be the most reviled gymnast in the NCAA—and I, for one, think people should give her a damn break.

So what’s the deal? Why is MyKayla Skinner so controversial? In a word: attitude. Despite being an outstanding gymnast—her opening tumbling pass on floor is a double-double, which most international elites can’t throw—Skinner lacks one key quality that all champion gymnasts must possess: the constant smile required even of athletes being carried off the floor. Yes, in the post–Larry Nassar world of U.S. gymnastics, at both the elite and collegiate levels, gymnasts are now “allowed” to do all sorts of things they once couldn’t: eat, date, speak up for themselves in certain highly regulated situations. But one thing still remains strictly verboten in gym world: a so-called bad attitude. And Skinner is as famous for hers as she is for that double-double.

Take, for example, her widely-shared reaction to the 9.925 she received after a hit floor routine during the same meet that viral UCLA star Katelyn Ohashi got the same score with a lacking first-pass landing:

Skinner lunges at the judges with a venomous WTF look and only steps off when a coach hugs her away. (It is strictly forbidden for athletes to interact with judges in any way outside of the official presentation lineup before an event.)

Then there was the scandalette of 2018, when an improvised salute to teammates in her floor choreography was immediately interpreted as “finger guns” at a rival squad. Or more recently, the time she tweeted: “So far this season I’ve stuck 5 [Yurchenko] double fulls without both judges giving me a 10. Stay tuned for our meet vs UCLA on Saturday and see if we can make it 6!!”

And it’s not just in the moments of slight that Skinner’s alleged ’tude eclipses her skills: When she’s on, she is perceived as cocky, lip-syncing along midroutine with the Carrie Underwood song that works as her unofficial “beam music,” or engaging in an even more outré version of a touchdown dance, pumping her fists and crying out in what appears, to haters, to be aggression rather than shiny, nonthreatening joy. Television commentators, those masters of euphemism, call her “fiercely competitive.”

Skinner first gained international fame as an elite in 2016 when she had a spectacular showing at the Olympic Trials but ended up going to Rio as an alternate thanks to some behind-the-scenes calculation. In her grief, and being a prolific social-media teen, Skinner retweeted some unsavory responses to her slight —including a doctored photo that showed her face on the body of two-time gold medalist Gabby Douglas and included a racist series of emojis. (Skinner later apologized and seemed genuinely contrite, if inarticulate, in that contrition.)

Though the retweet was a legitimately problematic act for which Skinner shouldn’t get a pass, it was the sour grapes themselves that cemented her villain edit in the gymnastics world. Oh, MyKayla Skinner—good gymnastics, but what a terrible attitude! And despite the stratospheric level of her gymnastics, her villain image has only grown in the NCAA to the point it’s affecting her results.

It is, for example, widely assumed that her comportment is the reason Skinner is continually passed up for conferencewide awards, and why she more often than not misses out on that coveted 10 despite 161 hit routines and almost as many stuck landings. Haters will claim her feet are flexed or her chest is slightly too low or another “obvious” form deduction, but NCAA judging is famously, woefully subjective, and—as any Utah fan will remind you—that 10 is an honor bestowed quite often upon Skinner’s joyful colleagues in blue, despite their share of flexed feet and the like. Yes, it’s worth remembering that the NCAA is not elite competition. Execution (allegedly) matters more than difficulty, and as long as athletes have the minimum skills required for a 10.0 “start value,” that dime is within their reach, double-double or no. And Skinner certainly knows this—but still, it must be pretty frustrating to (probably) lose the national title to an athlete with a fraction of the difficulty.

In so many other sports, attitude is often viewed as competitiveness. This is especially the case in men’s sports. As the Gymternet’s Lauren Hopkins has pointed out, “plenty of male athletes” get salty with few of the consequences, and Skinner’s sportsmanship transgressions are comparatively tame. But there is something particular to the “beauty sports” (gymnastics, figure skating, etc.) that requires an inerrantly sweet disposition—one that matches the pageant hair and makeup from the neck up, and not the grueling training and grit required for everything neck-down. (Remember when Skinner’s alleged 2016 usurper Douglas also got the villain edit, and the nickname “Crabby Gabby,” for not being sufficiently beatific on the medal stand?) Skinner is not doing anything that generations of athletes haven’t done before her—but because she’s doing it in rhinestones and an updo, suddenly it matters.

Much has been said in recent years, and deservedly so, about the toxicity that accompanied American gymnastics’ rise to worldwide dominance. The running narrative this season has been about how many athletes—Ohashi most prominently—have been able to find joy in the NCAA after withstanding the trauma of the elite world. Ohashi got mega-famous because her floor routine’s ebullient pop moves were, to the greater viewing public, subversive. But they were subversive with a megawatt smile, and that continues to be the only kind of subversion that’s allowed.

Will there ever be room for the gymnasts who find their true joy in, you know, winning? Who dare to care when they don’t win? Who refuse to be sweet little bundles of delight? I’ll believe that the NCAA is the widely touted panacea to USA Gymnastics’ toxicity when its culture embraces the greatness of MyKayla Skinner—attitude and all.
GE Research, the R&D wing of American conglomerate GE, has used 3D printing to design an ultra-efficient, low-emission heat exchanger for power generation equipment. Called UPHEAT (Ultra Performance Heat Exchanger enabled by Additive Technology), the heat exchanger is part of a $2.5 M project led by GE Research.

The project was established through the Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (ARPA-E) High Intensity Thermal Exchange through Materials and Manufacturing Processes program (HITEMMP). In it, GE Research collaborated with University of Maryland (UMD) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

Over the course of two years, the collaborators aim to “develop a high temperature, high pressure and super-compact heat exchanger that would enable cleaner, more efficient power generation in both existing and next generation power plant platforms” using 3D printing.

“We’re taking our deep knowledge in metals and thermal management and applying it in ways we couldn’t have before through the power of 3D printing,” commented Peter deBock, a Principal Thermal Engineer for GE Research and project leader on the ARPA-E award.

“With 3D printing, we can now achieve new design architectures previously not possible. And this will allow us to create an ‘UPHEAT’ device that can operate cost effectively at temperatures 250°C (450°F) degrees higher than today’s heat exchangers.”

A heat exchanger that takes the breath away

Heat exchangers are widely used in a multitude of applications like space heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Specifically, GE Research is focusing on application in power generation equipment like gas turbines. Comparing its purpose to functions inside the human body, deBock says, “Lungs are the ultimate heat exchanger, circulating the air you breathe to keep the body functioning at peak performance while also regulating your body’s temperature. Heat exchangers in power generation equipment like a gas turbine essentially perform the same function, but at much higher temperatures and pressures.”

The UPHEAT heat exchanger is made from a nickel superalloy designed by GE Research specifically for additive manufacturing. The material is capable of withstanding high temperatures and is crack-resistant. ORNL, a specialist in corrosion science, will test and validate the long term performance of the materials used.

Upon completion, the heat exchanger is expected to provide increased thermal efficiency of indirect heated power cycles, with reduced energy consumption and emissions. It will be capable of operating at temperatures up to 1,652 °F (900°C) and pressures up to 3626 psi (250 bar). With these properties, the UPHEAT could enable advanced applications in power and aerospace towards more energy efficient processes.

deBock adds that: “With additive manufacturing, GE and University of Maryland will now explore more intricate biological shapes and designs to enable a step change in heat exchanger performance that delivers higher efficiency and lower emissions.”

Advanced metal additive manufacturing with GE Research

GE Research, formerly known as GE Global Research, is currently part of a project funded by national 3D printing development partner America Makes to develop a commercial-grade, metal additive manufacturing system in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Funded by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the project is part of the Acceleration of Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing (ALSAM) scheme from America Makes.

The research and development division has also developed a process for creating 1:1 scale twin digital models of metal 3D printed parts for the U.S. Navy. Through the digital twinning process, the Navy will depend on GE to accelerate the production of mission-critical equipment.

“Using GE’s Digital Twin technology, we’re aiming to rapidly speed up the time that parts could be re-engineered or newly created using 3D printing processes,” said Ade Makinde, Principal Engineer of Additive Technologies at GE Global Research.

GE Additive has been nominated for the third annual 3D Printing Industry Awards in the OEM of the year (Enterprise) category. You can cast your vote and help decide this year’s winners now.

Links to cancer shown in US federal draft report on glyphosate

Report that alleged Monsanto collaborator at the EPA tried to "kill" is finally published

A draft US federal report has confirmed links between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup weedkiller, and some forms of cancer. The report could have a damaging impact on Bayer/Monsanto’s attempt to defend the large number of legal cases involving its weedkiller.



On April 8, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), which is tied to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, released its long-awaited draft toxicological report on glyphosate. It had been delayed for over three years, allegedly thanks to the efforts of Monsanto and a group of high-ranking officials within the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



The ATSDR documented a range of concerns about glyphosate. But most worryingly for Bayer/Monsanto, just like the World Health Organisation's cancer agency IARC, it identified evidence for a link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This is exactly the outcome that the company feared because it undercuts its narrative that IARC’s concerns about glyphosate’s carcinogenicity can be offset by the EPA’s determination that glyphosate is “not likely” to cause cancer.



According to the cautiously worded ATSDR report, “Numerous studies reported risk ratios greater than 1 for associations between glyphosate exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or multiple myeloma; however, the reported associations were statistically significant only in a few studies."



"Greater than 1" simply means that there is an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for people exposed to glyphosate herbicides. And the fact that the association were statistically significant in "only a few" studies still means there are several studies that do find an association.

The ATSDR disagrees with the EPA on glyphosate's carcinogenicity

Dr Chuck Benbrook, a former director of the National Academy of Sciences' Board on Agriculture and an expert on glyphosate use, told Agri-Pulse that although ATSDR is “extremely cautious” and “does a good job dancing around” the carcinogenicity question, ultimately it does NOT agree with EPA’s determination that glyphosate is “not likely” to cause cancer — “they [ATSDR] certainly did not support EPA’s final evaluation”.



Tina Levine, a former manager in EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs, where she ran the Health Effects Division, told Bloomberg, “There does seem to be an effect. It’s not a large risk [for NHL] but it’s there based on what ATSDR has found."



Unfortunately the ATSDR did not consider the industry mouse studies that showed malignant lymphoma in glyphosate-exposed animals. Now, after the EU Court of Justice verdict giving access to documents, all these studies should be available for the ATSDR.



Contrary to Germany's BfR and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the ATSDR also recognized some evidence for genotoxicity of the active ingredient glyphosate.



The ATSDR glyphosate report is open for public consultation now (deadline is July 8).

Report that Monsanto's alleged mole at the EPA tried to "kill"

The ATSDR report could have a major impact in the US as well as Europe. According to Bloomberg, this is the study that Monsanto's alleged mole at the EPA, Jess Rowland, said in April 2015 he aimed to "kill".



The report was meant to have been published by the end of 2015 – but it wasn't.



According to an article by US Right to Know's Carey Gillam, documents released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests reveal that the delay "was no accident, no bureaucratic delay, but rather was the result of a collaborative effort between Monsanto and a group of high-ranking EPA officials".



Gillam writes, "For Monsanto, the timing of the ATSDR review was worrisome. In March 2015, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) had declared glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen, and Monsanto feared ATSDR might have similar concerns about the chemical."



The stalemate was broken when last week, according to Bloomberg, the House Science Committee sent a letter to ATSDR director Patrick Breysse, asking about the status of the draft report.



Now, three years later and with thousands of lawsuits against Monsanto/Bayer waiting to be heard, the report has finally seen the light of day. And it's likely to add to the company's woes.

Realistic studies would have shown greater risks

Environmental groups have questioned regulatory approvals of glyphosate, arguing that they often do not reflect real-life exposure scenarios.



Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, “The risks would’ve been found to be greater had they given sufficient weight to more realistic studies of people and test animals exposed to the full product, not just one chemical in Roundup."



Sass also pointed out that the ATSDR report raises the issue of endocrine, reproductive, and developmental concerns “that are not being addressed in some of the high-profile litigation that’s grabbing headlines”.

Further research needed

The ATSDR made a number of recommendations for further research:



* Studies should be designed to evaluate respiratory effects in animals exposed to glyphosate by inhalation.

* Additional studies should be designed to determine whether glyphosate or other ingredients in glyphosate formulations are involved in developmental effects on male reproductive organs.

* Human and animal studies should be designed to evaluate airborne exposure levels and possible health effects from inhalation exposure. Additional animal studies should be designed to assess the toxic effects of exposure to a variety of glyphosate formulations and individual components suspected to be toxic.

* Studies are needed to investigate human intake of glyphosate via food and water, such as total diet studies.

* Monitoring of children’s exposure to glyphosate would be useful, in combination with children’s health and susceptibility information, to assess the potential risk for harmful effects.

The Freedom From Religion Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky have filed for summary judgment in a federal lawsuit over an atheist being denied an irreverent license plate in Kentucky.

FFRF and the ACLU sued the Kentucky transportation secretary in November 2016 on behalf of a Kentucky citizen, Bennie Hart, who was refused a personalized license plate reading “IM GOD.” U.S. District Court Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove last year allowed the case to move forward.

Kentucky DMV officials first refused Hart’s request in early 2016, calling his license plate message “obscene or vulgar.” Later, the state said the plate was rejected because it was “not in good taste.” The lawsuit challenges the denial of plates based on such vague notions. It also contests viewpoint or content-based restrictions on personalized plates.

The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that while the government may choose its own message, the free speech clause applies to private speech, as the latest motion, filed on Monday, April 15, asserts. It is of little significance that the state prints the plate. Private speech is routinely permitted on government property. Kentucky’s plate restriction on the basis that an individual seeks to promote “any specific faith, religion, or antireligion” is accordingly unconstitutional, FFRF and the ACLU maintain.

Furthermore, “not only is Kentucky’s application of the statutes unconstitutional on its face, it is impermissibly viewpoint-discriminatory and unreasonable as applied to Mr. Hart’s plate request,” the motion contends. So, plates with the phrases “SRVGOD” and “THXGOD” have been approved, while “IM GOD” was denied.

The First Amendment prohibits the Kentucky government from selectively rejecting certain religious or nonreligious messages, and its pattern of allowing certain religious messages demonstrates that its decision to reject Hart’s plate is based on his specific viewpoint. Hart maintained a license plate with the same text requested here, “IM GOD,” for 12 years in Ohio without any issues.

“This is a clear denial of free speech on capricious and random grounds,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “Kentucky officials can’t suppress freethinking perspectives while permitting religious statements.”

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is a national state/church organization with more than 31,000 nonreligious members and several chapters all over the country, including hundreds of members and a chapter in Kentucky.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Kentucky is freedom's watchdog, working daily in the courts, legislatures and communities to defend individual rights and personal freedoms.
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. trade deficit fell for the second straight month in February, and the politically sensitive deficit in the trade of goods with China narrowed.

The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the gap between the goods and services that the United States sells and what it buys from the rest of the world dropped 3.4% to $49.4 billion in February, the lowest since June. The deficit had slid 14.6% in January. Exports climbed 1.1% to $209.7 billion on a surge in shipments of civilian aircraft, passenger cars and medicine. Imports rose 0.2% to $259.1 billion.

The goods deficit with China dropped 28.2% to $24.8 billion: Exports to China rose 18.2% to $8.4 billion while imports from China fell 20.2% to $33.2 billion.

President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports in a fight over U.S. allegations that China steals U.S. technology and forces foreign firms to turn over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. China has retaliated by targeting $110 billion worth of American products.

Trump campaigned on a pledge to reduce America’s longstanding trade deficit with the rest of the world. He sees the gap as a sign of economic weakness and as the result of bad trade deals and abusive practices by America’s trading partners.

In addition to targeting Chinese products, Trump has slapped tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, dishwashers and solar panels. And he is threatening to tax imported cars, too.

In fact, the threat of U.S. auto tariffs - and retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners - may have boosted American auto exports and improved the trade balance in February. “Automakers may have been trying to rush U.S.-made units to their destinations just in case the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported vehicles … and set off a tit-for-tat motor vehicle trade war,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a research note.

A narrowing trade deficit adds to America’s gross domestic product - the broadest measure of economic output. So after the trade numbers came out, economists were upgrading the outlook for U.S. economic growth. Stanley said he was likely to push his forecast for the first quarter above an annual rate of 2%, up from the 1.7% he’d penciled in before Commerce released the trade numbers.

Mainstream economists view trade deficits as the result of an economic reality unlikely to yield to changes in trade policy: Americans buy more than they produce, and imports fill the gap. The strong U.S. economy also encourages Americans to buy more foreign products.

U.S. exports are also hurt by the American dollar’s role as the world’s currency. The dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions. That means the dollar is persistently strong, raising prices of U.S. products and putting American companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets.

The U.S. has been much more competitive in the trade of services such as banking and education than in the trade of goods such as appliances and clothing. In February, U.S. services exports hit a record $70.1 billion, producing a services surplus of $22.6 billion. But America ran $72 billion deficit in goods.

The late, great John Alvin was one of the most accomplished movie poster artists of all time. He created the iconic posters for movies like Blade Runner, Gremlins, The Goonies, The Little Mermaid, Batman Returns, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King, just to name a few. But he also created the poster for one of the most successful movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. And a new version of this classic poster will soon become available to fans everywhere.

Poster print Justin Ishmael and the good folks ISH, Bottleneck Gallery and Vice Press have joined with Andrea Alvin and the John Alvin Estate for a new series of posters celebrating Alvin's legendary work. Each poster in the new John Alvin series will be sourced from original art and files from John's archive. It will be approved not only by the studio, but by John wife, Andrea Alvin, with a signed and embossed certificate. These are not only classic posters from John's career but also unreleased finished works for some of your favorite films that have rarely or never been seen before.



And the first poster available will be Alvin's most famous one. The classic original E.T theatrical poster image was painted by John using very little reference from the actual film as the studio wanted to keep E.T. hidden prior to the film's release. John was taken to the studio and shown a floppy hand that looked like a rubber chicken and then expected to create something to sell the film. He went to work and used his daughter for the human hand reference on the poster and actually created the E.T. logo we all know by hand cutting the "E.T." out of cardboard and painting it onto the actual art with an airbrush to achieve the glow.

Andrea Alvin said in a statement: "John was often asked, 'Of all the posters you created, which was your favorite?' He would usually answer E.T. because of the movie's great success. It was also 'the big one that didn't get away.' His work was on everything from keychains to bed sheets. IT WAS CRAZY!"

The regular print is a 24 x 36 inches, 9 color screen print, and will set you back $75. It comes with a numbered Certificate of Authenticity embossed by the Alvin Estate. The limited edition is also a 24 x 36 inches 9 color screen print on foil, and this numbered edition of 225 comes in at $100. It also comes with a numbered COA embossed by Andrea

The sale will start on Thursday, April 18 at 12pm eastern and last till Monday, April 22 at 12pm eastern. The edition will be determined once the sale ends. The print will be available at Bottleneck Gallery and Vice Press.

Tracking The Money Race Behind The Presidential Campaign

Raising money isn't just a necessity for candidates hoping to make it through the long and expensive presidential primary process — it's a way to measure candidates' credibility and staying power in a crowded field.

Democrats are dealing with their largest primary pool in at least 40 years, and how they fare in raking in cash could separate the candidates in the pack.

Here are the financial figures that the candidates, including President Trump, have reported to the Federal Election Commission, so far.

These numbers reflect the total amount raised for the first quarter of 2019. This includes, among other sources, money raised from individual contributions and money transferred from other campaign accounts, such as a candidate's past Senate or House campaign:

There are also more detailed fundraising metrics that give the public an idea about the priorities of the candidates and how they run their campaigns.

Democrats have widely rejected, for example, support from corporate political action committees. While these committees have allowed businesses and trade groups in the past to funnel huge amounts of cash to eager candidates, Democrats have become increasingly worried about the appearance of businesses having undue influence over the political process.

Campaigns are also making a point of touting the amount they have raised from small donors (those who give less than $200). These donors, who don't have to disclose their names or information, can represent the measure of a candidate's grassroots support. That, of course, doesn't always translate to primary delegates — as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders learned during his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2016 — but it certainly gives candidates staying power.

Loading...

Candidates are required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission through 2019 and then will switch to monthly reports if they've raised or spent at least $100,000.

Total money raised for each candidate includes the following:

Individual contributions: Donations from individuals — capped at $2,800 per donor for the primaries. This is the top-line number campaigns often advertise and is broken down into supporters who have given more than $200 and those who have given $200 or less.

The club is celebrating its birthday with a 14-hour rave in event hall Palais 12. In the run-up to the party, the club will also play a specially created playlist in the STIB stations.



From 10 o'clock in the morning, a playlist featuring 12 Fusion Classics will play through the speakers of all 69 STIB metro stations. The long list was drawn up by regular Fuse goers and the club itself picked a top 12 to play.



"Together with STIB we actually will organize the largest underground rave in the world," said Nick Wessaert from Fuse. "The songs are true classics, that way it will remain fun for commuters who never set foot in the Fuse as well," he added.



The Fuse playlist will be on repeat in the metro stations until midnight. After that, the music stops. "We expect that everyone will gradually descend towards Palais 12, which makes our list the ideal shuttle music for our partygoers," said Wessaert.

× Man receives prison sentence for shooting at fireflies he thought were ‘alien lasers’

LAMAR TOWNSHIP, Pa. — A man who fired shots at what he thought were “alien lasers” is headed to prison.

Troopers said Jesse Shields, of Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, was high on bath salts last June when he fired a handgun into the sky near Mill Hall.

The “alien lasers” he shot at were actually fireflies.

Fearing they were being chased, Shields and a woman, Katherine McCloskey, ran to a nearby home where the homeowner got the gun from them and called 911.

Shields then allegedly asked the homeowner if he could take a shower to “get the goo off him that was burning his skin.”

Shields was sentenced Monday to three to six years in prison after pleading guilty last month to criminal trespass and firearms without a license.

McCloskey pleaded guilty in November to DUI, operating a vehicle while under the influence of a controlled substance and disorderly conduct. She was sentenced to six days to six months in jail.
More than 100 people were arrested on Wednesday in the climate protests that have caused major disruption in central London, Scotland Yard said, taking the total number of arrests to almost 400.

Activists stepped up the demonstrations on their third day, targeting the capital’s rail network and the home of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.

Traders in the West End warned that the protests, which have seen protesters block four London landmarks for the past three days, had already cost them tens of millions of pounds.

More than 300 arrested at Extinction Rebellion protests in London Read more

The first estimate of the financial impact of the so-called climate rebellion came as activists targeted London’s rail network. Just after 11am, three people glued themselves to a train at Canary Wharf station, causing delays on the Docklands Light Railway.

A few hours later, four protesters glued their hands together and chained themselves to a fence outside Corbyn’s house, saying he was “the best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis, adding that they were there to “support him” to go further.

Thousands of people, including parents and young children, pensioners, scientists and environmentalists, have taken part in Extinction Rebellion protests.

On Wednesday afternoon, the four sites that protesters had occupied in London since Monday – Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus – remained under their control, causing ongoing delays and diversions in the surrounding areas.

The Metropolitan police has designated Marble Arch as a legitimate protest site. By early evening, large numbers of police officers had turned out in force at the other three sites announcing they were imposing a section 14 order requiring protesters to leave.

Several hundred officers appeared in Parliament Square, removed sparsely manned roadblocks and took down gazebos, apparently retaking the space without difficulty. However, there were reports that activists had managed to hold the space after the arrival of a samba band, while others tried to set up new barriers around the square.

In Oxford Circus, police circulated among the crowd, who had been dancing all day to music from a stage mounted on a pink boat, serving notice on each.

Police made a concerted attempt to clear Waterloo Bridge by walking among the crowd and serving section 14 notices on all the people assembled there, telling them they had the right to either to go home or continue their protest in Marble Arch. Anyone who refused to comply was arrested.

By 9pm the Guardian had witnessed police carry away at least a dozen protesters, while many others left of their own accord. People who had already been served notice were arrested straight away if they did not leave after a few minutes.

There was pandemonium at times as police officers walked through the crowd, picking individuals apparently at random. A large number of police officers arrived as reinforcements at about 8.30pm.

However, numbers of protesters remained strong and cheers erupted each time an arrest was made. By 9.15pm they were led in a call and response song and chants of “whose police? our police. Whose hearts? Our hearts. Whose souls? Our souls.”

On Tuesday, organisers had warned that they were planning to disrupt London’s rail and tube network, and just after 11am three activists glued themselves to a DLR train at Canary Wharf, unfurling a banner reading, “Climate emergency – act now.” Two people then glued themselves to the top of the train. Another man, who gave his name as Mark, glued himself to the side of the train. The protesters were finally removed from the roof by police at 12.40pm.

Cathy Eastburn, 51, was one of those taking part in the transport disruption. She said she decided to make a stand for her teenage daughters. “I don’t want to be here today and I’m really sorry for the disruption, but I feel I have been forced to do this,” she said. “I have two daughters and I can’t sit by while their future is threatened … The government is doing nothing – we have to force them to act.”

Gail Bradbrook, one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, who was at the scene, said: “This [Canary Wharf] is the heart of the system that is bringing us to our knees causing huge disruption and chaos around the world … so we want people to pause and reflect.”

A few hours later another group of activists glued themselves together, then chained themselves to the fence of Corbyn’s house. The Labour leader left his home a few hours later saying he never gave interviews, or arranged meetings, outside his house. The activists left shortly after, saying Labour had offered to meet Extinction Rebellion next week.

David Lambert, 60, was one of those taking part. “We are here because we are supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and he is the best hope this country has got to get us out of this,” he said. “But we need system change and a transformation of our consumer economy and we know he is a person who has the authority and power to deliver that.”

The events in London are part of an international “climate rebellion” organised by the UK-based Extinction Rebellion. Protests had taken place or were planned in 80 cities across 33 countries, from India to Australia, and around Europe and the US. In The Hague , activists occupied the international criminal court building on Tuesday.

Twenty-nine arrests were made in Edinburgh on Tuesday night after police cleared remaining activists who who staged a sit-in on North Bridge. By 6am on Wednesday, they had all had been released and charged with breach of the peace, to appear in court at a later date.

In London, Extinction Rebellion protesters, activists and legal observers said some of those arrested were being taken to police stations outside of London, lending credence to persistent rumours that the Metropolitan police’s holding cells were reaching capacity. Several people reported cases of people being taken to Luton, Brighton and Essex. The Met would not confirm or deny the claim.

On Wednesday, Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of New West End Company which represents Oxford Street and central London retailers, told Sky News the protests were hitting business hard.

“We have seen a 25% drop in spend – it was £12m yesterday and obviously we have had disruption today. The impact is customers thinking they are not going to come up over the bank holiday so this could go into the hundreds of millions of pounds if we do not grip this.”

Venezolanos son los que más dificultades tienen para ingresar a Chile. Durante el año 2018, más de 13 mil extranjeros no pudieron ingresar al país. Dicha cifra, constituye una de las más altas de los últimos 5 años.

Venezolanos en Chile

El mayor porcentaje de personas que no pueden ingresar a Chile son venezolanos, constituyendo un 48,7% del total.

A 76.317 personas ha llegado la cifra de extranjeros que, en estos cinco años, no han podido ingresar a través del Área de Migraciones y Policía Internacional de la Policía de Investigaciones, entre los que también se encuentran colombianos, peruanos, haitianos y ecuatorianos.

Más del 67% de estos rechazos tienen que ver con no acreditar como corresponde la calidad de turista, es decir, no cuentan con el dinero para sustentar su estadía por 3 meses.

El subprefecto de la PDI, Claudio Soto, expresó que existe una cifra diaria que serían un poco más de 39.000 pesos, los que debieran ser acreditados para poder hacer ingreso al país. El monto sería una estadística del Sernatur y es más o menos lo que se podría gastar a diario en el país.

La organización policial indicó que estas medidas se ajustan a la ley y que se han tratado de apegar a ellas, tanto en el gobierno de Michelle Bachelet como en el actual. Además explicaron que las bajas de rechazos en el Aeropuerto de Chacalluta, en Arica, en los años 2015 y 2016, no tiene ninguna relación con presiones desde organizaciones como derechos humanos.

Ley de migraciones

La masiva llegada de colombianos, peruanos, y más venezolanos y haitianos en el último tiempo, han levantado la necesidad de una nueva ley de migraciones para regular la llegada de extranjeros al país.

Hace un tiempo, Arturo Subercaseaux -egresado de Derecho UDP y militante Evópoli- hizo un análisis en Twitter al respecto al sostener que “nuestra Ley de Migraciones es la más antigua de América Latina” que data desde 1975, que “permite que una persona ingrese legalmente como turista, por un plazo de 90 días, y que durante su estadía solicite autorización para trabajar e incluso solicitar visación de ‘residente sujeto a contrato (de trabajo)’”, y también sobre el número real de haitianos en el país: En el periodo 2016-2017 ingresaron 153 mil habitantes de Haití y 250 mil de Venezuela.

Agregó que “el control de la visa de turista es muy bajo” por la cantidad de cosas que permite. Además de urgir por un cambio en la ley, explicó que un sistema de inspiración internacional de inmigración es el canadiense que se sostiene por puntos: “Son seis factores: edad, idioma, empleos requeridos en el territorio, redes de contacto en el mismo Estado”, especificó.




The unique genetic heritage of the Finns — marked by repeated population bottlenecks and isolation from their neighbors in northern Europe — is helping scientists embark on a search for the complex links between genes and diseases.

Finland also has a robust network of biobanks, and the country has passed laws that make the voluminous biobank data accessible to researchers. The combination of those two factors has set the stage for the FinnGen study, which began in the fall of 2017 and will continue for six years. FinnGen is a consortium being coordinated by the University of Helsinki in which Pfizer and six other pharmaceutical partners will work with Finnish biobanks to conduct genomic and phenotype analysis involving up to 500,000 patients.

Key to this study is that the Finns underwent repeated population bottlenecks (severe and rapid reductions in population size) — including major episodes about 4,000 years ago and again 2,000 years ago. In addition, the Finns were relatively isolated, making the country’s population of 5.5 million today relatively homogeneous genetically. These features make the Finns well suited to gene mapping studies. In such a population, a genetic mutation in one of the population’s “founders” — that is, the small group of ancestors who survived the bottlenecks — can be more easily tracked.

“In both the demographics and the migration history of the population, there are some unique characteristics in how that presents itself in genetics,” says Melissa R. Miller, Senior Manager, Computational Target Validation, Target Sciences and Technologies at Pfizer and one of the Pfizer investigator(s) for the FinnGen study.

A Brief History of the Finnish People

The area that is Finland today was first inhabited by humans after the glaciers from the last ice age receded about 10,000 years ago. But it remained sparsely populated until about 2,000 years ago, and even then, it wasn’t until the 1500s that people began migrating from the early settlements in the southwest of the country — mostly along the coast of the Baltic Sea — into the northern and eastern regions, with those migrant populations often forming isolated enclaves of fewer than 50,000 people. In addition, there have been repeated population bottlenecks, the last one in the early 1700s.

It wasn’t until the 1500s that people began migrating from the early settlements in the southwest of Finland – mostly areas bordering the Baltic Sea – into the northern and eastern regions.

Why the Finns’ Heritage Lends Itself to Genetic Studies

The combination of population bottlenecks and isolation, especially in eastern Finland, set the stage for what has come to be known as the Finnish Disease Heritage (FDH) — more than 35 recessive genetic disorders prevalent in Finland but rare elsewhere.

“Genetic variants that were present when Finland was founded tend to become more frequent over time within the Finnish population compared to the frequency in other non-Finnish populations,” Miller explains.

By studying the DNA of people with those variants, scientists can map the genes linked to a particular disorder with high resolution using what is known as linkage disequilibrium analysis, which provides information about a population’s genetic history that may influence future genetic processes, such as natural selection.

“This will be an opportunity to help broaden the spectrum of human biology that drives drug discovery,” Miller says, noting that it could also inform how clinical trials are designed for new medicines. “We hope to create a more holistic understanding of how genes control different aspects of our health and wellbeing.”

This will be an opportunity to help broaden the spectrum of human biology that drives drug discovery. Melissa Miller

Furthermore, Finland has a unique biobank law that links biological data to other national health, demographic, and social databases, and the law also makes this information available to researchers, creating a powerful tool for further scientific studies.

Linking those databases allows researchers to see, for example, at what age a person starts to take a certain medication or how long after the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease a person moves to a long-term care facility. “FinnGen benefits from these large interconnected databases and biobanks,” Miller says. “The hope is that we’ll be able to combine that information in such a way that we will improve our understanding of the trajectory of those diseases and identify factors that contribute to their progression.”

And while the study utilizes the unique genetic heritage of the Finnish population, the results of the study will be relevant to populations all over the world, Miller says.
Dimuth Karunaratne has been appointed Sri Lanka's ODI captain and will lead the team during their campaign in the Men's Cricket World Cup 2019.

The opener last played an ODI in the last edition of the tournament, and has only played 17 ODIs all told. He averages 15.83 with a high score of 60. His overall List A numbers are creditable, with an average 34.34 from 120 games, including six centuries.

The left-hander has made waves in Test cricket in recent times, earning selection in the ICC's Test Team of the Year 2018, and captained Sri Lanka to an historic Test series whitewash in South Africa earlier this year, standing in for Dinesh Chandimal.

Chandimal, Mathews, and Malinga have all captained Sri Lanka's ODI side recently

Sri Lanka's ODI captaincy has exchanged hands frequently in recent months. Their last four series have seen them cycle through three different skippers, with all of Angelo Mathews, Chandimal, and Lasith Malinga having been at the helm at some point.

Karunaratne was fined and reprimanded recently by Sri Lanka Cricket after a drink-driving incident, for which he also had his driving licence suspended. Sri Lanka are yet to announce their World Cup preliminary squad.
O ex-presidente do Peru Alan García morreu nesta manhã depois de ter atirado contra a própria cabeça ao receber ordem de prisão da polícia.

Ele era alvo de um pedido de prisão temporária, por dez dias. O ex-presidente era investigado por supostamente ter recebido propina da construtora Odebrecht, segundo o jornal peruano El Comercio.

García foi levado ao hospital Casimiro Ulloa, mas não resistiu ao ferimento. Mais cedo, a ministra da Saúde peruana, Zulema Tomás, disse que o político havia sofrido três paradas cardíacas e que seu estado de saúde era delicado.

De acordo com o El Comercio, a polícia chegou à casa dele, em Lima, às 6h25 (horário local). Ao ser avisado da prisão, García pediu para falar com seus advogados. Em seguida, os policiais ouviram o disparo, encontraram o ex-presidente ferido e o levaram para o hospital.

García foi presidente da nação entre 1985 e 1990 e novamente de 2006 a 2011. Como outros membros do alto escalão da América do Sul, ele foi envolvido no escândalo da Odebrecht e estava sob investigação por suspeita de recebimento de suborno da gigante de construção brasileira. Ele nega irregularidades.

"Como nenhum documento me menciona e nenhum indício nem evidência me inclui, resta a eles a especulação ou inventar intermediários. Jamais me vendi e está provado.", publicou García no Twitter na manhã de ontem.

Como en ningún documento se me menciona y ningún indicio ni evidencia me alcanza sólo les queda la ESPECULACIÓN o inventar intermediarios. Jamás me vendí y está probado. - Alan García (@AlanGarciaPeru) April 16, 2019

No ano passado, García tentou deixar o Peru e solicitou asilo no Uruguai, mas teve o pedido negado.

Investigações sobre doações de campanha e subornos pagos pela Odebrecht respingaram sobre os últimos quatro presidentes do Peru e paralisaram grandes projetos de infraestrutura. Alejandro Toledo (2001-2006) fugiu para os Estados Unidos e enfrenta um pedido de extradição. Ollanta Humala (2011-2016), preso por um ano, agora responde às acusações em liberdade, mas foi impedido de deixar o país. Já o ex-presidente Pedro Paulo Kuczynski (2016-2018) foi preso na semana passada.

Presidente do Peru lamenta morte

Em seu Twitter, o presidente do Peru, Martín Vizcarra, lamentou a morte de Garcia. "Consternado pela morte do ex-presidente Alan García. Envio minhas condolências a sua família e seus entes queridos".

Consternado por el fallecimiento del ex presidente Alan García. Envío mis condolencias a su familia y seres queridos. - Martín Vizcarra (@MartinVizcarraC) 17 de abril de 2019

The day that Star Wars fans have dreamed of for years is finally here. Coming off a massive weekend at Celebration 2019, more news is breaking surrounding the upcoming projects for Disney's acquired Lucasfilm brand. At long last it's been confirmed by the head honcho herself. Knight of the Old Republic is in the early stages of development by the studio. Long hailed as one of the best Star Wars video games of all time, it looks like they're finally getting some motion started on a live action version of that earlier era in the galaxy far, far away. It seems like this has been on fans' minds for quite some time now and they're finally going to deliver what we've wanted.









#EpisodeIX pic.twitter.com/HCjEhdlRv7 #Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy talked to us about the future of #StarWars – including a Knights of the Old Republic movie and female filmmakers taking the helm, as well as Palpatine’s surprise return in the trailer for @StarWars — MTV NEWS (@MTVNEWS) April 16, 2019
















Ottawa Redblacks head coach Rick Campbell believes the offensive coordinator by committee approach can work.

“It’s conventional to have the coordinator title on someone, that’s obviously more common, but the more important thing is a collaboration between the coaches and that there’s a good synergy working. They’ve been working so well as a cohesive unit I just didn’t want to throw the title on someone just for the sake of having that title being thrown on someone,” Campbell told TSN radio 1200 in Ottawa.

“These are just how the titles work, but they’ll be a clear protocol of calling the plays on game day. It’s quite a bonus whether you’re talking offence or defence to have that collaboration and multiple people giving input and game plans get put together better that way.”

Campbell added veteran CFL coach Joe Paopao to the offensive staff as running backs coach. Meanwhile, John McDonnell remains the offensive line coach, Winston October receivers coach and Beau Walker moves from offensive assistant to quarterbacks coach.

“There’s three guys here John McDonnell, Winston October and Beau Walker that know the offence very well. We didn’t want to change terminology or what we’re doing and we have a veteran group of players here that are the same so we needed someone to come in that could integrate themselves and still bring value at the same time,” Campbell said.

“It’s gotta be someone that was a good listener, someone with a lot of football knowledge, someone that understands football culture and how things work. And that they could integrate themselves in and learn and as they get more comfortable with the offence. A guy like Joe is a guy that can do a great job of coaching the running backs at the same time be a good sounding board and contribute to making game plans and doing all those things.”

After an 11-year playing career as a QB, Paopao became a CFL coach with stints as an offensive coordinator in B.C., Edmonton, Winnipeg and Hamilton. During four seasons as the bench boss in the nation’s capital, Paopao went 23-49 prior to the Renegades franchise folding.

“The timing worked out well, it was a unique situation, where we’re basically a month out from training camp and he was available. He’ll be a really good fit four our players and for the rest of the offensive staff. He’s already moved up here. This is how fast it’s gone,” Campbell said.

October will call the plays during games. October played six seasons in the CFL from 1999-2004, winning a Grey Cup in 2003 with the Edmonton Eskimos. Last season was October’s first coaching in the CFL after seven years at Virginia Military Institute junior college, two as a defensive backs coach and five as receivers coach, and four at the College of William and Mary as receivers coach.

“All three of the guys that have been here on our staff are capable and deserving of becoming coordinators. It’s not as uncommon as you might think in that staff’s that really work well together where it’s an offensive staff or a defensive staff, the best ones are done by collaboration,” Campbell said.

“You get input from everyone as far as the game plan as stuff is being installed during the week. On game day we want to have a clear protocol as far as what’s going on, so that’s going to be Winston’s role to call plays. I always have an influence on that regardless of who it is as far as when big decisions are made.”
From Skeletor to the Danse Macabre, from Army of Darkness to ossuaries and holy relics – despite being largely hidden in life, skeletons are some of the most recognizable structures that nature has produced. Science writer Brian Switek has written a sizzling little book with Skeleton Keys that delves into both the biological and cultural significance of human bones, showing them to be more than just a powerful reminder of death and mortality.

Switek starts off with a potted evolutionary history of the skeleton, taking the reader all the way back to the Cambrian, some 455 million years ago. The small fossils of Pikaia gracilens are some of the earliest evidence we have of the starting point of skeletal evolution. Looking for all the world like a small worm, it was one of the first creatures to possess a notochord, a cartilage-like structure that is the precursor of the backbone. (For a more technical exposé of that borderline between vertebrates and invertebrates, see my review of Across the Bridge: Understanding the Origin of the Vertebrates.)

He then hops, skips, and jumps to other significant milestones; fossils of the fish Entelognathus primordialis show the transition to jawed fish, while Tiktaalik roseae (see Your Inner Fish: The Amazing Discovery of Our 375-Million-Year-Old Ancestor) shows the transition of vertebrates moving onto land. He considers protomammals, the cynodonts, whose offspring lived through the age of the dinosaurs, and the primordial primates, noting how the changing skeleton acquired more and more traits we now think of as human.

This part is far from a complete overview of the evolution of skeletons (for that, see e.g. Skeletons: The Frame of Life), but that was never the intention. It does allow Switek to exercise his funny bone, wondering whether without the evolution of jaws the book and movie would instead be known as Pharyngeal Slit, or comparing the earliest invasion of land by plants to a prehistoric salad bar. At the same time, he is keen to correct misunderstandings about evolution: “It is easy to make categorical divisions between humans and apes when extinction has removed your ancestors”. Similarly, as Tiktaalik shows, any true invasion of land did not coincide with the origin of fingers and feet, with fish evolving into amphibians only millions of years later. This should do away with the misconception of evolution being goal-oriented (beyond, you know, making it to the next generation).

“Without the evolution of jaws, would the book and movie instead be known as Pharyngeal Slit?“

But we cannot dwell here any longer. Bone as living tissue is fascinating, and Switek introduces the physiology, with osteoblast cells continuously forming new bone while osteoclasts break it down again. Something that goes off kilter when astronauts spend months in space and lose bone mass. That makes hibernating bears all the more of a miracle, how do they not lose bone mass? Switek has the answer. Bone can be moulded in life, as seen by cultures around the world that change the shape of infants’ skulls, while in death it retains a personal history of disease and injury. Archaeologists are becoming increasingly skilful at elucidating these stories (see for example Injury and Trauma in Bioarchaeology: Interpreting Violence in Past Lives and Skeletons in Our Closet: Revealing Our Past through Bioarchaeology).

At this point Switek transitions seamlessly into the cultural significance of bone, and how especially skulls have become emblems of death. Neanderthals appear to have been much more sophisticated than we have long given them credit for, as evidenced by burials (see amongst others The Smart Neanderthal: Cave Art, Bird Catching, and the Cognitive Revolution), while his recounting of the exhumation of Richard III’s skeleton in a Leicester car park in 2012 is a fascinating archaeological detective story.

A far darker chapter that Switek tackles with panache is the heritage of anthropology. The pseudoscience of phrenology (where measurements of the bumps on a skull supposedly predicted someone’s mental capacities and traits) was long used to justify white man’s superiority. As he mentions, anthropology may not have invented racism, but it certainly fueled it through the 19th and 20th century. Switek is deeply troubled by the resurgence of the idea that race is biologically meaningful. As has been documented at length, there is more variation within populations than between populations, and the overlap between what we thought of as races is enormous (see also Sussman’s strident takedown in The Myth of Race: The Troubling Persistence of an Unscientific Idea).

“[…] anthropology may not have invented racism, but it certainly fueled it through the 19th and 20th century.”

This naturally leads on to the literal skeletons in the closets of many research collections. Lance Grande, a curator at Chicago’s Field Museum, dedicated a chapter to this in his book Curators: Behind the Scenes of Natural History Museums. The repatriation of old skeletons to for example Native American tribes, for whom the bones of the deceased hold particular spiritual significance, is becoming more commonplace. But not all museums are going along with it, as evidenced by Switek’s story of the skeleton of the Irish Giant Charles Byrne, who is still on display. Another one of those eye-opening tidbits in the book is his peek at the online trade in human bones on platforms such as eBay and Etsy (who have since cracked down on it), and now Instagram. You are far better off building your own.

Each chapter opens with a drawing from the 1733 book Osteographia or the Anatomy of Bones. These are lovely, and my only bone of contention (sorry) is that there aren’t more illustrations in the book. I would have loved to see some photos included, as Switek describes many wonderful things. For that, readers will have to turn to, for example, the work of palaeoartist John Gurche (see my review of Lost Anatomies: The Evolution of the Human Form) or, two of my personal favourites, Evolution in Action: Natural History Through Spectacular Skeletons and Skulls: An Exploration of Alan Dudley’s Curious Collection. Other slightly less spectacular but still noteworthy books are The Skeleton Revealed: An Illustrated Tour of the Vertebrates and Skeletons: The Extraordinary Form & Function of Bones.

Skeleton Keys is a multifaceted exploration of bones and their biological and cultural importance that is very absorbing. Far from a macabre gawk-fest (Skeletons! Eek!), Switek capably handles a range of serious topics, smoothly transitioning between them. The narrative sizzles, whether it is with witty jokes or genuine ire at the disrespect to bones and the questionable ideas they are used to prop up. An incredibly enjoyable book that comes highly recommended.

US government officials appear to be advancing a potential sale of nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia. Late last month, Reuters reported that Energy Secretary Rick Perry approved six secret authorizations for companies to do preliminary work on a Saudi nuclear deal without congressional oversight. The Reuters article followed an interim staff report that US Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, released in February; the report cited whistleblowers who had warned that the White House was trying to rush the transfer of nuclear technology to the Kingdom.

Many experts have expressed concern about the terms of a US-Saudi nuclear cooperation agreement now apparently under negotiation. Some despair at the very idea of transferring such sensitive technology to a regime known to have been involved in the gruesome murder of a prominent US-based journalist and to have led a bloody war in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia has attempted to justify its nuclear power program as a way to shift its electrical system away from fossil fuels, in part because of climate change concerns and in part because it is economically useful for the Kingdom to sell its oil and gas on the international market, rather than use them to generate electricity.

But for sun-baked Saudi Arabia, the economical and obvious switch is to solar energy, which also doesn’t result in carbon emissions and can be used to reduce domestic consumption of oil and gas. The limited efforts in installing solar power capacity on the part of the Saudi government suggest that climate action and economics may not be the driving motivations for its extensive nuclear energy plan. Indeed, members of the Saudi regime have, on other occasions, made it clear that their interests in nuclear energy derive from the idea that it would help them acquire the capability to make nuclear weapons and match Iran, whose regional status is seen to have risen as a result of its uranium enrichment program, even though it is now apparently limited by the Iran nuclear deal.

The contrast between Saudi Arabia’s solar potential and its focus on nuclear power raises a question: Why is the Trump administration so eager to provide nuclear technology to such a questionable partner? We offer some tentative answers to this question and argue that it would be best for the United States to stop trying to sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia, and to use its considerable diplomatic capacity to encourage other countries to do the same.

Outside inducement, inside interest. Despite President Trump’s outspoken interest in maintaining a close relationship with the Saudi leadership, the White House is not seeking a Saudi nuclear agreement entirely on its own volition. It is also responding to a major lobbying effort. In February, representatives from several nuclear energy firms, including NuScale, TerraPower, Westinghouse, and General Electric, met with President Trump reportedly with the aim of having the president “highlight the role US nuclear developers can play in providing power to other countries.”

The motivation for nuclear reactor suppliers is understandable. Thanks in part to the multibillion-dollar cost of reactors, the nuclear energy market is slim. One can literally count the number of new reactor construction projects starting each year since 2010 on the fingers of one hand. Westinghouse, the leading company among those that lobbied Trump, has not signed a new reactor contact in more than a decade. The Middle East has been an especially competitive market for companies interested in building reactors in the Kingdom. If any reactors are sold, it will only be with the help of high-level support, probably involving national governments or even heads of state.

But the effort to sell US nuclear power plants has also garnered some new players: companies involving ex-members of the armed forces. For about two years now, there have been reports of former national security advisor Michael Flynn playing an important role in trying to start nuclear exports to the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia. More recently, a host of articles have uncovered the role of the newly established IP3 Corporation (derived from International Peace, Power, and Prosperity), a company dominated by a number of retired military officials. The extent of IP3’s lobbying became apparent only after the House Oversight Committee report was published.

The influence trail is murky, and the various conflicts of interest within the Trump administration render the picture even murkier. One example is the case of Westinghouse and Jared Kushner, son in law of and senior advisor to President Donald Trump and a close friend of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Westinghouse is the largest nuclear reactor supplier in the United States, but, thanks to cost escalations in multiple projects involving its AP1000 nuclear reactor design, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017. It was then purchased by the Canadian company Brookfield Business Partners. Brookfield Business Partners is a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which reached a deal in August 2018 with the Kushner family’s real estate company to lease a highly unprofitable building in New York. The Kushner company had purchased 666 Fifth Avenue in New York for $1.8 billion in 2007, just before the property markets collapsed. The company had been trying for years to offload this debt. Brookfield’s deal might be just a coincidence, but the timing and the earlier foray into the nuclear business raise obvious conflict of interest questions.

Many reasons for the US interest in selling reactors to Saudi Arabia have been put forward. Some involve the economic health of the US nuclear industry. Some involve national security; it has been argued that Russia, China, or other countries will supply the Kingdom with reactors, if the United States does not, providing few or none of the proliferation controls that a US agreement might include. Still, the conflict of interest questions must be answered, before a true appraisal of US security interests in providing reactors to Saudi Arabia can be made.

Nuclear energy makes little economic sense in Saudi Arabia. If interest in nuclear deal-making is tangled and conflict-ridden on the American side, the nature of Saudi interest in nuclear power seems to lie hidden in plain sight. According to a royal decree issued in 2010, the “development of atomic energy is essential to meet the Kingdom’s growing requirements for energy to generate electricity, produce desalinated water, and reduce reliance on depleting hydrocarbon resources.” Now, fossil fuels produce the vast majority of Saudi Arabia’s electricity. While switching away from these fuels makes enormous sense, switching to nuclear energy does not.

As a desert kingdom, Saudi Arabia has some of the best solar energy resources in the world. Studies show that “photovoltaic technologies would perform well at any location” in the country because of high levels of solar irradiance. Despite government rhetoric to the contrary, the country has not been pursuing solar energy fast enough. As of 2017, Saudi Arabia had a total of 92 megawatts of installed renewable energy capacity, 89 megawatts of solar photovoltaics and three megawatts of wind. According to the 2017 version of BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy, Saudi Arabia generated a mere 0.04 percent of its electricity from solar energy in 2017, up from 0.01 percent in 2012. The United Kingdom generated a comparable amount of electricity overall in 2017, but solar energy contributed 3.4 percent of this total, even though that country is much further north than Saudi Arabia.

Solar energy has both lower investment costs and lower generation costs than nuclear power. The Wall Street consulting company Lazard publishes annual figures for these costs for different technologies. In 2018, the Lazard estimate for the construction cost of a nuclear plant in the United States was over $9,000 per kilowatt and each megawatt-hour of electricity produced cost around $150. In contrast, a utility-scale solar plant in the United States would cost around $1,100 per kilowatt and each megawatt-hour of electricity would cost around $40.

Such comparisons have been carried out for other countries too; solar energy is typically the better choice. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimated in 2016 that if India were to import a nuclear power plant from Westinghouse, electricity from this reactor would cost at least three times more than electricity from solar photovoltaics. The economic case in Saudi Arabia is likely to be even more favorable for solar power.

When confronted with the economic superiority of solar energy, some nuclear power advocates argue that the comparison is not relevant because solar energy is intermittent, i.e., it can only be generated when the sun is shining. But this argument is misleading, especially in the case of Saudi Arabia, for three reasons. First, intermittency begins to affect cost of maintaining the reliability of the grid even mildly only when the fraction of electricity being generated by such intermittent sources of energy becomes significant, say around 20 percent. Given that solar energy generated a mere 0.04 percent of all the electricity generated in Saudi Arabia, its capacity can expand by a factor of about 500 before any investment has to be made in balancing for intermittency. Second, for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia will be generating electricity from natural gas and diesel based plants, and these are flexible enough for their outputs to be increased and decreased according to whether solar plants are not producing or generating electricity at any given time. Thus, the fraction of solar can be considerably higher before intermittency begins to pose an economic problem. Finally, the costs of storage technologies, such as batteries, are falling rapidly and might already be becoming cheap enough that solar energy will be economically competitive even after the addition of storage.

Given this clear economic advantage for solar energy, the question to ask is: If Saudi officials are indeed interested in reducing reliance on hydrocarbons and meet growing electricity requirements, why are they not aggressively investing in solar energy?

Another reason for Saudi interest in nuclear technology. Saudi officials have made it clear on more than one occasion that there is another reason for being interested in nuclear energy technology, which was not captured by the royal decree on the Saudi nuclear program: the relationship of that program to nuclear weapons. In March 2018, Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News, “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” The key phrase is “as soon as possible.” Developing nuclear weapons quickly will require that Saudi Arabia put in place the necessary wherewithal. This is where nuclear energy seems to come in.

The relationship between nuclear energy and weapons was clearly understood at the very dawn of the nuclear age. The 1946 Acheson-Lilienthal plan warned:

“The development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and the development of atomic energy for bombs are in much of their course interchangeable and interdependent. From this it follows that although nations may agree not to use in bombs the atomic energy developed within their borders the only assurance that a conversion to destructive purposes would not be made would be the pledged word and the good faith of the nation itself. This fact puts an enormous pressure upon national good faith.”

Following some of the recent actions of Saudi Arabia and the history of officials explicitly indicating that, under some circumstances, they would develop nuclear weapons, there is no reason to place such faith in the regime.

The ostensible rationale for Saudi nuclear weapon interests—Iran—offers an example of the lack of faith. Iranian officials, all the way to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claim that the country is not developing nuclear weapons. Yet, successive US administrations have refused to trust the Iranians and have spent enormous diplomatic and political capital seeking to curb Iran’s nuclear program. In the case of Saudi Arabia, there is good reason to expect that the country is acquiring nuclear infrastructure precisely to advance its nuclear weapons ambitions.

Why exactly is there a linkage between nuclear energy and nuclear weapon capacity? There are two separate elements, the technical and the institutional. Any nuclear power plant that is under consideration in Saudi Arabia will need to be fueled with uranium that is typically enriched in the uranium-235 component. Saudi officials would like to acquire not just nuclear power plants but have also hinted at the possibility that they want the technology to enrich uranium. It was also been reported that “Western and Israeli intelligence services” observed “signs that” Saudi Arabia’s interest “extends into nuclear enrichment.”

Just as with Iran, the same enrichment technology can be used to produce fuel or produce fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.

Further, all nuclear reactors produce plutonium, which, if separated from spent reactor fuel, can also be used to make nuclear weapons. In principle, this plutonium could be placed under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Whether Saudi Arabia will agree to such safeguards is not yet determined; the country has not even instituted safeguards on the small research reactor it is constructing. Regardless of whether or not Saudi Arabia agrees to safeguards, there is always the possibility that a country could withdraw from these safeguards, as happened with North Korea.

Saudi Arabia’s acquisition of nuclear power plants could also contribute to its nuclear weapons quest by providing a reason for training personnel in the many skills that are involved in both pursuits. Finally, there is an extensive literature in political science demonstrating the importance of atomic energy institutions to creating bureaucratic momentum to developing nuclear weapons.

The bottom line: If Saudi Arabia—or any other country, for that matter—acquires nuclear power plants, it will have gained some capability to make nuclear weapons, unless enrichment of uranium and reprocessing technologies are somehow regulated. Whether that capability is turned into actual weapons depends largely on political inclination. On that there is no need for speculation, thanks to numerous pronouncements by Saudi leaders.

Three reasons to question. Three aspects of the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia demand attention. The first, which has received much media attention, involves the opaque tangle of shady talks and negotiations between the Trump administration and the Kingdom, in the realm of nuclear energy and in other areas. Second, it is clear that nuclear energy makes little economic sense for Saudi Arabia, suggesting that there are other motives for its nuclear power program. Third, one of these motives need no longer be the subject of speculation: Saudi Arabia’s leaders have clearly stated their interest in potentially developing nuclear weapons. The acquisition of nuclear power and associated technology could well aid that process.

Given these questions, neither the United States nor any other country should be exporting nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia. This will not just be in the interest of the United States, but also in the economic interest of the Saudis. To the extent that there is concern that other countries like Russia and China might step in and sell nuclear reactors to Saudi Arabia, the obvious corollary is that the United States should use its considerable diplomatic capacity to discourage such efforts. Success is, of course, not guaranteed, but not trying is the surest way to fail.
In many of our articles, we talk about our mission to bring digital asset trading to the mainstream. But what exactly do we mean by this and how realistic a prospect is it?

The team at OAX Foundation is driven by the same belief that digital assets offer many benefits to society. These range from providing simpler, faster and cheaper transactions to helping significantly reduce the risk of fraud. And the underlying blockchain technology arguably has even more potential uses, from helping authenticate antiques to a tamper proof system of land registration.

The potential digital assets hold isn’t in question. What is less obvious is whether they’ll ever be able to achieve that potential. And that’s what we really mean by saying that we want digital assets to move into the mainstream. We don’t want them to remain a quirk of the financial system, treated as special and distinct from other financial products — with separate conferences and a separate investor audience. Rather we foresee a time when digital assets are just another part of the financial system, fully integrated into our daily lives whenever we think about banking, saving or financing businesses.

We also believe that time isn’t too far in the future. Lots still needs to be done to get there, which is where we at OAX Foundation come in. We believe openness, transparency and governance are the keys which will unlock the future for digital assets.

We’re not just saying this out of blind optimism. We’re talking from experience. As a new asset class, digital assets are following a path which will be familiar to everyone who follows innovation trends within any industry. At first interest is small and the innovation is championed by just a few. Then more and more people catch on and the innovation grows in popularity until, inevitably, the hype runs away from reality before a reassessment and retrenchment finally mean the innovation finds its rightful place in society — and ceases to be an innovation at all.

Arguably, we’re at such an inflection point now with digital assets. Bitcoin prices have come down from the highs of a year or so ago and this is allowing people to examine digital assets with a renewed sense of realism. The situation we find ourselves in now is much more conducive to developing the processes, tools and regulation needed to help the industry carve out a sustainable position for itself within the wider financial services industry, not separate from it.

That’s why we see what we do at OAX Foundation as critical and why we believe the digital asset industry — and financial services more broadly — need organizations like ours more than ever before.
Open this photo in gallery Former NFL and CFL player, Cierre Wood appears in court on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 in Las Vegas. Wood, arrested on suspicion of child abuse, now faces murder charges after his girlfriend's five-year-old daughter died. The Canadian Press

A Las Vegas judge expressed shock Tuesday at the severity of injuries found on a five-year-old girl whose death led to murder and felony child abuse charges against her 25-year-old mother and the mother’s former professional football player boyfriend.

“Once you’ve seen them, you can’t ever unsee them,” Justice of the Peace Melanie Andress-Tobiasson said of the images as she rejected a bid by La’Rayah Davis’ mother, Amy Taylor, for release on bail pending a May 21 preliminary hearing of evidence or indictments in the case. The photos were not made public.

Taylor sobbed as she and former NFL and Canadian Football League running back Cierre Wood, 28, stood shackled in court.

“She is innocent until proven otherwise,” said Sarah Hawkins, Taylor’s court-appointed public defender.

Wood spoke only to say he understood the charges. His attorney, Thomas Ericsson, said Wood maintained his innocence and Ericsson may file a written request for his release on bail.

Prosecutor Michelle Jobe said a grand jury is expected to hear evidence about the April 9 death La’Rayah, and cited Taylor’s statement to police that she sat on the girl while disciplining her about a week before her death.

Jobe said La’Rayah died with internal injuries to her lungs and diaphragm, and the judge noted what she called “injuries consistent with extreme abuse” including a lacerated liver, broken ribs and “severe injuries from the child’s forehead to the child’s about mid-thighs.”

Paramedics reported finding the girl unresponsive at Wood’s apartment, where Taylor, a certified nurse’s aide, and the girl moved in after Taylor and Wood began dating late last year. La’Rayah was pronounced dead at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center.

The Clark County coroner ruled she died of multiple injuries and ruled her death a homicide.

Taylor told detectives that she and Wood were the only two people who could have killed the child, “so it had to be one of us,” according to a police report.

Wood told investigators he spanked the girl once when she misbehaved, but Taylor disapproved so he adopted exercise as discipline. He called it “learning through fun.”

Wood played football for Notre Dame before stints with Houston, New England and Buffalo in the NFL and Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League.

He told detectives he had La’Rayah do sit-ups and other exercises including running sprints in their apartment, and that the day she died La’Rayah fell backward while doing sit-ups and hit her head on the carpeted floor.

Taylor told police she was at a grocery store at the time.

Sob pressão dos caminhoneiros, que ameaçavam reeditar uma paralisação que fará um ano em maio, o governo tomou duas medidas emergenciais: adiou o aumento do diesel e lançou um pacote de benefícios de forma a melhorar a rentabilidade da atividade e as condições de trabalho da categoria.

Tal qual o tabelamento do frete e outras medidas tomadas pelo governo Temer —que permanecem—, as iniciativas não serão eficazes. São, na melhor das hipóteses, paliativas, em razão de um cálculo político realista: o país ainda é refém dos caminhoneiros autônomos, e quebrar a espinha de uma greve necessitaria com toda a probabilidade da aplicação da Lei de Segurança Nacional e de uma intervenção das Forças Armadas em caráter decisivo. Não se vislumbra apetite no governo para exercer essa opção.

Qual o problema estrutural do mercado de fretes rodoviários? Um desequilíbrio entre oferta e demanda que levou à queda dos fretes e à dificuldade de segmentos dos caminhoneiros de pagar seus custos profissionais e suas contas domésticas.

A situação se tornou crítica pela combinação de baixo crescimento econômico e aumento do preço do petróleo (e, logo, do custo direto e de oportunidade da Petrobras).

Infelizmente, esses fatores continuam a operar neste ano: estamos contratando um repique do ano passado —um crescimento medíocre, e o preço do barril permanece acima de US$ 70 o barril, próximo aos valores de 12 meses atrás, antevéspera da greve.

Qual a saída? No médio prazo, o mercado de frete necessita se ajustar, reduzindo a sobreoferta. Controle de preços, tabelas e outras intervenções levam na realidade a aprofundar o desequilíbrio: os caminhoneiros menos competitivos adiam a saída do mercado; e os donos de carga verticalizam suas frotas e procuram alternativas (ferrovias, cabotagem, hidrovias).

Esse processo já está acontecendo, e o mercado para os autônomos tende a encolher, agravando a situação particularmente desse segmento.

As medidas do governo pouco fazem para suavizar o ajuste do mercado, ainda que melhorar a qualidade das estradas mais perigosas, ou prover áreas de descanso (desde que seguras), ou ainda desburocratizar esse mercado sejam ações bem-vindas.

No longo prazo, o desafio é ampliar os investimentos em transportes e melhorar sua alocação e eficiência.

Nossa matriz de transportes é distorcida, com uma participação excessiva de rodovias no transporte de cargas (entre 63% e 71%, dependendo do critério adotado), muito acima de países de grande extensão territorial, a exemplo dos EUA (38%).

Inversamente, as ferrovias, as hidrovias e as dutovias no país ainda têm uma participação de segunda ordem. Melhorar a qualidade da nossa malha de transportes, resolver os gargalos e reduzir os custos logísticos (que consomem perto de 12% do PIB, ante 8% a 9% em países continentais) irá demandar um esforço da ordem de 2% do PIB em investimentos por cerca de duas décadas, algo como três vezes o que vimos investindo nos últimos 15 anos.

Nessa perspectiva, há dois conjuntos de imperativos:

1) reduzir a insegurança jurídica, melhorar o ambiente regulatório e ampliar as concessões para incentivar o investimento privado; e

2) reformar o Estado e reestruturar seus gastos para voltar a abrir espaço para investimentos públicos que permanecem imprescindíveis.

Um suspeito, ainda não identificado, invadiu o 77º DP (Santa Cecília), e levou 29 celulares mantidos no distrito, após serem apreendidos com criminosos em janeiro de 2018 e março deste ano. O criminoso também furtou o distintivo de um escrivão, além e urinar e defecar dentro da delegacia. O caso ocorreu por volta das 7h do último sábado (13).

Homem suspeito de furtar 29 celulares no 77º DP (Santa Cecília) - Reprodução/Polícia Civil

Câmeras do distrito registraram a ação do criminoso. Segundo as imagens o ladrão, de barba e vestindo uma camiseta amarela, sobe em uma viatura da Polícia Científica, estacionada na lateral da delegacia.

Após subir no veículo, o criminoso entra no prédio por um vão, usado para colocar ar-condicionado, equipamento inexistente na abertura.

Foi registrado em boletim de ocorrência que o suspeito primeiramente entrou no Cartório 3 da delegacia. "Foi constatada [por policiais após o furto] a subtração do distintivo [de um escrivão], uma mochila preta e celulares, apreendidos em inquéritos policiais", diz trecho do documento policial.

Na sequência, o bandido foi ao Cartório 4 do distrito, onde segundo a polícia "vandalizou" o local, onde também urinou e defecou. Em seguida, ele fugiu com os aparelhos.

Parte dos celulares furtados foram apreendidos por policiais do 77º DP em janeiro do ano passado. Segundo boletim de ocorrência, agentes encontraram 22 aparelhos na mochila de um casal, em um quarto de hotel no bairro de Santa Cecília (região central de SP).

Os demais telefones furtados pelo suspeito haviam sido apreendidos, em 20 de março deste ano, dentro de uma loja na Consolação (região central de SP), durante a operação "Mobile", realizada para prender suspeitos de receptar aparelhos roubados e furtados.

Resposta

A SSP (Secretaria da Segurança Pública), gestão João Doria (PSDB), afirmou que a Polícia Civil investiga o furto ocorrido dentro da delegacia. "A autoridade analisa imagens e realiza diligências para identificar e prender o autor. A Corregedoria da Polícia Civil acompanha o caso", diz trecho de nota.

Outros casos

Recentemente, o Agora publicou sobre o furto de ao menos 81 armas de fogo de dentro da Delegacia Central de Cotia (Grande SP). O crime foi constatado, quando o escrivão-chefe do distrito precisou encaminhar armas à Justiça. Quatro pessoas foram presas na ocasião, incluindo um auxiliar administrativo que prestava serviços na delegacia.

O Agora também publicou, em outubro do ano passado, reportagem sobre o sumiço de quase uma tonelada de maconha (900 kg) de dentro do 1º DP (Sé), na Liberdade (região central).

O sumiço, registrado como furto no distrito, aconteceu no dia 17 de agosto.

Segundo o documento policial, a chefe dos escrivães da delegacia na ocasião, relacionava e conferia armas e drogas apreendidas e guardadas em um depósito no subsolo da delegacia.

Ela iria repassar as informações ao seu sucessor, pois iria para outra delegacia. A conferência era feita havia dois dias.

Durante a vistoria, ainda de acordo com o boletim de ocorrência, a policial, de 53 anos, constatou que 50 sacos de maconha haviam sido furtados do local.

In the coming years, NASA has some bold plans to build on the success of the New Horizons mission. Not only did this spacecraft make history by conducting the first-ever flyby of Pluto in 2015, it has since followed up on that by making the first encounter in history with a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) – 2014 MU69 (aka Ultima Thule).

Given the wealth of data and stunning images that resulted from these events (which NASA scientists are still processing), other similarly-ambitious missions to explore the outer solar system are being considered. For example, there is the proposal for the Trident spacecraft, a Discovery-class mission that would reveal things about Neptune's largest moon, Triton.

These findings were presented at the 50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2019, which took place from March 19th to 22nd in The Woodlands, Texas. This annual conference allows planetary science specialists from around the world to come together to share mission proposals and the latest results from their respective fields of research.

It was here that Karl L. Mitchell and his colleagues from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) presented their proposal for a cost-effective flyby mission of Triton. The idea calls for a spacecraft powered by a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) battery that would fit under the Discovery Program's cost gap.

As they state in their paper, this mission would be a cost-effective way to build on the successes of the New Horizons mission:

"New Horizons has effectively demonstrated the scientific value of fast flybys in the outer solar system. Trident's encounter with Triton will be similarly rapid, using remote sensing instruments with large apertures and high angular resolution sensors that operate millions to tens of thousands of kilometers before closest approach. Data is collected over several days around the encounter, and returned over the course of one year."

This mission would launch by 2026 to take advantage of a rare alignment of the planets, which would allow for an efficient gravity assist with Jupiter and a flyby of Triton during an opportune time in its orbit. The timing would also be favorable because it would allow the mission to witness seasonal changes that are currently taking place on Neptune's largest moon.

These changes are a result of Triton's tilted orbit around Neptune (~23°, relative to the equator), which causes one hemisphere to experience summer while the other experiences winter. When one hemisphere is experiencing summer, the frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide on Triton's surface sublimates into gas, which thickens the atmosphere.

When the seasons change, which happens every 40 years, this gas then freezes and descends to form ice on the surface again. The last mission to visit Triton was the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which conducted a flyby of the moon in 1989 when the planet was experiencing spring. When astronomers observed the moon in 2010 using the Very Large Telescope (VLT), they noted that the atmosphere thickened considerably.

This was consistent with the change of seasons on Triton, which had passed the summer solstice by 2000 and then began to cool. By 2026, the southern hemisphere will be experiencing winter, which means that the Trident mission will be able to get a more complete picture of seasonal changes on the moon. In addition, the Trident mission will be able to witness Triton's plume activity and study it more closely.

These plumes are the result of Triton being geologically active (unlike most moons in the solar system). This results in cryovolcanism, where liquid ammonia and nitrogen gas burst through the surface and send material to altitudes of up to 8 km (5 mi). Investigating these plumes will reveal things about Triton's subsurface environment, which is believed to harbor an interior ocean.

Much like Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan, Ceres and other bodies in the solar system, this ocean is believed to be the result of geothermal heating at the core-mantle boundary. Combined with the presence of organic molecules, the presence of liquid water and energy could also mean that Triton is capable of supporting life.

In this respect, a mission to Triton would be consistent with the goals set by the NASA Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) group, which is overseen by the agency's Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG). The same holds true of the 2013 Planetary Decadal Survey, which prioritized the exploration of ocean worlds in our solar system in the hopes of finding evidence of life.

Last, but not least, a mission to Triton would also help resolve ongoing questions about the origin of this mysterious moon. Currently, the most widely accepted theory is that Triton was actually a minor planet that was kicked out of the Kuiper Belt and captured by Neptune. Recent studies have also shown that its arrival likely destroyed Neptune's existing moons, the debris of which combined to form what we see there today.

Clearly, one of the greatest accomplishments of the New Horizons mission is that it has renewed interest in the exploration of the outer solar system. After the historic Voyager missions passed beyond the orbit of Neptune, there was a bit of a lull as research became more focused on missions to low Earth orbit (LEO) and Earth's immediate neighbors.

But by directing attention to the outer solar system with a number of missions planned for the next decade, we stand to learn more about the formation and evolution of the solar system. With any luck, we might even find telltale indicators of extra-terrestrial life, which will be the single-greatest discovery in the history of space exploration.

A Petrobras decidiu vender a partir de junho deste ano metade das refinarias de petróleo. As refinarias ficam nas regiões Sul, Sudeste e Nordeste.

Juntas, as 13 refinarias da Petrobras tinham capacidade de refinar 2,2 milhões de barris por dia em 2018. Ou seja, o objetivo da empresa é vender a capacidade de refino de 1,1 milhão de barris por dia.

O objetivo é encaminhar o modelo de privatização ao Conselho Administrativo de Defesa e Econômica (Cade) ainda neste mês.

A análise pelo Cade é uma etapa importante porque a ideia é criar competição no mercado, evitando a concentração das refinarias em um mesmo grupo privado.

O objetivo também é evitar monopólio regional. Assim, a empresa que comprar a refinaria do Rio Grande do Sul, por exemplo, não poderá comprar a do Paraná.

Em junho, a Petrobras:

anunciará formalmente a venda das refinarias;

qualificará os interessados;

começará a analisar as propostas.

O processo de venda das refinarias já está acertado com o Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU).

Arrecadação

A Petrobras espera arrecadar entre US$10 e US$ 15 bilhões com a venda das refinarias. O objetivo é usar os recursos para reduzir as dívidas.

O monopólio da Petrobras na área de refino não está previsto em lei. É, contudo, um monopólio de fato.

Grupos privados não buscam investir no refino de petróleo no Brasil porque o mercado tem sofrido intervenção nas últimas décadas, principalmente nos governos de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e de Dilma Rousseff.

Por lei, os preços são livres desde 2002. Mas, como o governo tem poder de nomeação e demissão, a direção da Petrobras fica submissa à vontade do governo.

Para a Petrobras, o monopólio é uma armadilha. Quando o governo intervém na política de preços, a empresa perde por vender abaixo de custo.

The alleged “ringleader” of an animal rights group accused of stealing a dead piglet as well as a $1500 fresian calf from two separate WA farms will likely spend the night in jail after he was unable to provide surety.

James Warden, 25, who is part of the Direct Action Everywhere group which orchestrated anti-meat protests around the country, appeared in Perth Magistrates Court today charged with two counts of aggravated burglary, two counts of stealing and three counts of trespass.

The charged relate to incidents at Nambellup, Hopeland, West Pinjarra and Brunswick between August and November last year.

The unemployed vegan is accused of stealing a dead piglet from a Pinjarra piggery then displaying it as part of a protest outside fast food outlets in Belmont in September 2018.

He is also accused of trespassing on a farm in Brunswick and stealing an 11-day-old fresian calf worth $1500, which was later moved to an animal rescue farm in Waroona.

During the hearing, the court was told Mr Warden was arrested in New South Wales after a warrant had been issued for him by officers from the State Security Investigations Unit.

He appeared at Wollongong Court where he was given bail to appear in Perth Magistrates Court today.

Mr Warden’s lawyer Marilyn Loveday told the court her client was in NSW visiting his family and was not aware he was wanted in WA, adding she could not believe officers from this unit would “go to the extent of having someone extradited” over the charges.

She also objected to some of the bail conditions set for her client, describing them as “draconian”.

Initially, Mr Warden was ordered to surrender his passport, not leave WA, cut off all communication from members of DAE, adhere to a curfew and stay away from all farms that deals with livestock.

Police prosecutors told the court the measures were necessary given the seriousness of Warden’s alleged crimes.

She said following the protest outside the Belmont fast food outlet, an search warrant was issued for a house in Maylands which uncovered phones and other devices containing pictures of dead animals and meta data linking them to the time and location of where they were taken.

She also said police believed Mr Warden was a flight risk, arguing officers received information he had bought an international air ticket and should be banned from communicating with members of the activist group because of a risk of re-offending.

Ms Loveday objected to surrendering the passport, saying her client no longer had one after losing it two years ago.

She said not allowing him to communicate with members of DAE, who she said was his only friends, and not being able to visit any produce farm was unfair.

In determining bail, Magistrate Joe Randazzo warned Mr Warden if he breached bail he would be “dicing with his freedom”.

He removed Mr Warden’s curfew and allowed him to continue to communicate with his “friends” but ordered that he is not to possess any passport or be within 500 metres of any Australian departure point or leave WA.

He also banned Mr Warden from being near any farm and to report to police every Friday. Bail was set bail at a $10,000 personal undertaking and a $5000 surety.

However Mr Warden was unable to provide the $5000 surety and was remanded into custody.

He is expected to next appear in court on May 3 in Mandurah
You’ve probably heard about microdosing, the “productivity hack” popular among Silicon Valley engineers and business leaders. Microdosers take regular small doses of LSD or magic mushrooms. At these doses, they don’t experience mind-bending, hallucinatory trips, but they say they get a jolt in creativity and focus that can elevate work performance, help relationships, and generally improve a stressful and demanding daily life. If its proponents are to be believed, microdosing offers the cure for an era dominated by digital distractions and existential anxiety—a cup of coffee with a little Tony Robbins stirred in.

So far, though, it’s been impossible to separate truth from hype. That’s because, until recently, microdoses haven’t been tested in placebo-controlled trials. Late last year, the first placebo-controlled microdose trial was published. The study concluded that microdoses of LSD appreciably altered subjects’ sense of time, allowing them to more accurately reproduce lapsed spans of time. While it doesn’t prove that microdoses act as a novel cognitive enhancer, the study starts to piece together a compelling story on how LSD alters the brain’s perceptive and cognitive systems in a way that could lead to more creativity and focus.

The idea behind microdosing traces its roots back decades. In the 1950s, a handful of psychedelic therapists at a mental health facility in Saskatchewan wanted to help alcoholics get clean. They guided the patients through a high dose, ego-dissolving, LSD experience. When they came out the other side, over half of the patients reported complete recovery from alcoholism. The Canadian government was intrigued and ordered more rigorous trials, this time with placebo controls, and without the experienced “trip guides” offering suggestions on what patients should feel. These trials were a bust. In the fall-out, many viewed psychedelic therapy as more shamanism than science. The mindset of the user and suggestion from the therapist (termed “set and setting” to LSD proponents) are just as important as the drug itself. In other words, LSD’s effects had as much to do with goings on outside the brain as inside it. To LSD proponents, though, this was part of how it worked. “Set and setting” guard against a bad trip (with large doses), and give the user an idea of what they should experience.

Microdosing is born from this “set and setting” school of psychedelic therapy and one of its intellectual progeny, James Fadiman. The Stanford-trained Fadiman has worked with psychedelics for decades and runs a kind of cottage industry around espousing their powers. In his 2011 book “The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide” and at a conference talk that same year, Fadiman laid out the concept of microdosing. To microdose, one was to take a dose roughly 1/10th of a trip-inducing dose (10 micrograms of LSD) every 3 or 4 days, and go about their daily life.

Most of what’s known about the benefits of microdosing comes from self-reports Fadiman collected (and continues to collect) where microdosers described how the practice transformed their lives. In them, microdosers speak of anxiety and depression melting away, and feelings of determination and self-resolve that helped them achieve professional success. Some color-blind men even saw color for the first time.

The self-reporting experiment doesn’t involve placebos or self-blinding, where participants hide dosage information from themselves, and thus is extremely susceptible to observer-expectancy bias. For his part, Fadiman admits that what he does is more “search” than research. But, it’s quite clear that a prospective microdoser gets expectancy bias (or the right “set and setting” depending on who you ask) from online journalism, Reddit (r/microdosing has close to 50,000 subscribers), or even a consultant. This makes the phenomenon of microdosing more similar to the fringy 1950s Saskatchewan studies than the serious-minded psychedelic research that’s sprung up parallel to it.

The phenomenon has gotten so much attention, though, and the claims are so intriguing, that some scientists are attempting to test them with some rigor. A group of psychologists at Goldsmiths, University of London, led by Devin Terhune, published the first placebo-controlled study on microdosing in late 2018. Terhune recruited volunteers who hadn’t used LSD in the preceding 5 years and randomly assigned them into placebo or LSD microdose groups.

Terhune first addressed a simple, but actually elusive question: are you supposed to feel a microdose of LSD? Many online resources describe microdoses as “sub-perceptual.” In other words, no, you’re not supposed to feel the drug take effect. This makes LSD microdoses closer to an antidepressant like Prozac than a truly psychoactive substance like caffeine or marijuana. Others argue that, no, you should feel the microdose, and if you don’t, it’s not working. As part of a questionnaire, subjects were asked the simple question, “Do you feel the drug?” Interestingly, Terhune found no statistical difference in responses to that question between the placebo and LSD groups. Though this study was limited in scale, it argues that, no, you’re not actually feeling anything when you microdose.

But does a microdose change brain function in a sub-perceptual way? There’s a myriad of ways to test this, but Terhune looked specifically at the way the subjects perceive time. When shown a blue dot on a screen for a specific length of time, the subjects were asked to recreate that length of time by pressing a key. Typically, with longer time intervals, people under-represent time (i.e. hold the key down for a shorter period of time than reality). In the study, those who received microdoses held the key longer, better representing the actual time interval.

Does this mean microdosing makes you smarter? Terhune and his co-authors were cautious in over-interpreting their finding. For one, it’s not clear that perceiving time more accurately is preferable. The brain seems to favor under-representing time for reasons that are unclear. Disrupting the brain’s default way of representing time, though, may beneficial in certain daily tasks or creative pursuits. That’s not clear yet, and the relationship between time perception and cognitive function needs to be further developed. Importantly, though, the finding does show that microdoses changed brain function in some way, despite not inducing a strong drug “feeling.”

As Devin Terhune and others start testing the meatier microdosing claims with rigorous methods, the era of psychedelic research that James Fadiman had a hand in creating is closing. Organizations that fund psychedelic research are showing more interest in testing microdoses alongside placebo controls. One study, according to its website, will test “the short-term effects of various sizes of LSD microdose on creativity, cognitive flexibility, and wellbeing” and “brain activity, cognitive functions and mood” over a four week period.

So what’s riding on these studies? For those that are already convinced of microdosing’s powers, probably not much. But quite a lot is at stake for our broader understanding of the brain and the potential for drugs—LSD or otherwise—to enhance cognitive abilities. Unlike large doses of psychedelics, microdoses don’t dissolve your ego. You don’t become a better version of yourself by falling apart and coming back together, like the Saskatchewan alcoholics. Instead, the mythology around microdosing tells a different, and perhaps even more compelling story. Through straightforward pharmacology, microdoses may activate just the right amount of receptors for us to be our better selves.
It’s about 3,500 kilometres from the city where he was born but for Tevaun Smith, signing with the Edmonton Eskimos is like coming home.

Smith, a native of Toronto, was selected eighth overall by the Eskimos in the 2016 CFL draft. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound wide receiver who attended the University of Iowa decided to try and land a job in the NFL first.

Over the next three seasons he dressed for two games during stints with the Indianapolis Colts, Oakland Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars before signing with the Eskimos in February.

“It’s going back to where I started,’ said Smith, who is currently training in Charlotte but plans to spend time working out with other CFL players in Toronto prior to the opening of training camp. “It’s going to be good to talk the Canadian game again.

“Edmonton is a great spot. They run their program like what I’m used to. I’ve been out there a couple times already, met a couple of the players. I’m excited to get out there and not only get myself better but make everybody else in the receivers’ room better also.”

After being released by the Jaguars Smith contemplated signing with the Alliance of American Football — which has since folded — or even the XFL, which is scheduled to begin play next year. Instead he opted for the reliability of the CFL.

“I wanted to keep all my doors open,” he said. “To be honest, I’m from Canada. I love being a Canadian, playing in a country where I’m from and getting all the support, compared to going somewhere the league might fold.

“I’d rather be somewhere I’m secure. I know the league has been around for a long time. I’ve got support already from CFL players in the league that I’ve known since high school.”

Adding Smith to the roster fills a void for the Eskimos who lost three of their top receivers over the winter. Duke Williams, who led the CFL last season with 1,579 yards on 153 catches signed with the NFL Buffalo Bills while Bryant Mitchell (60 catches, 867 yards) joined the Arizona Cardinals.

Derel Walker (51 catches, 875 yards) signed as a free agent with the Toronto Argonauts.

During his four years in Iowa Smith made 102 catches for 1,500 yards and seven touchdowns. He brings size, speed and a dedicated work ethic to Edmonton.

“I’m happy to get out there and play and compete for a starting sport,” said Smith.

“I feel like I can be a physical receiver if I need to be. I work hard. Every day I’m going to come in and work my butt off and do what ever I have to do to help the team win.

“I came from a program that pushes their players really hard. That’s in my blood. I want to get better every day and make everybody around me better.”

“I know he’s excited. He checks in every now and then, makes sure I’m good. I like that in a quarterback. He’s trying to get to know his players really fast.” Smith on his new QB, Trevor Harris

When quarterback Mike Reilly left Edmonton to joint the BC Lions, the Eskimos quickly signed free agent Trevor Harris.

Smith and Harris spoke soon after signing with Edmonton and remain in contact.

“I know he’s excited,” said Smith. “He checks in every now and then, makes sure I’m good. I like that in a quarterback. He’s trying to get to know his players really fast.”

It can take time for a new quarterback and receiver to get on the same page but adapting shouldn’t be a problem for Smith. While at Iowa, he played with C.J. Beathard, now with San Francisco, and Jake Rudock, who played for the Detroit Lions before signing with Miami.

While in the NFL, Smith caught passes from Andrew Luck, Stephen Morris, Derek Carr, EJ Manuel, Blake Bortles and Cody Kessler.

“That right there is six different quarterbacks,” he said.

Smith attended Chaminade College School in Toronto, where he credits head coach Pat Diodati for putting him on the road toward becoming a professional.

“He helped me when it came to film, when it came to working out, pushing me to be better every day,” Smith said. “I thank him for all he’s done.”

While at Chaminade, Smith trained with Eskimos receiver Natey Adjei and linebacker Chris Mulumba-Tshimanga.

Before going to Iowa, Smith spent a year at a Connecticut prep school.

Having spent time away from Canada, Smith admits he’s had to brush up again on the Canadian game.

“A big thing was getting used to the waggle,” he said. “I still don’t remember all the rules. It’s going to click once we start going at it every single day. I’m going to continue to learn.”

Smith isn’t the first Canadian selected in the CFL draft who tested his luck in the NFL. Looking back, he had no regrets.

Going to the States gave him a chance to practise with Colts receivers like T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief.

“It’s been a great experience, being with a lot of guys that have been in the league a long time,” Smith said. “Being able not just to practice with them but train with them in the off-season.

“I would have done the same thing. I would have kept my doors open, take advantage of every opportunity I have to play football. It’s been a mixture of fun, a little bit frustrating. It was cool for the most part.”

Six months after legalisation, licensed producers are unable to keep up with the demand or quality of neighborhood dealers

When Melissa, a resident of Halifax, Nova Scotia, went to one of Canada’s first government cannabis stores, she wasn’t impressed. “You can’t look at what they have. You can’t smell the product,” she said. “It’s too expensive.”

And so she, like tens of thousand of other Canadians, went back to their old habits: buying from neighbourhood dealers.

Weed woes: Canada struggles to meet huge demand for legal cannabis Read more

Six months after Canada became the first G7 country to legalise marijuana, the bold experiment is still struggling to get off the ground.

Legal producers were unable to meet the sudden surge in demand, and struggled for weeks to fill orders, leaving marijuana stores with empty shelves.

As a result, the vast majority of cannabis sales in the country – roughly $5bn – are made on the illegal markets, compared to $2bn in legal sales, according to government figures from January 2019.

Ahead of legalization, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had argued that the move would nearly eliminate the black market, which he said funnelled money into organized crime.

But with so little cannabis to sell, licensed operators across the country have had to turn away potential customers, sending them instead to the black market.

“When I’m sold out, they’re still gonna find a product somewhere,” said Trevor Tobin, who operates the High North marijuana store in Labrador with his mother, Brenda.

Tobin said running a legal cannabis business has been an “ongoing struggle” in the face of persistent shortages. “It’s hard to keep employees behind the counter when they’re not selling any product – and we lose money every day that we don’t have product on the shelf.”

The Tobins are also competing against illegal “grey market” stores, which alongside marijuana sell edibles and hashish – items that licensed stores cannot yet offer.

A number of government outlets and licensed private stores have also faced complaints that their products do not match the quality of the black market.

“The product I got smelt like barn hay and was just as dry,” wrote one user on the site WeedMaps, reviewing Toronto’s first bricks-and-mortar locations, The Hunny Pot. “The only reason I’ll go back is to get a refund for this purchase.”

Melissa agreed: “I found it was really dry. And you feel like you’re getting less as a result. It kind of feels like you’re getting ripped off.” Even her friend, who works at a government store, gets his cannabis from an illegal supplier.

Canadians who purchase their cannabis from illegal sources also save a significant amount of money: the average price for a gram of illegal cannabis is 36% cheaper than its legal counterpart, Statistics Canada has found.

“As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,” said Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative thinktank. “The government was aware that it wouldn’t fully displace the black market on day one.” She and others suspect the black market will persist for at least another two years, as it did when Colorado legalised cannabis.

Canada is still grappling with how to treat people convicted under the country’s previous laws.

The government has promised to pardon 500,000 Canadians with minor cannabis convictions – but the current rules are still not enough, said Murray Rankin of the New Democratic party and member of the parliamentary justice committee.

Rankin has become a vocal advocate of expunging the records of those with convictions.

“The niceties of the human rights legislation may not be something you’re aware of,” he said. “Even if you were the victim of discrimination, tell me how many people are going to go to the human rights commission with their complaint and deal with it? Frankly not that many.”

Rankin also points to the uncomfortable reality of policing in Canada: visible minorities are over-represented in the number of minor cannabis convictions.

“The disproportionate impact on the hundreds of thousands of Canadians … is something that really should motivate us to not just do the half measure the government’s talked about, but fully expunge so people can get on with their lives,” he said.

Canada will begin the second stage of legalization – the sale of edibles and cannabis-infused drinks – in October.
Depending on whom you ask, the upcoming Florida Panthers season is about to be exciting for two wildly different reasons. If you have a normal brain and enjoy hockey, great — the Panthers just hired a new coach, Joel Quenneville, who has a long track record of success and piloted the Chicago Blackhawks to three Stanley Cup wins.

If you're a paranoid shut-in who follows the absolutely nuts QAnon conspiracy theory, then you're also in luck. Earlier this month, the Panthers made a bunch of posters and a literal billboard emblazoned with the sentence "Q IS HERE" — a reference to Quenneville — and some of the absolutely stupidest people on Earth now believe it's a reference to QAnon.

Because everything on the internet in 2019 is broken and depraved, a few prominent QAnon-following Twitter accounts posted photos of the billboard. The images are now cycling through the websites 8chan and Voat, two online cesspools of hate and racism:

There is a billboard in Florida celebrating the new Florida Panthers NHL team coach, Coach Quenneville. It states "Q is Here."



Some QAnon people think it's a reference to QAnon. Because their poor minds so hopelessly warped they see signs of their internet LARP everywhere. pic.twitter.com/fMhDZFlUYu — Travis View (@travis_view) April 14, 2019

A QAnon believer on Twitter claimed a billboard about a new coach for the Florida Panthers NHL team was about QAnon. A major QAnon Twitter account pushed the tweet and now QAnon believers on 8chan & voat are running with it. pic.twitter.com/ctUqDDMotZ — Alex Kaplan (@AlKapDC) April 15, 2019

For the uninitiated, QAnon is a batshit-crazy, pro-Trump conspiracy theorizing that prominent Democratic politicians, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, run an international child-rape coven, and that (accused sex predator) Donald Trump is working behind the scenes to arrest every member of the child-molesting Deep State. Like most bad things on the internet, the theory began on the website 4chan. A user named "Q Clearance Patriot" started claiming in 2017 he or she had inside access to the president, and people quickly began to believe Q was posting insider intelligence about President Trump.

Some QAnon fans literally believe Obama, Clinton, and others have secretly already been arrested and now walk the earth wearing ankle monitors as they await their international sex-crime charges. Other QAnon followers surmised George H.W. Bush's funeral was actually a fake setup to bring every major U.S. leader into a room so Trump could arrest them all. That obviously did not happen.

But QAnon is bleeding into all sorts of real-life events, and larger numbers of people keep turning up at Trump rallies wearing Q shirts or holding Q signs. More troublingly, a Broward Sheriff's Office SWAT officer, Matt Patten, wore a QAnon patch last November when BSO greeted Vice President Mike Pence at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

Quenneville, meanwhile, has gone by "Coach Q" for decades. Hockey analysts are quite optimistic about his new gig in Broward County — Quenneville's teams perennially make the playoffs. The Athletic, a sports-journalism web startup, wrote last week that Quenneville's hiring gave the Panthers "instant credibility."

Reached by phone, a spokesperson for the Florida Panthers declined to comment.
“Tilt Brush is designed for creators — whether you’re a casual doodler or a professional artist,” says Google Product Manager Elisabeth Morant. “Over time, we’ve seen the product used in ways we never would have imagined — from bringing our favorite Disney characters to life, to prototyping what became a Time Magazine’s best of 2018 invention, to 3D printing and casting a Tilt Brush self portrait as a bronze statue. The possibilities are endless, and we’ve only just scratched the surface.”

We sat down with Morant to learn more about Tilt Brush and the work it took to bring this impressive creative tool to an all-in-one VR system.

What was the initial inspiration behind Tilt Brush? How has it changed over the course of development?

Elisabeth Morant: From the very beginning, we found that Tilt Brush resonated with two core audiences. On the one hand, we had our creators, who were excited by the possibilities of creating art never before possible with this unique new medium. And on the other hand, we found over and over people (consumers and developers alike) told us that Tilt Brush was their very first introduction to VR — or at least, room-scale VR. It’s been important to us for the lifetime of development that we continue to build features that raise the skill ceiling of what’s possible for creators, while also making sure the product is easy to pick up and use for first timers.

Why did you decide to bring Tilt Brush to Quest?

EM: When we learned that Oculus was building a cord-free standalone headset, we knew we had to bring Tilt Brush to Quest. This new form factor will unlock completely new opportunities for our artists to create. We’ve already seen dancers adopt Tilt Brush to visualize their movements in VR, but the opportunity for fully free movement and creation will lead to art that we never could have dreamed up before.

How did you go about bringing Tilt Brush over from PC VR to a mobile chipset?

EM: Most of our work porting Tilt Brush to Quest focused on performance improvements. Luckily, some decisions we made early on set us up for early performance wins. For example, instead of recreating stroke meshes on the GPU for every frame, Tilt Brush strokes are converted from their internal control point representation into geometry only once: either when the user first creates the stroke, or when the sketch is loaded from disk. The GPU then just has to render a list of pre-generated triangles. Another early easy win for us was to switch over our stroke rendering from double-sided to single-sided, using the shader to draw the reverse side of the stroke, and instantly halving our triangle count.

We also had to make a few visual changes as well. For example, the PC version of Tilt Brush uses a full-screen pass to render selected objects, perform a blur on them followed by a threshold to create an outline effect. Doing a full-screen effect that would involve a read-back was not feasible on mobile. We tried various options to do outlining on strokes, and in the end we chose to go for a solution that looked completely different:
Hitting back at Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s ‘all Modis are thieves’ jibe, PM Modi said that he has been abused by the opposition many a time but this time Gandhi has branded the entire backward community as thieves.

Speaking at a rally in Maharashtra Modi said that several times Congress and its allies have targeted him for his humble background and caste and that he has endured such insults for many years but if someone tried to insult the chowkidars, the backward classes, the Dalits or Adivasis, he would not tolerate it.

Accusing Gandhi of calling the entire backward community thieves, the PM condemned the use of such language. “Should such language be used? We have to throw out such people. Abusive language has become the norm. The Sahu community here would have been called Modi in Gujarat. Are they all thieves?”, said PM at the rally.

The Congress dynast had attacked Prime Minister Modi by linking his surname with those of fugitive businessmen charged with corruption, Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi. “I have a question. Why do all the thieves have Modi in their names whether be it Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, and Narendra Modi? We don’t know how many more such Modis will come out,” said Gandhi.

Retaliating on Gandhi’s remarks, PM Modi said, “Recently the Namdar (a reference used by the PM for Gandhi) branded an entire community as thieves. He says everyone having Modi in his name is a thief. They abuse me because I am from a backward community. This is how they view people from backward castes.”

The Gandhi scion often makes such distasteful remarks about Prime Minister Modi which are some times based on his own imagination and are nowhere close to reality. Recently he had targeted veteran BJP leader L K Advani with his imagination saying that Advani was hit with a shoe and thrown out of the Party by the PM Minister after BJP National President Amit Shah was given the Lok Sabha ticket from Advani’s seat of Gandhinagar.

Supporters have discussed a new club-wide approach to equality and diversity and the possibility of education being built into the club’s sanctioning process at a fans forum which took place on April 3.

Attended by four members of club staff including Simon Thornton, diversity and inclusion manager, Susan Black, director of communications, and Lorna Duckworth, safeguarding and equality officer, the meeting lasted 90 minutes with contributions being made by forum members Paul Amann, Yunus Lunat and Steve Evans.

Red Together

Liverpool Football Club’s new approach to equality and diversity was presented by Simon Thornton who told the forum that the Red Together initiative would be “our focus from 2019-22” and that the basic premise was for it to allow supporters to work alongside the club and its workforce in delivering key objectives.

Outlining the strategy, Simon Thornton said it features a number of aims including:

The delivery of club-wide commitments to diversity and inclusion as part of our strategy

The modernisation of governance and risk processes building equality principles at every opportunity

Building an inclusive club culture

Working to improve our staff profile across a number of characteristics

Focusing on providing an inclusive fan experience

Engaging our supporters in promoting equality and role-model positive behaviour

Supporting a number of pro-equality campaigns throughout the year

Referring specifically to staff profiles, Yunus Lunat said that the document refers solely to gender when statistics would inform that race needs to be a priority given the profile of the club’s current workforce, which is not as representative as the city region in which Liverpool Football Club is based. Further, that Liverpool Football Club should seek to attract the best workforce from beyond the Liverpool region and, therefore, to rely upon the regional statistics is not a true comparison. The benchmark should be the national profiles.

Yunus Lunat added: “Sport claims to be inclusive but if it isn’t living up to that objective in its employment policies how can it stand up to scrutiny? Football’s understanding of racism has to be more than just trying to make sure that people do not suffer racist abuse when they go to matches. Bringing people into the game from different backgrounds has to be a big part of that and only when this happens will we start to see the kind of inclusivity that football clearly needs.”

In response, Simon Thornton said; “This is definitely part of our thinking. We need to look at what we can do to recruit more widely. Red Together will be central to all of this because it is a club-wide commitment to equality and diversity and it is about all aspects of the club so I can assure you that working to improve our staff profile in the coming years is a key objective.”

Paul Amann said: “I absolutely agree that you need a clear strategy, but in my view the club continues to miss a trick when it comes to being more inclusive and more representative. We are all aware of the effects that funding cuts have had on community and grassroots organisations, many of which are based in areas that the club should be doing more to reach out to, and this is something that you should definitely be looking at.

“A lot of those organisations would love to work with the club or simply be endorsed by them simply because of the power of the badge. This can happen on a very basic level via staff volunteering in local communities or it can be through partnerships but the basic principle is that the club needs a human interface and a regular presence. That would help people of various backgrounds feel that they have a connection with Liverpool Football Club beyond football and would also increase the sense that Liverpool is an organisation that they could work for.”

Susan Black replied: “Those points are really valid. If there is a feeling that people do not know how to get into LFC as an employee then it is incumbent on us all to work together to improve that sense of access. If we need to engage more directly then we absolutely can do that. This is something that we are already doing through Red Neighbours but at this stage that only applies to areas that are closest to Anfield, ie the L4, L5 and L6 postcodes. There is a lot of good work going on in this respect, career speed networking and Intu University being two prime examples, and this could easily work in other areas.”

Paul Amann added: “That would definitely be a start and it wouldn’t need to be in all areas initially, you have to run before you can walk obviously, so even if it was initially just rolled out into a couple of areas neighbouring the ones that it already happens in it would be a step in the right direction.”

Sanctioning and education

At the request of Yunus Lunat, and in light of a series of recent incidents, the club agreed to discuss the possibility of education being used as part of its sanctioning process in situations in which it may be deemed appropriate to do so.

Introducing the topic, Simon Thornton said: “Discriminatory behaviour appears to be on the rise and this is clearly a concern. The question I would like to pose in relation to this is how can we work with supporters to change things and ensure that the positive messaging about what this club and its supporters stand for is out there as much as possible? Also, in relation to Yunus’ question, would an educational element be appropriate when someone has acted discriminately?”

Yunus Lunat said: “It is becoming so toxic again, that is the reality. I don’t think it [racism] ever went away but people who are of that mindset clearly feel emboldened at the moment and this is reflected in some of the incidents that we have all seen. An initial idea for this football club would be to hold a day of inclusion which celebrates that we are one no matter what background we come from and which also serves to isolate those who do not share that mindset. It needs a big push – a game to focus on and focus minds.”

Paul Amann, Yunus Lunat and Steve Evans were all in agreement that education should be built into the sanctions process with Paul Amann commenting that “lessons will only be learned if there is some sort of educational element and restorative justice.”

Yunus Lunat added: “With a lot of sanctions processes it is a case of throw away the key and do not pass go. I am not suggesting there aren’t cases in which individuals deserve to be banned and indeed should be banned but sometimes you have to look at the behaviour and the person responsible for it and ask whether there is an opportunity for education and reform.

“In my opinion, one of the mandatory sanctions should be education either online or in person but in the case of a secondary offence a permanent ban has to be an option. It can’t just be about punishment, though, as that in isolation does not lead to a change in behaviour.”

With Spirit of Shankly (SOS) representative Phil Rowan unable to attend the forum due to work commitments, forum chair Tony Barrett confirmed that he had consulted with outgoing SOS chair James McKenna prior to the meeting. During that conversation, James McKenna confirmed that SOS would be supportive of education being added to the sanctions process.

Steve Evans said: “It has to be about education. For all of us, Liverpool Football Club is our lives and if any of us let ourselves down we should have the opportunity to prove it was a one off and that we can and will learn from it. But if it is a serious offence then the punishment has to be severe and, as Yunus said, the individual would have to be banned.”

Paul Amann said: “In terms of sanctions, a further issue that hasn’t been mentioned is consistency. The lack of consistency with which instances of racism are dealt with in comparison with instances of homophobia is something that needs to be addressed. There have been examples in which racism has been, quite rightly, dealt with severely but the same has not been the case when it comes to homophobia. There needs to be a level playing field for sanctions.

“But in relation to education and rehabilitation, I would add that if someone does go through that kind of process it would be up to the club to track their behaviour if and when they returned to the ground. I know this might be perceived as a bit ‘Big Brother’ but it is a fair response to the kind of behaviour that we are discussing as the one thing that would not be acceptable would be for it to be repeated unchecked.

“Also, a further caveat should be that if anyone who is found to have committed any kind of discriminatory behaviour is also found to be a member of a proscribed political organisation I would have no hesitation in saying they should be banned for life.”

Forum chair Tony Barrett said: “This was a very forthright forum in which supporters underlined their support for the club’s equality and diversity strategy but also called for heightened activity in this area, particularly in terms of engaging communities and addressing some of the staff profile challenges that the club is facing. There was also unanimous support for the idea of introducing an educational element into the sanctions process which will now be discussed by club officials.”
As per recent reports coming from West Virginia, the state is said to be considering using a blockchain voting system for the upcoming presidential elections in 2020.

Donald Kersey, the state’s election director reported that the operation will pick up from where it left off back in mid 2018. However, it must be noted that the state is the U.S. state to have officially made use of blockchain technology for voting.

This groundbreaking voting system will first be introduced and aimed at citizens living abroad as well as those serving in the military as these demographics make for low voting turnouts. Currently, only 7% of overseas voters made to it to the polls during the 2016 presidential elections as per data from the Federal Voting Assistance program. In comparison to this, U.S. citizens nationwide had a decent turn out rate of around 72%.

The possibility of casting a vote via a smartphone was something that was pretty much unheard of a few years ago before the world was introduced to “Decentralisation”. The introduction of a blockchain-based system could make the process of voting less laborious, quick, simple and easy without any possibility of compromising integrity.

During the pilot phase back in 2016, the office of West Virginian Secretary of State worked with a platform which was developed by Voatz, a startup devoted to the development of blockchain voting.

A test was conducted which allowed users to download the Voatz app on their smartphones, while verifying their identity and selecting their country of residence. The test was an undeniable success and meant Voatz retained their contract for the upcoming elections in 2020.

There were apparently as many as 340 overseas voters who tried to make use of the blockchain system in 2016, but many found issues trying to use the app for voting due to the country of residence not allowing it to happen.

Blockchain Governance.

Much criticism was garnered from the test phase in particular surrounding questions about the role played by Voatz with many questioning the possibility of Voatz suffering a hack and whether the app could see who voted.

Others questions whether smartphones could be stolen or hacked in order to commit unauthorised voting by malicious individuals.

A solid understanding of the Blockchain 3.0 Governance systems shows that these nodes on the blockchain are not run by Voatz. The platform is not reliant on regular computing systems which owned by members of the public. Instead the test is carried out by 32 servers which belong to cloud infrastructure companies such as AWS or Microsoft’s Azure.

Donald Kersey added to this:

“We are not saying that blockchain technology is the best solution to storage of secure data. But what we are saying though is that it’s better than what we currently have.”

Anonymity is one the core features of voting and this is a shared aspect and a strong point found within the implementation of blockchain. Votes leave the caster as soon as it enters the blockchain data structure. Voters can still receive records of their votes and can be a anonymously copied to any email or document format with their ballot attached to it.
Mental-health challenges are not unique to competitive student athletes like Isabella, of course: Nearly half of American youths struggle with a mental illness before turning 18, while 12 percent have experienced a bout of depression. But even though playing sports on a regular basis can boost physical and mental health, for some serious high-school athletes—many who train year-round and might need an athletic scholarship to afford college tuition—sports can be a key contributor to depression and anxiety.

“The professional consensus is that the incidence of anxiety and depression among scholastic athletes has increased over the past 10 to 15 years,” says Marshall Mintz, a New Jersey–based sports psychologist who has worked with teenagers for 30 years. As one 2015 study by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association found, “Many student-athletes report higher levels of negative emotional states than non-student-athlete adolescents.” Though parents and coaches are often best positioned to remedy the problem, they also often make it worse.

One reason for this trend is that high-school sports have begun to copy the training methods and intensity levels of college sports. This “sports professionalization” says Timothy Neal, a professor of health and human performance at Concordia University Ann Arbor, is a trickle-down effect of big-time sports, from professional to college and now to high school. More students are specializing in only one sport and playing it beyond one season, sometimes competing on multiple teams throughout the year. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons found in 2017 that high-school, college, and professional athletes trained in a single sport for a comparable number of months each year. As “intensive parenting” has become the norm, parents in recent decades have pressed upon their kids the idea that endless practice is the route to athletic mastery. Private clubs and teams, which need income year-round to stay in business, have also urged this devotion to one sport.

This professionalization has led to overtraining and exhaustion, which is central to the mental-health problems of competitive high-school athletes. “The biggest problem is sleep loss—all these kids are sleep-deprived,” Mintz says, “and this becomes a major contributor to anxiety and depression.” Long practices and multiple daily workouts mean that athletes have less time than before for other activities, which can amplify the pressures of high school. “Do they need two and a half to three hours of practice?” asks Lonnie Sarnell, a sports psychologist in Millburn, New Jersey, who works with high-school athletes. “That extra hour of practice adds so much stress when you have four hours of homework to deal with.”

Read: The case against high-school sports

All that extra time practicing makes players more vulnerable to injuries, which can be another emotional challenge, especially for those whose identity is closely tied to the sport they play. Some athletes who drop other interests and activities to focus on a sport, and whose self-worth is linked to their performance, can feel lost when they’re sidelined; it’s the rudderless feeling Isabella experienced after tearing her ACL. On top of these strains, teenage athletes have to contend with ordinary frictions that come with being on a team—worries over playing time, making mistakes, and working with difficult coaches. These challenges are only more fraught for players with grand athletic goals.
Police have shut down the public's access to wifi on the London Underground in an attempt to disrupt planned protests by climate protesters.

The blocking of the Tube's internet access, which was not made public before being implemented, comes amid a takeover since Monday of some of London's busiest streets by Extinction Rebellion, an environmental group attempting to force adequate government action over runaway climate change.

“In the interests of safety and to prevent and deter serious disruption to the London Underground network, British Transport Police (BTP) has taken the decision to restrict passenger WiFi connectivity at Tube stations," British Transport Police told The Independent.

We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.

"This follows intelligence that Extinction Rebellion protesters intend to cause disruption to Tube services."

A spokesperson added: “We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and we would like to assure passengers that this decision is not taken lightly."

Police say the group have caused "serious disruption" affecting half a million people in the capital over the past two days. Almost 300 activists have been arrested amid protests in Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Waterloo Bridge and Piccadilly Circus.

But XR say they are planning to disrupt Tube services on Wednesday after the government failed to meet its members to discuss their demands.

"XR will nonviolently disrupt Tube services to highlight the emergency of ecological collapse," XR said in a statement. "We sincerely apologise to all those who may suffer as a consequence of this disruption. In any other circumstances we would never dream of disrupting the Tube but this is an emergency."

A Transport for London (TfL) spokesperson said: “We’re working closely with the police to manage the impact of disruption to London’s transport network. Customer WiFi in Underground stations has been temporarily switched off after a request from British Transport Police. We will restore access as soon as we are able to do so.”

TfL and BTP's decision was criticised by privacy watchdog Big Brother Watch as "disproportionate" and "deeply authoritarian".

"Shutting down digital infrastructure in response to a peaceful protest is deeply authoritarian," said Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch.

"While the police and transport networks have a duty to keep everyone safe, indiscriminately restricting everyone's ability to access wifi and communicate on the underground is disproportionate and the kind of action that's usually only taken in response to terror attacks.

"The authorities should not be using draconian powers to suppress people's right to peaceful protest."

In the face of climate breakdown – scientists have warned we have 12 years to stop catastrophic global warming – XR has three demands.

It is demanding the UK government declare a climate and ecological emergency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, and create a so-called citizens’ assembly made up of members of the public, which would lead decision-making in the fight against climate and ecological breakdown

XR said there were set to be protests in at least 80 cities in more than 33 countries.
Albon was required to make a pitlane start after a huge crash on Saturday morning forced the team to build up the spare chassis.

Rather than go for a conservative strategy and long opening stint, STR gave Albon a set of new soft tyres for the start.

He managed to do 19 laps before switching to the hard tyre for the run to the flag, subsequently staying ahead of drivers who stopped twice.

It was his second consecutive top-10 finish, and earned him the ‘Driver of the Day’ award, voted on by F1 fans.

“Alex did another fantastic race, and scored a point for a second time,” Tost told Motorsport.com. “I’m really happy with his performance and how he drove this race. It was a perfect race, without any incidents, and also his overtaking manoeuvres during the race were very good.

“It was a well-deserved point because from Friday onwards he showed a good performance with the car. He was very fast on Saturday in FP3 and then unfortunately he came off the track.”

Tost said there was no point in Albon waiting for the race to come to him from a pitlane start.

“I said to him, 'be very aggressive'. Starting from the pitlane, what do you want to do? The strategy was to start with the soft tyre, to be aggressive, and to overtake.

“We had two possibilities from the strategy side. Originally we planned a two-stop strategy with him, but the soft tyre worked quite well, and therefore we changed to a one stop.

“Of course we had a lot of work to build up the car, because the monocoque was damaged we had to change everything. So it’s also a good point for the team, for the mechanics, because they worked very hard to prepare everything in the best possible way.

Along with a new chassis and gearbox, Albon took a fresh power unit for the race, without any extra penalty, as he was already in the pitlane. Honda has sent the PU from the crash back to Japan for analysis, along with the engine that came out of Daniil Kvyat’s car on Friday after the Russian had some issues.

It’s not yet known if any elements will be returned to the pool for future use. “We will see, this is a decision from Honda," said Tost. "Both engines have gone back to Sakura, and we will wait for news.”

Tost is confident that there is more to come from the STR14, especially in qualifying.

“I think we have a competitive package. We were in the points in all three races, and we get it together in qualifying we can be in better positions than ninth and 10th.

“The potential from the car is clear, the drivers are doing a very good job, the team is improving, and therefore I expect we will score more points on the next few races.”
Lawsuit could benefit 46 million people even if they have never owned the credit card

Almost every adult in the UK could receive a payout of up to £300 from Mastercard after a court ruling paved the way for a £14bn class action lawsuit.

The legal action taken by former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks claims that 46 million UK consumers paid higher prices in shops over a 16-year period because of allegedly excessive transaction fees charged by Mastercard.

Two years ago, the Competition Appeal Tribunal threw out Merricks’s claim, ruling it would not grant an order for the case to continue to trial. In a dramatic turnaround, the court of appeal has ordered the tribunal to reconsider what has become the biggest class action in British legal history.

Merricks said he was confident the tribunal will certify the action, enabling it to go to court and result in a multibillion-pound payout, if successful.

“I am very pleased with today’s decision,” said Merricks. “It is nearly 12 years since Mastercard was clearly told that they had broken the law by imposing excessive card transaction charges, damaging consumers over a prolonged period.

“When challenged, all they have done is to raise technical legal arguments that turn out to have no merit – as the court of appeal has shown today. It’s now time for Mastercard to admit the damage they did, to apologise to the British public, and to agree to pay the compensation they owe.”

Mastercard said it will fight the case all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. It said in a statement: “This decision is not a final ruling and the proposed claim is not approved to move forward, rather the court has simply said a re-hearing on certain issues should happen.

“Mastercard continues to disagree fundamentally with the basis of the claim and we believe UK consumers receive real value from the security, convenience and consumer protection of our payment services.”

The tribunal originally rejected Merricks’s claim partly because it could not find clear evidence about how the Mastercard fees had been passed on to consumers – or absorbed by retailers – and how individual losses could be calculated. But the court of appeal found that was not a basis for rejecting certification for a court action.

Merricks said the maximum payout would be about £300 for anyone who can prove they were in the UK in the 16 years between 1992 and 2008.

In total, Merricks said 46 million adults could qualify and they need never have held a Mastercard. His case rests on the fact that higher prices would have been paid by all consumers during the period.

The case is the first major test of a regime introduced under the Consumer Rights Act for people to recover losses from competition law infringements.

Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out, with the Competition Appeal Tribunal nominated to oversee such class action lawsuits.

Lawyers acting for Merricks hailed the ruling as a landmark judgment. Boris Bronfentrinker of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan said: “The court of appeal’s judgment marks a significant day for the collective action regime in this country, after a number of false starts before the Competition Appeal Tribunal.”

The case also represents a potential bonanza for new-style litigation funds that pay for class actions to be mounted.

Merricks’s action was initially financed by Chicago-based litigation funder Gerchen Keller Capital, which the Law Society Gazette said would make whatever was the greater of £135m or 30% of the proceeds of the case up to £1bn, plus 20% of the proceeds over £1bn.

A new funder, Innsworth Litigation Funding, has taken on the case. It is understood it will receive a share of whatever is left if not every person in the class action lawsuit makes a claim.

Merricks said he does not personally stand to make a cut from any court award. “I am paid an hourly rate of £150 for the time I have spent on this,” he said.

Viagra Ne Kadar Sürede Etki Eder?

Yapılan araştırmalara ve anketlere göre, Viagra'nın etki süresi, bünyenize ve öncesinde yaptıklarınıza göre, 30 ile 60 dakika arasında değişmekte. Bir tablet Viagra'yı, ilişkiden yarım saat ile kırkbeş dakika öncesinde almanızda fayda var. Viagra'nın etki etme süresi üzerinde, yemek, alkol ve cinsel tahrik gibi etmenlerin de payı bulunuyor.

Yemek: Viagra kullanmadan önce yemek yemeniz halinde, Viagra'nın bünyenizde etki etmesi daha geç olacaktır. Normal şartlarda yarım saatte etki edecek olan ilaç, yediğiniz yemeğe bağlı olarak daha uzun sürede ereksiyon desteği sağlayabilir. Viagra, ideal olarak aç karna kullanılmalı. Ancak ilişki öncesinde yemek yemek istiyorsanız, hafif ve daha az yağlı yemekleri tercih etmenizde fayda var. Viagra'yı, yemekten 2 saat sonra kullanmanız halinde, etkilerini tam olarak görebilirsiniz.

Alkol: Alkol kullanımı Viagra'nın etki süresi ile direk olarak bağlantılı. Viagra, kısa sürede etki eden bir ilaç olsa da, alkol tükettiğiniz anlarda etki süresi oldukça uzamakta. Normal şartlarda yarım saat olan süre, vücudunuzdaki alkol miktarına bağlı olarak uzayabiliyor. Hatta bazı durumlarda, alkol kullanımı Viagra'nın tüm etkisini yok edebilir. 2 biradan fazla alkol tüketimi tavsiye edilmemekte.
Financial sector warned it risks losses from extreme weather and its stakes in polluting firms

The global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform, the governors of the Bank of England and France’s central bank have warned, writing in the Guardian.

In an article published in the Guardian on Wednesday aimed at the international financial community, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, said financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world had to “raise the bar” to avoid catastrophe.

They said: “As financial policymakers and prudential supervisors we cannot ignore the obvious physical risks before our eyes. Climate change is a global problem, which requires global solutions, in which the whole financial sector has a central role to play.”

The warning comes as concern over the impact of climate change and the lack of urgent action is increasing, reflected in the Extinction Rebellion protests and schoolchildren’s strikes across the world.

The heads of two of the world’s most influential central banks urged other financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, while also calling for more collaboration between nations on the issue. They warned that a “massive reallocation of capital” was necessary to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement, with the banking system required to play a pivotal role.

“If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” Carney and De Galhau said.

Climate change poses significant risks to banks and insurers from rising instances of catastrophic weather-related events, such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, which could land them with significant losses.

There are also risks for financial firms as governments accept the need to tackle climate change because banks that have lent to companies reliant on burning fossil fuels run the risk of steep financial losses.

Carney has previously warned that plunging sales of diesel cars, due to new vehicle emissions tests and changes in the tax system, which have had knock-on effects for manufacturers and the wider economy, are an example of this in action.

Banks could find they have stranded assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not effectively addressed.

The open letter from Carney and De Galhau accompanies the launch of a report from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), an international group of central banks and financial regulators, outlining the steps necessary for financiers to tackle climate change.

Global warming has typically been of secondary concern to central bankers since the 2008 financial crisis, as they grappled with the immediate threat of banking failures. However, there is growing recognition that action is needed to fight the risks it poses.

Although they have received praise for advancing the debate about climate change, Carney, central bankers and financiers have been criticised for expecting the banking industry to reform itself without tougher regulation being introduced.

Frank van Lerven, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “Central banks across the world, and in the UK, have done a very good job of identifying the problem. The question is whether they have the right balance between being thought leaders on this issue and identifying problems and taking action.”
“I know what it’s like to be hungry or to see your mom struggling. Everyone in my neighborhood was always outside playing because their parents were working. And they weren’t at home waiting for the government to save them,” the mayor said. “I think I have a special responsibility to elevate policy and solutions that can deal with these issues, but also to change these caricatures we have of people who are no different than anyone else. Who happen to work in jobs that don’t pay well.”

Following a lockout at Columbine High School and other Denver area schools, authorities say they are looking for a woman suspected of making threats. David Zalubowski/AP Photo

Update 11:46 a.m. Wednesday, April 17: The woman sought in connection to threats made to Denver-area schools has been found dead. The FBI says the community threat is over. You can find the latest updates on this developing story here. Our original story from Tuesday continues below.

--

Denver metro-area schools are closing Wednesday as the FBI searched for a young woman suspected of making threats, authorities said.

The following districts announced closures late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning:

The FBI and Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said Sol Pais, an 18-year-old white woman, traveled to Colorado on Monday night and made threats against schools. Pais traveled to Colorado by air from Miami, Denver FBI Chief Dean Phillips said. She then bought a pump-action shotgun "immediately" upon arriving in Colorado.

In a Tuesday night press conference, Phillips said Pais expressed an "infatuation with Columbine" and the two teenage gunmen who perpetuated the shooting in past comments.

There is no information about any specific threat to any particular school, but authorities believe she is a credible threat to the community.

"This has become a massive manhunt," Phillips said.

Officials had no answer at the time of the press conference as to whether schools would open on Wednesday. The situation was described as "dynamic" and "could change rapidly" throughout the evening,

"I don't have that answer for you tonight," said Stan Hilkey, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. "But we do intend to make sure we are engaged with school superintendents and specifically with the Jefferson County School District and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and others and with our law enforcement partners to make the very best decision."

Pais was last seen in the Jefferson County foothills and is considered extremely dangerous. Officials requested any witnesses or people with information should contact the FBI tipline at 303-630-6227 by phone, or denverfbitips@fbi.gov by email.

The @FBIDenver & JCSO are asking for the public’s help regarding a potential credible threat. Last night Sol Pais traveled to Colorado & made threats. She is armed & considered to be extremely dangerous 1/3 pic.twitter.com/2x5iwddsMp — Jeffco Sheriff (@jeffcosheriffco) April 16, 2019

Complicating the case is the fact Pais has not technically committed a crime. The FBI is working with the U.S. Attorney's Office, and local law enforcement with local district attorneys' offices, to develop charges. Phillips said that would not prevent authorities from apprehending Pais.

"If we found her tonight, we will certainly hold her for as long as we can legally," Phillips said.

The timing of Pais' threats held significance for authorities.

"It's certainly not the first threat that we've had that involves Columbine High School, or references it. And in that regard, I know that this opens a wound, especially on this anniversary week, for those families who were most deeply impacted by this," Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader said.

The lockouts come just days before the 20th anniversary of a mass shooting at the school that killed 12 students and a teacher. There was no immediate indication whether there was any connection to the anniversary.

The Colorado Department of Education encouraged schools in the metro area to go into a lockout and run a controlled release of students at dismissal.

The department's announcement came after the same threat lead to an earlier lockout of several Jefferson County schools, including Columbine High School.

Gov. Jared Polis says the threat that prompted a lockdown at Columbine High School and other Denver-area schools involved someone who was armed and "may be interested in harming our schools or our kids."

Polis said Tuesday the Colorado Department of Public Safety was working with the FBI to protect public safety.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

Quick Take Kraken will cease trading on BSV pairs on April 29, withdrawals by May 31

Starting in May, the exchange aims to list two coins a month through 2019

U.S. crypto exchange Kraken announced Tuesday it will cease trading of a controversial bitcoin cash offshoot, Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision, following consultation with Kraken users and a supportive Twitter poll that saw more than 50,000 users vote to delist the asset.

According to the firm, BSV deposits will be disabled by April 22, with users able to withdraw BSV through the end of May.

Bitcoin SV is the result of a chain split of the Bitcoin Cash network in November. The cryptocurrency has been mired in controversy due to its supporters Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, who have threatened various members of the community with lawsuits over public claims that Wright is not Satoshi Nakomoto.

“Over the last few months, the team behind Bitcoin SV have engaged in behaviour completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for. It started with fraudulent claims, escalating to threats and legal action, with the BSV team suing a number of people speaking out against them,” according to the post.

Kraken CEO Jesse Powell admitted the exchange wasn’t a “big fan of the project” when it was toying with the idea of listing it, but decided to support trading, citing customer demand. “With forks, you have people who are upset when you don’t give users ‘free money.'” Powell noted, however, that the coin didn’t necessarily meet its listing standards.

Kraken’s move follows Binance’s decision yesterday to delist BSV on April 22, following warnings from CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao that he would delist the token should Wright fail to cease claiming to be Satoshi

As for Kraken, Powell said the firm has received lawsuits from the Bitcoin SV camp, which extended to its investors and clients. “We were going to put out the poll regardless of CZ’s announcement, but Binance and ShapeShift’s stance made our position even stronger.”

“There’s a business cost to these decisions, but we felt that sacrificing revenue is worth it.”

Powell said his firm will continue to scrutinize other tokens, but unless public sentiment shifts heavily against a specific token he’s hopeful they won’t see any other delisting cases.

“In this case, it is a unique case for us, we haven’t delisted any other coins because the founders, people who are promoting it, turned out to be total assholes.”

Looking ahead, Powell said Kraken sees volatility and the price of Bitcoin back above $5,000 as positives in the market. He also hinted the pace of listing new coins on the exchange would pick up in the coming months.

“We want to be fairly scrutinizing of the coins we list, but we have a backlog of coins we want to list – client demand is a big piece of it. We have a few coins not widely known but [which] are technically interesting,” he said.

The firm will probably list two coins a month starting in May, Powell said.

- The city of Oakland is pitching in to save schools’ restorative justice programs and foster care managers, as well as restore library services, which were slashed from next year’s Oakland Unified budget.

On Tuesday, the Oakland City Council voted to use real estate transfer tax revenue to give the school district a $1.2 million grant to pay for these educators, who are charged with helping students resolve conflicts and figure out positive alternatives to discipline.

These employees, along with foster care managers and library techs, are among hundreds who may get layoff notices by April 30 if the district can’t find another way to pay for them.

The day after a seven-day teacher strike ended, Oakland Unified’s school board voted to slash around $22 million from the budget for the 2019-20 school year. The budget cuts were made in order for the district to remain fiscally solvent and to fund teachers’ raises agreed to in the contract that was settled after the strike, district officials have said.

The lack of guaranteed funding for the Oakland Unified School District is why Kaplan and council members Nikki Fortunato Bass, Noel Gallo and Sheng Thao proposed giving the one-time grant, as they seek to find longer term solutions to their fiscal woes.

The money will come from excess real estate transfer tax revenue: $800,000 of it will go to funding the restorative justice programs and $400,000 will go toward libraries and the foster youth case management according to the resolution. Kaplan's chief of staff Julie Wedge told KTVU that the specific breakdown of what schools will get the money will be provided at a future meeting of the Education Partnership Committtee.

Although schools get their funding from the state and have their own governing boards that determine how that funding is allocated, Kaplan told the East Bay Times that having programs like restorative justice is a matter of violence prevention, which is an issue that city government is concerned with.

The spouse of an American soldier killed in action in Afghanistan was arrested by ICE on the way to his job and deported last week despite being the father of a 12-year-old daughter who is an American citizen, the Arizona Republic reported Monday. The story is as horrific as it is familiar under the Trump administration, and the reported details are a reminder of the arbitrary and callous administration of the country’s immigration laws.

Jose Gonzalez Carranza, now 30, came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. He later married Army Pfc. Barbara Vieyra and had a daughter Evelyn . Vieyra was 22 years old when she was killed in 2010 while serving in the Army in Afghanistan. After her death, Gonzalez was granted what’s called parole in place, allowing him to stay in the country. Given his protected status, and lack of a criminal record, a judge later ended deportation proceedings against Gonzalez.

In 2018, however, the Trump administration reopened the case and ordered a court hearing. But Gonzalez didn’t show for the court date because, he says, he never got the notice that ICE sent to the wrong address. The missed court appearance prompted a judge, in December, to order Gonzalez to be deported, but again he didn’t receive news of the order to dispute or correct it until ICE showed up at his door last Monday. By then it was too late and two days later Gonzalez was deported to Nogales, Mexico and living in a shelter for deported migrants. “I feel so bad,” Gonzalez said of being taken away from his daughter. “I’m thinking about, I might never see her again.”

Making matters worse, his lawyer said Gonzalez filed a motion to reopen the deportation case after his arrest, which should have meant an automatic stay to his deportation proceeding. But ICE deported him anyway. “After speaking to The Arizona Republic, [the lawyer] said he received a call from an ICE officer who told him the agency was making arrangements to allow Gonzalez back into the U.S.,” the paper reported.
Other World Computing (OWC) has launched a new line of NVMe SSD upgrades for several Mac models that used Apple's custom not-quite-M.2 form factor. The new Aura Pro X2 is OWC's third generation aftermarket storage upgrade for Apple's custom SSD form factor.

Apple was an early adopter of PCIe SSDs in the consumer space, introducing them to several models in 2013. In recent years they have phased out the use of replaceable SSDs in favor of using their own SSD controller built in to the T2 security chip, but there is still a large install base of pre-TouchBar MacBook Pros and non-Retina MacBook Airs that can accept storage upgrades. Aftermarket upgrade options for these machines were initially very limited until macOS 10.13 added NVMe support, which allowed off the shelf M.2 NVMe drives to be used with a passive adapter—however, those adapters are a bit too thick for Apple's notebooks (they fit just fine in the cylinder Mac Pro).

Before macOS supported NVMe, OWC provided the Aura SSD, which was essentially two SATA SSDs in RAID-0 behind a Marvell controller that only supported a PCIe 2.0 x2 host interface. The Aura's performance was poor, but it did offer the option of upgrading storage capacity, which was particularly useful for the MacBook Air models that never offered a factory 1TB SSD option. The Aura was followed up by the Aura Pro X based on the Silicon Motion SM2260 controller, which meant OWC was still struggling to offer better performance than the Samsung and SanDisk drives Apple shipped. The new Aura Pro X2 uses the Silicon Motion SM2262EN and offers performance and power efficiency on par with current high-end SSDs in standard M.2 form factors, and includes the first 2TB SSD in Apple's form factor.

OWC sells the Aura Pro X2 as either a standalone drive or in an upgrade kit that includes their Envoy Pro USB enclosure for the stock SSDs the Aura Pro X2 replaces, and the necessary pentalobe and Torx screwdrivers to perform the upgrade. The upgrade kit is $70-80 more expensive than the bare drive.

Prices for the Aura Pro X2 are quite steep compared to retail M.2 NVMe SSDs—they're more like what the MLC-based Samsung 970 PRO sells for, rather than in line with other TLC-based NVMe SSDs.

We have a review sample of the 960GB Aura Pro X2 on hand. It has already completed most of our usual consumer SSD test suite and those results are available in our Bench database, but for the full review we'll also be doing some macOS testing.
San Francisco is on the verge of enacting a unique congestion charge.

A bill introduced in the California legislature would allow the city to charge drivers to take a trip down Lombard Street, a famous windy red brick-paved block billed as “The Crookedest Street in the World.”

The steep, single-lane street is built on a 27 percent grade and features eight hairpin turns along its length. The bill’s sponsor, State Assemblyman Phil Ting, said traffic in the area is a problem and that he believes that both residents and visitors will benefit.

NEW YORK CITY BANS CARS FROM CENTRAL PARK

"The cars really impact the neighborhood because they line up, they back up, they are sitting idling," said Greg Brundage, president of the Lombard Hill Improvement Association.

Brundage told KTVU that he thinks most of the association’s members support the legislation.

A pilot program is being proposed that would require drivers to make timed reservations, similar to a system used at some nearby attractions, including Muir Woods. The fee is likely to be set at $5 on weekdays and $10 on weekends and holidays.

The bill’s supporters say they expect little or no opposition to its passage and are hoping to launch next year with either a staffed or electronic system to monitor entry.

Along with cars, an estimated 6,000 pedestrians visit the street each day, and Brundage said he’d also like to see something done about the buses that drop tourists off at the top of the hill.

Although Lombard is recognized by Guinness World Records as the “Most Crooked Road,” there are those who say the title should belong to San Francisco’s Vermont Street, which has a reportedly higher “sinuosity” rating along its seven turns, but isn't as much of a draw thanks in part to its obstructed views.

The doglike robots from Boston Dynamics are back with another video, but this time the video is less about virality and more focused on demonstrating the machines' raw power.

Behold, 10 robot dogs pulling a large truck:

Pretty intense, no?

Don't get too worried — these little guys aren't coming to pull your house away anytime soon.

According to Boston Dynamics, the 10 "SpotMini" robot dogs were able to pull the Boston Dynamics truck "~1 degree uphill, truck in neutral." That's still quite a bit of pulling power from less than a dozen robot dogs, but they're still a few degrees removed from robot-apocalypse territory.

Admittedly, images like these don't help:

Developmental psychology never struck my interest in the same way as a lot of other kinds of psychology. It didn’t seem to give me insight into my own life, help me understand my friends, or explain weird things about society.

I’ve changed my mind about all of that after reading David Chapman’s Developing Ethical, Social, and Cognitive Competence.

First, a refresher. Developmental psychology describes how children go from helpless infants to reasonable adults. Although a lot of it has to do with sensorimotor skills like walking and talking, the really interesting stuff is cognitive development. Children start off as very buggy reasoners incapable of all but the most superficial forms of logic but gradually go on to develop new abilities and insights that allow them to navigate adult life.

Maybe the most famous of these is “theory of mind”, the ability to view things from other people’s perspective. In a classic demonstration, researchers show little Amy a Skittles bag and ask what she thinks is inside. She guesses Skittles, but the researchers open it and reveal it’s actually pennies. Then they close it up and invite little Brayden into the room. Then they ask Amy what Brayden thinks is inside. If Amy’s three years old or younger, she’ll usually say “pennies” – she knows that pennies are inside, so why shouldn’t Brayden know too? If she’s four or older, she’ll usually say “Skittles” – she realizes on a gut level that she and Brayden are separate minds and that Brayden will have his own perspective. Sometimes the same mistake can extend to preferences and beliefs. Wikipedia gives the example of a child saying “I like Sesame Street, so Daddy must like Sesame Street too.” This is another theory of mind failure grounded in an inability to separate self and environment.

Here’s another example which tentatively sounds like a self-environment failure. Young children really don’t get foreign languages. I got a little of this teaching English in Japan, and heard more of it from other people. The really young kids treated English like a cipher; everybody started out knowing things’ real (ie Japanese) names, but Americans insisted on converting them into their own special American-person code before talking about them. Kids would ask weird things like whether American parents would make an exception and speak Japanese to their kids who were too young to have learned English yet, or whether it was a zero-tolerance policy sort of thing and the families would just not communicate until the kids went to English school. And I made fun of them, but I also remember the first time I visited Paris I heard somebody talking to their dog, and for a split second I was like “Why would you expect your dog to know French?” before my brain kicked in and I was like “Duuhhhh….”

The infamous “magical thinking” which kids display until age 7 or so also involves confused self-environment boundaries. Maybe little Amy gets mad at Brayden and shouts “I HATE HIM” to her mother. The next day, Brayden falls off a step and skins his knee. Amy intuits a cause-and-effect relationship between her hatred and Brayden’s accident and feels guilty. She doesn’t realize that her hatred is internal to herself and can’t affect the world directly. Or kids displaying animism at this age, and expecting that the TV doesn’t work because it’s angry, or the car’s not starting because it’s tired.

Psychology textbooks never discuss whether this progression in and out of developmental stages is innate or environmental, which is weird because psychology textbooks usually love that sort of thing. I always assumed it was innate, because it was on the same timeline as things like walking and talking which are definitely innate. But I’ve been moved to question that after reading some of the work comparing “primitive” cultures to primitive developmental stages.

This probably isn’t the most politically correct thing to do, but it’s notable enough that anthropologists have been thinking about it for centuries. For example, from Ethnicity, Nationality, and Religious Experience :

Primitive people are generally as intelligent as the people of any culture, including the contemporary industrial-electronic age cultures. that makes it all the more significant that their publicly shared cognitive style shows little identifiable formal operational thought. The probable explanation for this, if true, is simply that formal operational thought is more complexly difficult than earlier modes of thought and will be used in a culture in a publicly shared way only if that culture has developed techniques for training people in its use. Primitive cultures do not do that, and thus by default use easier styles of thought, ones closer in form to concrete oeprational and even pre-operational thought, as defined by Piaget.

Primitive cultures certainly exhibit the magical thinking typical of young children; this is the origin of a whole host of superstitions and witch-doctory. They exhibit the same animism; there are hundreds of different animistic religions worldwide. And although I didn’t talk much about theories of moral development, primitive cultures’ notion of taboo is pretty similar to Kohlberg’s conventional stage.

But if different cultures progress through developmental milestones at different rates or not at all, then these aren’t universal laws of child development but facts about what skills get learned slowly or quickly in different cultures. In this model, development is not a matter of certain innate abilities like walking “unfolding” at the right time, but about difficult mental operations that you either learn or you don’t depending on how hard the world is trying to cram them into your head.

So getting back to David Chapman: his post is mostly about Robert Kegan’s account of “stages of moral development”. I didn’t get much from Kegan himself, but I was fascinated by an idea just sort of dropped into the middle of the discussion: that less than half of the people in modern western countries had attained Kegan’s fourth stage, and only a small handful attained his fifth. This was a way of thinking about development that I’d never heard before.

On the other hand, it makes sense. Take General Semantics (please!). I remember reading through Korzybski’s giant blue book of General Semantics , full of labyrinthine diagrams and promises that if only you understood this, you would engage with the world totally differently, you’d be a new man armed with invincible cognitive weapons. And the key insight, maybe the only insight, was “the map is not the territory”, which seems utterly banal.

But this is a self-environment distinction of exactly the sort that children learn in development. It’s dividing your own representation of the world from the world itself; it’s about as clear a reference to theory of mind as you could ask for. Korzybski considered it a revelation when he discovered it; thousands of other people found it helpful and started a movement around it; I conclude that these people were missing a piece of theory-of-mind and Korzybski gave it to them. Not the whole deal, of course. Just a piece. But a piece of something big and fundamental, so abstract and difficult to teach that it required that whole nine-hundred-something page book to cram it in.

And now I’m looking for other things in the discourse that sound like developmental milestones, and there are oodles of them.

I remember reading this piece by Nathan Robinson, where he compares his own liberal principles saying that colleges shouldn’t endorse war-violence-glorifying film “American Sniper” to some conservatives arguing that colleges shouldn’t endorse homosexuality-glorifying book “Fun Home”:

It is hypocrisy for liberals to laugh at and criticize the Duke students who have objected to their summer reading book due to its sexual and homosexual themes. They didn’t seem to react similarly when students at other universities tried to get screenings of American Sniper cancelled. If you say the Duke students should open their minds and consume things they disagree with, you should say the same thing about the students who boycotted American Sniper. Otherwise, you do not really have a principled belief that people should respect and take in other opinions, you just believe they should respect and take in your own opinions. How can you think in one case the students are close-minded and sheltered, but in the other think they are open-minded and tolerant? What principled distinction is there that allows you to condemn one and praise the other, other than believing people who agree with you are better?

He proposes a bunch of potential counterarguments, then shoots each counterargument down by admitting that the other side would have a symmetrical counterargument of their own: for example, he believes that “American Sniper” is worse because it’s racist and promoting racism is genuinely dangerous to a free society, but then he admits a conservative could say that “Fun Home” is worse because in their opinion it’s homosexuality that’s genuinely dangerous to a free society. After three or four levels of this, he ends up concluding that he can’t come up with a meta-level fundamental difference, but he’s going to fight for his values anyway because they’re his. I’m not sure what I think of this conclusion, but my main response to his article is oh my gosh he gets the thing, where “the thing” is a hard-to-describe ability to understand that other people are going to go down as many levels to defend their self-consistent values as you will to defend yours. It seems silly when I’m saying it like this, and you should probably just read the article, but I’ve seen so many people who lack this basic mental operation that this immediately endeared him to me. I would argue Nathan Robinson has a piece of theory-of-mind that a lot of other people are missing.

Actually, I was kind of also thinking this with his most recent post, which complains about a Washington Post article. The Post argues that because the Democrats support gun control and protest police, they are becoming the “pro-crime party”. I’m not sure whether the Post genuinely believes the Democrats are pro-crime by inclination or are just arguing their policies will lead to more crime in a hyperbolic figurative way, but I’ve certainly seen sources further right make the “genuinely in favor of crime as a terminal value” argument. And this doesn’t seem too different from the leftist sources that say Republicans can’t really care about the lives of the unborn, they’re just “anti-woman” as a terminal value. Both proposals share this idea of not being able to understand that other people have different beliefs than you and that their actions proceed naturally from those beliefs. Instead of saying “I believe gun control would increase crime, but Democrats believe the opposite, and from their different perspective banning guns makes sense,” they say “I believe gun control would increase crime, Democrats must believe the same, and therefore their demands for gun control must come from sinister motives.”

(compare: “Brayden brought the Skittles bag with him for lunch, so he must enjoy eating pennies.” Or: “Daddy is refusing to watch Sesame Street with me, so he must be secretly watching it with someone else he likes better instead.”)

Here are some other mental operations which seem to me to rise to the level of developmental milestones:

1. Ability to distinguish “the things my brain tells me” from “reality” – maybe this is better phrased as “not immediately trusting my system 1 judgments”. This is a big part of cognitive therapy – building the understanding that just because your brain makes assessments like “I will definitely fail at this” or “I’m the worst person in the world” doesn’t mean that you have to believe them. As Ozy points out, this one can be easier for people with serious psychiatric problems who have a lot of experience with their brain’s snap assessments being really off, as opposed to everyone else who has to piece the insight together from a bunch of subtle failures.

2. Ability to model other people as having really different mind-designs from theirs; for example, the person who thinks that someone with depression is just “being lazy” or needs to “snap out of it”. This is one of the most important factors in determining whether I get along with somebody – people who don’t have this insight tend not to respect boundaries/preferences very much simply because they can’t believe they exist, and to simultaneously get angry when other people violate their supposedly-obvious-and-universal boundaries and preferences.

3. Ability to think probabilistically and tolerate uncertainty. My thoughts on this were mostly inspired by another of David Chapman’s posts, which I’m starting to think might not be a coincidence.

4. Understanding the idea of trade-offs; things like “the higher the threshold value of this medical test, the more likely we’ll catch real cases but also the more likely we’ll get false positives” or “the lower the burden of proof for people accused of crimes, the more likely we’ll get real criminals but also the more likely we’ll encourage false accusations”. When I hear people discuss these cases in real life, they’re almost never able to maintain this tension and almost always collapse it to their preferred plan having no downside.

Framed like this, both psychotherapy and LW-style rationality aim to teach people some of these extra mental operations. The reactions to both vary from enlightenment to boredom to bafflement depending on whether the listener needs the piece, already has the piece, or just plain lacks the socket that the piece is supposed to snap into.

This would have an funny corollary; the LW Sequences try to hammer in how different other minds can be from your own in order to develop the skill of thinking about artificial intelligences, but whether or not AI matters this might be an unusually effective hack to break a certain type of person out of their egocentrism and teach them how to deal with other humans.

This raises the obvious question of whether there are any basic mental operations I still don’t have, how I would recognize them if there were, and how I would learn them once I recognized them.

Roscoe Holyoake, 34, is accused of snatching the toddler in the Castro

An Australian disc jockey facing a kidnapping charge for allegedly grabbing a two-year-old child as he walked behind his mother in the Castro appeared in court for the first time Tuesday.

Roscoe Holyoake, 34, is accused of snatching the toddler near the intersection of Market and 17th streets last Friday. Bystanders detained Holyoake after the mother screamed for help and he allegedly tried to run away from the scene.

The child was not injured but suffered redness on his arms, prosecutors said.

Holyoake, who performs under the name DJ Roski, walked into the courtroom at the Hall of Justice wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. A slight man with graying hair on the sides, he spoke quietly and kept his eyes down.

His attorney, Deputy Public Defender Stephen Olmo, declined to enter a plea on behalf of his client until Thursday, when a San Francisco Superior Court judge will also decide whether to detain him without bail awaiting trial.

Outside the courtroom, Olmo suggested that the allegations were out of character for his client.

“He has no criminal record,” Olmo told reporters. “He has been in this country many times doing charitable work, disc jockey work.”

Court records show Holyoake is an Australian citizen who is in the U.S. on a visa through 2023.

Olmo said Holyoake was in San Francisco on business at the time of his arrest, but that he had not had a chance to review the facts of the case or speak with his client privately.

“I haven’t read a single sheet of the discovery,” Olmo said. “I’m just the guy that got assigned to the case ten minutes ago.”

Assistant District Attorney Brooke Jenkins described the allegations against Holyoake in a motion seeking to hold Holyoake without bail.

The kidnapping unfolded as the mother was pushing a stroller on 17th Street with her two-year-old son following closely behind her, according to the motion. The mother was putting her cellphone in her pocket when she allegedly saw Holyoake carrying her son with his arms wrapped around the child’s buttocks.

The court records describe a tug-of-war over the child between Holyoake and the mother, who began screaming.

“What are you doing!?” the mother yelled.

Holyoake allegedly began to run down 17th Street toward Noe Street with bystanders in pursuit.

Witnesses told the San Francisco Examiner that Holyoake turned left onto Noe Street and was detained halfway down the block in front of a tanning salon.

The Examiner obtained a video of the arrest.

Adam Walker, one of the bystanders who intervened, said he started chasing Holyoake after hearing the mother scream.

After he too yelled for help, a group of bystanders cut off the suspect and helped corner him.

Walker held Holyoake against the wall until police arrived and arrested him. Walker said the suspect did not resist and said nothing.

Walker described him as wearing khaki pants and being clean-shaven.

“It wasn’t something you would expect from someone dressed like that, he just looked like an average person,” Walker said. “It could have very easily been my child, and if he wasn’t caught it could have been my child next.”

People who work in the area told the Examiner the kidnapping was recorded on video, but declined to release the footage.

In court Tuesday, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Vedica Puri signed a stay-away order for Holyoake to remain at least 150 feet away from the mother and child.

Puri ruled that Holyoake would be held on $500,000 bail until a judge decides whether to hold him without bail later in the week.

Holyoake has been charged with felony kidnapping and child endangerment. He is facing up to eight years in prison.

Alex Bastian, a spokesperson for the District Attorney’s Office, could not comment on the details of the case but said, “we feel as though at this juncture the charges are appropriate.”

“We’re here in a criminal court case at the Hall of Justice, there is a child who is involved in this case, obviously for all of us that is very concerning,” Bastian told reporters outside the courtroom.

Chris Aalberts onderzoekt dit jaar de ontwikkeling van FvD. Hij kijkt naar de ontwikkeling van de partijorganisatie, de prestaties van FvD in Amsterdam en de werkzaamheden in de provincie, de Senaat en Brussel. Maak deze serie mogelijk en doneer via Voor de Kunst.

Forum voor Democratie (FvD) is in korte tijd uitgegroeid van een tweemansfractie in de Tweede Kamer tot virtueel de grootste partij van het land. Dat levert al snel vragen op hoe de partij georganiseerd is. Gisteren verscheen een interessant bericht op de website: ‘Professionalisering FvD gaat door’. We lezen dat de organisatorische opgaven voor FvD zo groot zijn dat het partijbestuur is uitgebreid met drie adviseurs. Wat betekent deze stap? Duidt dit echt op professionalisering?

Eerst de vraag wat de structuur van FvD ook alweer is en vervolgens de vraag wie er eigenlijk adviseur zijn geworden. Dan wordt al snel duidelijk wat er echt aan de hand is.

Eerst de theorie. Een politieke partij is een vereniging waarbij de basis wordt gevormd door de leden. Het zijn de leden die uiteindelijk de beslissingen nemen, de bestuurders benoemen en hen ook weer ontslaan. Bij een maatschappelijke organisatie – denk aan Greenpeace, Amnesty of de Hartstichting – is dat de structuur niet. Daar kun je donateur worden: je kunt met een financiële bijdrage je steun laten zien maar je hebt geen echte invloed op het beleid. Je kunt alleen weglopen als iets je niet bevalt.

FvD heeft ‘leden’ en is dus formeel een vereniging zoals andere partijen, maar in de praktijk hebben die leden niets te zeggen. Uit de statuten (artikelen 28.1 en 28.4) blijkt glashelder dat de leden het bestuur niet kunnen vervangen. Daarmee hebben ze ook geen invloed op het dagelijkse reilen en zeilen van de partijtop. Leden kunnen hooguit hun lidmaatschap opzeggen. Waar bij andere partijen door leden geklaagd kan worden over organisatorische kwesties – het aanstellen van adviseurs bijvoorbeeld – kan dat bij FvD in de praktijk niet. Je kunt wel klagen, maar niemand hoeft naar je te luisteren.

Is er reden om kritisch te zijn over de nieuwe adviseurs? Het blijken allemaal oude bekenden.

Paul Frentrop was ooit in beeld als partijvoorzitter en vervulde die positie ook op interim-basis. Hij werd echter nooit benoemd vanwege verschil van inzicht. Toen bleef Thierry Baudet zelf maar voorzitter. Het was volgens Frentrop een ‘verschil van mening in alle vriendelijkheid’. Nu is Frentrop terug: hij staat nu op de lijst voor de Eerste Kamer (no.4) en gaat het partijbestuur voorstellen doen over ‘de uitbouw van de partijorganisatie’. Het onderwerp dus waar hij eerder een meningsverschil over had.

Rob Roos is fractievoorzitter in Zuid-Holland. Hij is een druk man. Hij wordt hoogstwaarschijnlijk Senator (no.13) en is de nummer twee voor het Europees Parlement. Die twee functies zijn niet verenigbaar. Roos’ agenda is altijd een probleem: het Europees Parlement is praktisch ook niet echt combineerbaar met het Statenlidmaatschap, maar juist bij het Europees Parlement heeft FvD een tekort aan kandidaten. Er lijken er maar zes van de twaalf echt beschikbaar. Roos heeft nu tijd om ook nog naar de financiën van FvD te kijken.

Lennart van der Linden was persvoorlichter voor de Provinciale Statenverkiezingen, de campagne waarbij provinciale FvD-kandidaten nauwelijks in beeld kwamen. Hij was wethouder in de gemeente Barendrecht en is daar nu fractievoorzitter van Echt voor Barendrecht (EVB). Die partij won in 2018 de verkiezingen maar werkt zo slecht samen dat alle andere partijen besloten een coalitie te vormen zonder EVB. De partij van Van der Linden miste slechts één zetel voor de absolute meerderheid. Zelfreflectie is dan meer nodig dan de kreet ‘partijkartel’. Van der Linden wordt ook Senator (no.8).

Deze adviseurs hadden eerder inhoudelijke meningsverschillen met het bestuur, hebben geen tijd of lijken niet per se geschikt. Partijleden zouden er met recht vragen over kunnen stellen, maar die zijn bij FvD niet mogelijk want het partijbestuur mag deze adviseurs gewoon aanstellen en is zelf nauwelijks te ontslaan. De drie adviseurs komen allemaal in de Senaat, net als twee van de drie leden van het partijbestuur. Het derde lid is Baudet, die natuurlijk al in de Tweede Kamer zit. Zullen we het wederom centralisering van de macht noemen? Een vriendennetwerk deelt de lakens uit.

FvD noemt het anders: professionalisering. Dat mag natuurlijk, maar het probleem blijft hetzelfde: duizenden leden en tientallen Statenleden zitten in een partij waarin ze geen enkele macht hebben om de koers te bepalen terwijl ze er wel op worden aangesproken. Dat is zeker op langere termijn een hopeloze situatie want vroeg of laat zullen leden of volksvertegenwoordigers klaar zijn met bijvoorbeeld een onderwijsmeldpunt, boreale prietpraat of details over de moord op Anne Faber in de Tweede Kamer. Ze kunnen intern niets veranderen, alleen weglopen.

De benoeming van deze adviseurs suggereert vooral dat FvD hiërarchisch blijft. De adviseurs krijgen immers geen stemrecht: de drie partijbestuurders kijken wel uit echte macht te delen. Zelfs vrienden komen daarvoor niet in aanmerking.

Doctors have infused cells edited using CRISPR-Cas9 into two patients in a trial conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, NPR reports today (April 16). A university spokesperson confirmed in an emailed statement to The Scientist that the trial is underway and that two patients, one with multiple myeloma and one with sarcoma, have been treated so far. The study is the first instance of patients in the US being treated with a CRISPR-based therapy.

See “CRISPR Inches Toward the Clinic”

In an interview with The Scientist in June 2018, the leader of the study, oncologist Edward Stadtmauer, explained that CRISPR would be used as a tool in a new type of immunotherapy. His team would filter T cells from the blood of eligible patients with cancer, then use the gene-editing technique to knock out three of the cells’ existing receptors and with a lentiviral vector insert the gene for a receptor called NY-ESO-1, a protein that appears on the surface of some cancer cells. The modified cells would then be expanded for a few weeks in the lab. Patients would receive a brief course of chemotherapy, after which the cells would be infused back into them.

In addition to cancer applications, researchers are exploring the use of so-called ex vivo CRISPR editing—in which cells are altered outside the body and then given to patients—to treat blood disorders such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Other teams are working to develop therapies that would edit genes at fault in genetic diseases inside patients’ bodies.
An investigation by Channel 4 News also reveals how Arron Banks’ pro-Brexit group appears to have staged photos of migrants attacking women in London

The pro-Brexit campaign group, Leave.EU, faked a viral video and appear to have staged photos of “migrants”, shortly before the EU referendum.

An investigation by Channel 4 News found that images purporting to show “migrants” attacking young women in London seem to have been staged.

The group – backed by businessman Arron Banks – was also behind a fake video, claiming to show how easy it is for migrants to sneak into Britain. In reality, satellite data shows the men on board had not left UK waters.

The photographs and video both involved a former SAS soldier, Jonathan Pollen, who works for Banks’ corporate intelligence agency.

Although the photos were never used, the fake video went viral, garnering hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook.

Responding to the investigation Arron Banks accused Channel 4 News journalists of creating “fake news” themselves.

But Labour MP Jo Stevens, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sports Committee described the video and images to Channel 4 News as “fake news”.

“The video of the boat is very obviously fake and put together in a fake way. The photographs are a little bit more difficult to spot that, but clearly fake news with a deliberate intention of stoking hatred and anti-immigrant feeling and rhetoric.”

She added: “We have local government elections, we have potentially European Parliament elections, we might have a General Election, and we might have a second referendum – and we still have no regulation around digital campaigning and the sort of disinformation and fake news, which will play a part in all of those elections, unless some regulation is put in place.”

‘Migrant’ images

Just days before the EU referendum in 2016, Leave.EU published an “undercover investigation” on Facebook, purporting to show how easy it is to smuggle migrants across the Channel.

But satellite data, seen by Channel 4 News, shows the footage was filmed in reverse. The shots of “migrants” entering the UK were actually filmed before the boat had even left British waters.

Just days earlier, Leave.EU was also behind a series of seemingly-staged photographs that show a woman being violently attacked by a man wearing a hooded jacket. Another photo appeared to show a woman being grabbed from behind as she walks into a shop.

One of the attackers seen in the photos is wearing a distinctive grey denim jacket, with black leather sleeves and a white hood. A strikingly similar outfit is worn by one of the “migrants” seen in the Channel crossing video.

Leaked emails, seen by Channel 4 News, show the pictures were emailed by Mr Pollen to Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s head of communications and Arron Banks’ right hand man.

Mr Wigmore then forwarded them on to Leave.EU press team, saying: “Migrants beating up girl in Tottenham [on] Saturday… Can we get this ready to go as a press release.”

In a statement, Arron Banks told Channel 4 News: “Leave.eu is the biggest viral political campaign in the UK, with 3.7 million engagements last week on Facebook alone. Dwarfing political parties and other groups.”

“Channel 4 is packed with ex-Guardian journalists and left wing activists, who create Fake news for a living!

“The campaign must be doing something right to annoy all the right people consistently.”

Phil Campion, who fronted the Channel crossing video, firmly denied that he personally was involved in faking anything.

“I am not deceiving anybody. I didn’t cut the video. I didn’t cut the footage. I gave them the footage they asked me for, okay? I brought people back from France.”

Jonathan Pollen did not respond to our request to comment.

Missing Link is the first of Laika’s films to be released by United Artists Releasing and Annapurna Pictures. The first four Laika films were released by Focus Features.

Missing Link earned less than half of Laika’s previous-lowest opening, which was $12.6M for Kubo and the Two Strings in 2016. While box office projections for Missing Link had already been low — in the $8-12 million range — no one expected that it would dive far lower than those estimates. Even more disconcerting, each of Laika’s films has grossed less overall at the U.S. box office than its predecessor, and Missing Link is now all but guaranteed to continue that trend.

One of the unfortunate side effects of such a weak opening is that film studios will inevitably cast blame on the stop-motion process itself. The long-running narrative in the animation industry has been that audiences only want to see cg animation, and Laika’s weak performances at the box office continually feed into that narrative.

But stop motion does not deserve the blame here. For starters, Missing Link is a hybrid film that incorporates heavy amounts cg and vfx artistry in addition to stop motion. And if audiences specifically avoid stop motion, then how to explain the similarly poor start of the all-cg effort Strange Magic, or more recently, Paramount Animation’s Wonder Park?

If we’re being honest, average moviegoers (i.e. people who don’t read websites like Cartoon Brew) lack enough understanding of animation techniques to properly distinguish between cg and stop motion, so it’s highly unlikely that any statistically significant amount of moviegoers avoided Missing Link simply because of its technique.

So what accounts for this dismal start? A lack of advertising? Missing Link was promoted extensively, and even topped tv ad spending in early April. On the other hand, the barely advertised (and disastrously-reviewed) teen romance-drama After not only opened higher this weekend than Missing Link, but its per-screen average landed in the top five.

The simple answer about Missing Link’s poor performance is that there is no simple answer. A variety of factors ultimately played a role, and I’m sure we’ll hear more about those factors in the future.

One of the most basic flaws from my perspective: it was never really clear who the film’s target audience was supposed to be. The cautious, conflict-free trailers and goofy design of the main character gave Missing Link the appearance of a film for very young kids, while its style of comedy and Victorian-era setting clearly skewed to an older audience. This inconsistent branding, even in its own trailers, almost certainly played a role in confusing moviegoers about the film. The aforementioned After may not have been advertised as extensively — and it may have not been a very good film — but take one look at the trailer and it’s blatantly obvious what type of a film it is and who’s going to watch it.

You’ve got one more weekend to check out Missing Link before Avengers: Endgame takes over the multiplexes.

The instant Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last June, Chief Justice John Roberts became one of the most watched men in America. With Kennedy gone, Roberts now holds the balance of power on a court otherwise split between four Democrats and four Republicans who are even more conservative than the Chief.

And, next Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear a case that is likely to provide the clearest window to date into just how willing the Chief Justice is to politicize his court.

As a man, Roberts appears immune to sympathy for victims of voting discrimination. As a young Justice Department lawyer, Roberts urged President Ronald Reagan to veto a law ensuring that Voting Rights Act plaintiffs would be able to prevail against voter suppression. As chief justice, Roberts voted to gut a key provision of that same act — based on his belief that the United States is no longer racist enough to justify a fully operational Voting Rights Act.

The next presidential election, fully 46 percent of the electorate voted for Donald Trump.

And yet, there is another side to the Chief. Roberts is the last gasp of a conservatism that is fearful of unchecked judicial power and that believes the Supreme Court has a limited role to play in a democracy. He famously saved most of the Affordable Care Act from a politically motivated lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general, then wrote an opinion saving the law again from a similarly political suit just three years later. Even when Roberts voted against marriage equality in 2015, he did so in an opinion warning his fellow conservatives of the kind of judicial overreach that drives a growing list of Republican judges.

Roberts, in other words, is unpersuaded by appeals to liberal values, but he does care about his court as an institution, and he can sometimes be persuaded to side with liberals out of fear that the judiciary will be perceived as too political — and too eager to bend the law to benefit conservatives and Republicans.

Which brings us to Department of Commerce v. New York.

Rigging the Census

If New York didn’t involve a question at the heart of who will be represented in the United States government — that is, if it wasn’t precisely the sort of politically charged case that tends to bypass judges’ brains and activate their partisanship — then it would be a slam dunk against the Trump administration. It involves a tale of procedural errors, rank incompetence, and outright deception by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and others, all apparently designed to shift power away from immigrant communities and toward white voters who are more likely to support Republicans.

The Constitution assigns seats in the House of Representatives “among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.” Thus, excepting Native Americans immune from taxation, all people in the United States must be counted in the Census, regardless of their citizenship status. And every person living in a state counts towards determining how many representatives that state shall have, regardless of each person’s immigration status.

As recently as the Jim Crow era, the decennial census form asked residents to identify whether or not they are citizens, but the United States abandoned this practice decades ago. As the Census’ top officials from the Reagan and Bush I administrations warned, asking about citizenship “could seriously jeopardize the accuracy of the census,” because “people who are undocumented immigrants may either avoid the census altogether or deliberately misreport themselves as legal residents,” while legal residents “may misunderstand or mistrust the census and fail or refuse to respond.”

According to one estimate, the 2020 Census could undercount the U.S. population by as much as 24 million people if it asks people about citizenship.

That’s very bad news if you care about accuracy, or about fairly apportioning representation and federal funding according to where people actually live. But if your goal is to disempower immigrant communities that are unlikely to support Trump, adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census form is a pretty good way to do it.

Racism defeated by incompetence

There’s a strong argument that the Trump administration’s citizenship question violates the Constitution’s requirement that the Census provide an “actual Enumeration” of U.S. residents. But let’s set that argument aside. Chief Justice Roberts is rarely sympathetic to claims that voter suppression violates the Constitution, and New York is unlikely to be an exception.

The reason why this challenge to the citizenship question has a fighting chance is that the Trump administration’s actions do not just violate the Constitution, they also violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which prohibits agencies from taking “arbitrary” or “capricious” action. As the Supreme Court held in Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB “not only must an agency’s decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the process by which it reaches that result must be logical and rational.”

Though Roberts is typically unsympathetic to constitutional arguments in favor of voting rights, he is very sympathetic to arguments that a federal agency did not follow proper procedures — or, at least, he is sympathetic to these arguments outside of the context of national security. Roberts frequently writes opinions calling for federal agencies to have less discretion over domestic policy.

Which may explain why Judge Jesse Furman, the lower court judge whose opinion is now on appeal to the Supreme Court, spent a better part of his 277-page opinion laying out why the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the Census violates the APA. Indeed, Judge Furman’s opinion presents Secretary Ross, who led the administration’s efforts to add the question to the Census form, as grossly incompetent — ignoring clear statutory mandates, as well as the advice of his own experts within the Census Bureau.

The Census Act, for example, compels the Census to “‘acquire and use information’ derived from administrative records ‘instead of conducting direct inquiries’ to the ‘maximum extent possible.’” So the Census may not use a citizenship question if it could obtain information on citizenship through government records. Yet when Census officials advised Ross that existing government records would do a better job of identifying who is a citizen than a citizenship question on the Census — in no small part because many non-citizens would falsely identify themselves as citizens — those officials were ignored.

Federal law also requires “that the Secretary report to the relevant congressional committees, at least three years before the ‘census date’ for a given census, all ‘subjects proposed to be included, and the types of information to be compiled.’” But Ross did not give Congress the required notice regarding the citizenship question.

In some cases, Ross appears to have ignored — perhaps willfully — evidence presented to him by his own agency. As Furman writes:

Secretary Ross’s explanations for his decision [to add the citizenship question] were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before the agency. For instance, he sought to justify his decision on the ground that “no one provided evidence that reinstating a citizenship question on the decennial census would materially decrease response rates.” But that assertion is simply untrue. The Administrative Record is rife with both quantitative and qualitative evidence, from the Census Bureau itself, demonstrating that the addition of a citizenship question to the census questionnaire would indeed materially reduce response rates among immigrant and Hispanic households.

The Bureau “calculated in January 2018 that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census was likely to lead to a 5.1% differential decrease in self-response rates among noncitizen households.”

Worst of all, Ross appears to have lied about the true reason for the citizenship question. Though the secretary claims that it was added because the Justice Department requested such a question to help in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, Furman found that “Secretary Ross had made the decision to add the citizenship question well before DOJ requested its addition in December 2017.” Thus, “the evidence is clear that Secretary Ross’s rationale was pretextual — that is, that the real reason for his decision was something other than the sole reason he put forward in his Memorandum, namely enhancement of DOJ’s VRA enforcement efforts.”

If New York involved a different, less politically charged set of circumstances, then it is hard to imagine Roberts — or, indeed, very many judges at all — tolerating this kind of behavior. The federal government typically does not ignore explicit statutory mandates, nor does it give the middle finger to its own conclusions, or misrepresent its true motivations when it makes a shift in policy. And courts understandably are not sympathetic when the government does behave this way.

But New York arrives at the Supreme Court packaged with all the political baggage that any major voting rights case brings, and that makes its outcome uncertain. Motivated reasoning is a hell of a drug.

If Roberts is able to set aside his partisan preferences and evaluate New York the same way he would any other case that involves an egregious violation of the rules governing administrative procedure, that will be a hopeful sign that he will steer his court away from blind partisanship — and that Democrats may still live under something resembling the rule of law.

Should Roberts take a different path, however, that will be an even more ominous sign. If the Chief cannot set aside his partisan preferences in a case as clear cut as this one, then the future of American democracy is quite grim.

The streets of Davos, Switzerland, were iced over on the night of January 25, 2018, which added a slight element of danger to the prospect of trekking to the Hotel Seehof for George Soros’ annual banquet. The aged financier has a tradition of hosting a dinner at the World Economic Forum, where he regales tycoons, ministers, and journalists with his thoughts about the state of the world. That night he began by warning in his quiet, shaking Hungarian accent about nuclear war and climate change. Then he shifted to his next idea of a global menace: Google and Facebook. “Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment,” he said. “The owners of the platform giants consider themselves the masters of the universe, but in fact they are slaves to preserving their dominant position ... Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.” Across town, a group of senior Facebook executives, including COO Sheryl Sandberg and vice president of global communications Elliot Schrage, had set up a temporary headquarters near the base of the mountain where Thomas Mann put his fictional sanatorium. The world’s biggest companies often establish receiving rooms at the world’s biggest elite confab, but this year Facebook’s pavilion wasn’t the usual scene of airy bonhomie. It was more like a bunker—one that saw a succession of tense meetings with the same tycoons, ministers, and journalists who had nodded along to Soros’ broadside. Over the previous year Facebook’s stock had gone up as usual, but its reputation was rapidly sinking toward junk bond status. The world had learned how Russian intelligence operatives used the platform to manipulate US voters. Genocidal monks in Myanmar and a despot in the Philippines had taken a liking to the platform. Mid-level employees at the company were getting both crankier and more empowered, and critics everywhere were arguing that Facebook’s tools fostered tribalism and outrage. That argument gained credence with every utterance of Donald Trump, who had arrived in Davos that morning, the outrageous tribalist skunk at the globalists’ garden party. May 2019. Subscribe to WIRED. Frank J. Guzzone CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recently pledged to spend 2018 trying to fix Facebook. But even the company’s nascent attempts to reform itself were being scrutinized as a possible declaration of war on the institutions of democracy. Earlier that month Facebook had unveiled a major change to its News Feed rankings to favor what the company called “meaningful social interactions.” News Feed is the core of Facebook—the central stream through which flow baby pictures, press reports, New Age koans, and Russian-­made memes showing Satan endorsing Hillary Clinton. The changes would favor interactions between friends, which meant, among other things, that they would disfavor stories published by media companies. The company promised, though, that the blow would be softened somewhat for local news and publications that scored high on a user-driven metric of “trustworthiness.” Davos provided a first chance for many media executives to confront Facebook’s leaders about these changes. And so, one by one, testy publishers and editors trudged down Davos Platz to Facebook’s headquarters throughout the week, ice cleats attached to their boots, seeking clarity. Facebook had become a capricious, godlike force in the lives of news organizations; it fed them about a third of their referral traffic while devouring a greater and greater share of the advertising revenue the media industry relies on. And now this. Why? Why would a company beset by fake news stick a knife into real news? And what would Facebook’s algorithm deem trustworthy? Would the media executives even get to see their own scores? Facebook didn’t have ready answers to all of these questions; certainly not ones it wanted to give. The last one in particular—about trustworthiness scores—quickly inspired a heated debate among the company’s executives at Davos and their colleagues in Menlo Park. Some leaders, including Schrage, wanted to tell publishers their scores. It was only fair. Also in agreement was Campbell Brown, the company’s chief liaison with news publishers, whose job description includes absorbing some of the impact when Facebook and the news industry crash into one another. But the engineers and product managers back at home in California said it was folly. Adam Mosseri, then head of News Feed, argued in emails that publishers would game the system if they knew their scores. Plus, they were too unsophisticated to understand the methodology, and the scores would constantly change anyway. To make matters worse, the company didn’t yet have a reliable measure of trustworthiness at hand. Heated emails flew back and forth between Switzerland and Menlo Park. Solutions were proposed and shot down. It was a classic Facebook dilemma. The company’s algorithms embraid choices so complex and interdependent that it’s hard for any human to get a handle on it all. If you explain some of what is happening, people get confused. They also tend to obsess over tiny factors in huge equations. So in this case, as in so many others over the years, Facebook chose opacity. Nothing would be revealed in Davos, and nothing would be revealed afterward. The media execs would walk away unsatisfied. Related Stories Inside the Two Years That Shook Facebook—and the World

Facebook Let Dozens of Cybercrime Groups Operate in Plain Sight

Facebook's Sloppy Data-Sharing Deals Might Be Criminal After Soros’ speech that Thursday night, those same editors and publishers headed back to their hotels, many to write, edit, or at least read all the news pouring out about the billionaire’s tirade. The words “their days are numbered” appeared in article after article. The next day, Sandberg sent an email to Schrage asking if he knew whether Soros had shorted Facebook’s stock. Far from Davos, meanwhile, Facebook’s product engineers got down to the precise, algorithmic business of implementing Zuckerberg’s vision. If you want to promote trustworthy news for billions of people, you first have to specify what is trustworthy and what is news. Facebook was having a hard time with both. To define trustworthiness, the company was testing how people responded to surveys about their impressions of different publishers. To define news, the engineers pulled a classification system left over from a previous project—one that pegged the category as stories involving “politics, crime, or tragedy.” That particular choice, which meant the algorithm would be less kind to all kinds of other news—from health and science to technology and sports—wasn’t something Facebook execs discussed with media leaders in Davos. And though it went through reviews with senior managers, not everyone at the company knew about it either. When one Facebook executive learned about it recently in a briefing with a lower-­level engineer, they say they “nearly fell on the fucking floor.” The confusing rollout of meaningful social interactions—marked by internal dissent, blistering external criticism, genuine efforts at reform, and foolish mistakes—set the stage for Facebook’s 2018. This is the story of that annus horribilis, based on interviews with 65 current and former employees. It’s ultimately a story about the biggest shifts ever to take place inside the world’s biggest social network. But it’s also about a company trapped by its own pathologies and, perversely, by the inexorable logic of its own recipe for success. Facebook’s powerful network effects have kept advertisers from fleeing, and overall user numbers remain healthy if you include people on Insta­gram, which Facebook owns. But the company’s original culture and mission kept creating a set of brutal debts that came due with regularity over the past 16 months. The company floundered, dissembled, and apologized. Even when it told the truth, people didn’t believe it. Critics appeared on all sides, demanding changes that ranged from the essential to the contradictory to the impossible. As crises multiplied and diverged, even the company’s own solutions began to cannibalize each other. And the most crucial episode in this story—the crisis that cut the deepest—began not long after Davos, when some reporters from The New York Times, The Guardian, and Britain’s Channel 4 News came calling. They’d learned some troubling things about a shady British company called Cambridge Analytica, and they had some questions. II.

It was, in some ways, an old story. Back in 2014, a young academic at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan built a personality questionnaire app called ­thisisyourdigitallife. A few hundred thousand people signed up, giving Kogan access not only to their Facebook data but also—because of Facebook’s loose privacy policies at the time—to that of up to 87 million people in their combined friend networks. Rather than simply use all of that data for research purposes, which he had permission to do, Kogan passed the trove on to Cambridge Analytica, a strategic consulting firm that talked a big game about its ability to model and manipulate human behavior for political clients. In December 2015, The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica had used this data to help Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, at which point Facebook demanded the data be deleted. This much Facebook knew in the early months of 2018. The company also knew—because everyone knew—that Cambridge Analytica had gone on to work with the Trump campaign after Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. And some people at Facebook worried that the story of their company’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica was not over. One former Facebook communications official remembers being warned by a manager in the summer of 2017 that unresolved elements of the Cambridge Analytica story remained a grave vulnerability. No one at Facebook, however, knew exactly when or where the unexploded ordnance would go off. “The company doesn’t know yet what it doesn’t know yet,” the manager said. (The manager now denies saying so.) The company first heard in late February that the Times and The Guardian had a story coming, but the department in charge of formulating a response was a house divided. In the fall, Facebook had hired a brilliant but fiery veteran of tech industry PR named Rachel Whetstone. She’d come over from Uber to run communications for Facebook’s WhatsApp, Insta­gram, and Messenger. Soon she was traveling with Zuckerberg for public events, joining Sandberg’s senior management meetings, and making decisions—like picking which outside public relations firms to cut or retain—that normally would have rested with those officially in charge of Facebook’s 300-person communications shop. The staff quickly sorted into fans and haters. And so it was that a confused and fractious communications team huddled with management to debate how to respond to the Times and Guardian reporters. The standard approach would have been to correct misinformation or errors and spin the company’s side of the story. Facebook ultimately chose another tack. It would front-run the press: dump a bunch of information out in public on the eve of the stories’ publication, hoping to upstage them. It’s a tactic with a short-term benefit but a long-term cost. Investigative journalists are like pit bulls. Kick them once and they’ll never trust you again. Facebook’s decision to take that risk, according to multiple people involved, was a close call. But on the night of Friday, March 16, the company announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica from its platform. This was a fateful choice. “It’s why the Times hates us,” one senior executive says. Another communications official says, “For the last year, I’ve had to talk to reporters worried that we were going to front-run them. It’s the worst. Whatever the calculus, it wasn’t worth it.” The tactic also didn’t work. The next day the story—focused on a charismatic whistle-­blower with pink hair named Christopher Wylie—exploded in Europe and the United States. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, was claiming that the company had not deleted the data it had taken from Facebook and that it may have used that data to swing the American presidential election. The first sentence of The Guardian’s reporting blared that this was “one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches” and that Cambridge Analytica had used the data “to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.” The story was a witch’s brew of Russian operatives, privacy violations, confusing data, and Donald Trump. It touched on nearly all the fraught issues of the moment. Politicians called for regulation; users called for boycotts. In a day, Facebook lost $36 billion in its market cap. Because many of its employees were compensated based on the stock’s performance, the drop did not go unnoticed in Menlo Park. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches To this emotional story, Facebook had a programmer’s rational response. Nearly every fact in The Guardian’s opening paragraph was misleading, its leaders believed. The company hadn’t been breached—an academic had fairly downloaded data with permission and then unfairly handed it off. And the software that Cambridge Analytica built was not powerful, nor could it predict or influence choices at the ballot box. But none of that mattered. When a Facebook executive named Alex Stamos tried on Twitter to argue that the word breach was being misused, he was swatted down. He soon deleted his tweets. His position was right, but who cares? If someone points a gun at you and holds up a sign that says hand’s up, you shouldn’t worry about the apostrophe. The story was the first of many to illuminate one of the central ironies of Facebook’s struggles. The company’s algorithms helped sustain a news ecosystem that prioritizes outrage, and that news ecosystem was learning to direct outrage at Facebook. As the story spread, the company started melting down. Former employees remember scenes of chaos, with exhausted executives slipping in and out of Zuckerberg’s private conference room, known as the Aquarium, and Sandberg’s conference room, whose name, Only Good News, seemed increasingly incongruous. One employee remembers cans and snack wrappers everywhere; the door to the Aquarium would crack open and you could see people with their heads in their hands and feel the warmth from all the body heat. After saying too much before the story ran, the company said too little afterward. Senior managers begged Sandberg and Zuckerberg to publicly confront the issue. Both remained publicly silent. “We had hundreds of reporters flooding our inboxes, and we had nothing to tell them,” says a member of the communications staff at the time. “I remember walking to one of the cafeterias and overhearing other Facebookers say, ‘Why aren’t we saying anything? Why is nothing happening?’ ” According to numerous people who were involved, many factors contributed to Facebook’s baffling decision to stay mute for five days. Executives didn’t want a repeat of Zuckerberg’s ignominious performance after the 2016 election when, mostly off the cuff, he had proclaimed it “a pretty crazy idea” to think fake news had affected the result. And they continued to believe people would figure out that Cambridge Analytica’s data had been useless. According to one executive, “You can just buy all this fucking stuff, all this data, from the third-party ad networks that are tracking you all over the planet. You can get way, way, way more privacy-­violating data from all these data brokers than you could by stealing it from Facebook.” “Those five days were very, very long,” says Sandberg, who now acknowledges the delay was a mistake. The company became paralyzed, she says, because it didn’t know all the facts; it thought Cambridge Analytica had deleted the data. And it didn’t have a specific problem to fix. The loose privacy policies that allowed Kogan to collect so much data had been tightened years before. “We didn’t know how to respond in a system of imperfect information,” she says. Facebook’s other problem was that it didn’t understand the wealth of antipathy that had built up against it over the previous two years. Its prime decisionmakers had run the same playbook successfully for a decade and a half: Do what they thought was best for the platform’s growth (often at the expense of user privacy), apologize if someone complained, and keep pushing forward. Or, as the old slogan went: Move fast and break things. Now the public thought Facebook had broken Western democracy. This privacy violation—unlike the many others before it—wasn’t one that people would simply get over. Finally, on Wednesday, the company decided Zuckerberg should give a television interview. After snubbing CBS and PBS, the company summoned a CNN reporter who the communications staff trusted to be reasonably kind. The network’s camera crews were treated like potential spies, and one communications official remembers being required to monitor them even when they went to the bathroom. (Facebook now says this was not company protocol.) In the interview itself, Zuckerberg apologized. But he was also specific: There would be audits and much more restrictive rules for anyone wanting access to Facebook data. Facebook would build a tool to let users know if their data had ended up with Cambridge Analytica. And he pledged that Facebook would make sure this kind of debacle never happened again. A flurry of other interviews followed. That Wednesday, WIRED was given a quiet heads-up that we’d get to chat with Zuckerberg in the late afternoon. At about 4:45 pm, his communications chief rang to say he would be calling at 5. In that interview, Zuckerberg apologized again. But he brightened when he turned to one of the topics that, according to people close to him, truly engaged his imagination: using AI to keep humans from polluting Facebook. This was less a response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal than to the backlog of accusations, gathering since 2016, that Facebook had become a cesspool of toxic virality, but it was a problem he actually enjoyed figuring out how to solve. He didn’t think that AI could completely eliminate hate speech or nudity or spam, but it could get close. “My understanding with food safety is there’s a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as it’s going through the processing, and it’s not a large amount—it needs to be a very small amount,” he told WIRED. The interviews were just the warmup for Zuckerberg’s next gauntlet: A set of public, televised appearances in April before three congressional committees to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and months of other scandals. Congresspeople had been calling on him to testify for about a year, and he’d successfully avoided them. Now it was game time, and much of Facebook was terrified about how it would go. As it turned out, most of the lawmakers proved astonishingly uninformed, and the CEO spent most of the day ably swatting back soft pitches. Back home, some Facebook employees stood in their cubicles and cheered. When a plodding Senator Orrin Hatch asked how, exactly, Facebook made money while offering its services for free, Zuckerberg responded confidently, “Senator, we run ads,” a phrase that was soon emblazoned on T-shirts in Menlo Park. Adam Maida III.

The Saturday after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Sandberg told Molly Cutler, a top lawyer at Facebook, to create a crisis response team. Make sure we never have a delay responding to big issues like that again, Sandberg said. She put Cutler’s new desk next to hers, to guarantee Cutler would have no problem convincing division heads to work with her. “I started the role that Monday,” Cutler says. “I never made it back to my old desk. After a couple of weeks someone on the legal team messaged me and said, ‘You want us to pack up your things? It seems like you are not coming back.’ ” Then Sandberg and Zuckerberg began making a huge show of hiring humans to keep watch over the platform. Soon you couldn’t listen to a briefing or meet an executive without being told about the tens of thousands of content moderators who had joined the company. By the end of 2018, about 30,000 people were working on safety and security, which is roughly the number of newsroom employees at all the newspapers in the United States. Of those, about 15,000 are content reviewers, mostly contractors, employed at more than 20 giant review factories around the world. Facebook was also working hard to create clear rules for enforcing its basic policies, effectively writing a constitution for the 1.5 billion daily users of the platform. The instructions for moderating hate speech alone run to more than 200 pages. Moderators must undergo 80 hours of training before they can start. Among other things, they must be fluent in emoji; they study, for example, a document showing that a crown, roses, and dollar signs might mean a pimp is offering up prostitutes. About 100 people across the company meet every other Tuesday to review the policies. A similar group meets every Friday to review content policy enforcement screwups, like when, as happened in early July, the company flagged the Declaration of Independence as hate speech. The company hired all of these people in no small part because of pressure from its critics. It was also the company’s fate, however, that the same critics discovered that moderating content on Facebook can be a miserable, soul-scorching job. As Casey Newton reported in an investigation for the Verge, the average content moderator in a Facebook contractor’s outpost in Arizona makes $28,000 per year, and many of them say they have developed PTSD-like symptoms due to their work. Others have spent so much time looking through conspiracy theories that they’ve become believers themselves. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence Ultimately, Facebook knows that the job will have to be done primarily by machines—which is the company’s preference anyway. Machines can browse porn all day without flatlining, and they haven’t learned to unionize yet. And so simultaneously the company mounted a huge effort, led by CTO Mike Schroepfer, to create artificial intelligence systems that can, at scale, identify the content that Facebook wants to zap from its platform, including spam, nudes, hate speech, ISIS propaganda, and videos of children being put in washing machines. An even trickier goal was to identify the stuff that Facebook wants to demote but not eliminate—like misleading clickbait crap. Over the past several years, the core AI team at Facebook has doubled in size annually. Even a basic machine-learning system can pretty reliably identify and block pornography or images of graphic violence. Hate speech is much harder. A sentence can be hateful or prideful depending on who says it. “You not my bitch, then bitch you are done,” could be a death threat, an inspiration, or a lyric from Cardi B. Imagine trying to decode a similarly complex line in Spanish, Mandarin, or Burmese. False news is equally tricky. Facebook doesn’t want lies or bull on the platform. But it knows that truth can be a kaleidoscope. Well-meaning people get things wrong on the internet; malevolent actors sometimes get things right. Schroepfer’s job was to get Facebook’s AI up to snuff on catching even these devilishly ambiguous forms of content. With each category the tools and the success rate vary. But the basic technique is roughly the same: You need a collection of data that has been categorized, and then you need to train the machines on it. For spam and nudity these databases already exist, created by hand in more innocent days when the threats online were fake Viagra and Goatse memes, not Vladimir Putin and Nazis. In the other categories you need to construct the labeled data sets yourself—ideally without hiring an army of humans to do so. One idea Schroepfer discussed enthusiastically with WIRED involved starting off with just a few examples of content identified by humans as hate speech and then using AI to generate similar content and simultaneously label it. Like a scientist bioengineering both rodents and rat terriers, this approach would use software to both create and identify ever-more-complex slurs, insults, and racist crap. Eventually the terriers, specially trained on superpowered rats, could be set loose across all of Facebook. The company’s efforts in AI that screens content were nowhere roughly three years ago. But Facebook quickly found success in classifying spam and posts supporting terror. Now more than 99 percent of content created in those categories is identified before any human on the platform flags it. Sex, as in the rest of human life, is more complicated. The success rate for identifying nudity is 96 percent. Hate speech is even tougher: Facebook finds just 52 percent before users do. These are the kinds of problems that Facebook executives love to talk about. They involve math and logic, and the people who work at the company are some of the most logical you’ll ever meet. But Cambridge Analytica was mostly a privacy scandal. Facebook’s most visible response to it was to amp up content moderation aimed at keeping the platform safe and civil. Yet sometimes the two big values involved—privacy and civility—come into opposition. If you give people ways to keep their data completely secret, you also create secret tunnels where rats can scurry around undetected. In other words, every choice involves a trade-off, and every trade-off means some value has been spurned. And every value that you spurn—particularly when you’re Facebook in 2018—means that a hammer is going to come down on your head. IV.

Crises offer opportunities. They force you to make some changes, but they also provide cover for the changes you’ve long wanted to make. And four weeks after Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress, the company initiated the biggest reshuffle in its history. About a dozen executives shifted chairs. Most important, Chris Cox, longtime head of Facebook’s core product—known internally as the Blue App—would now oversee WhatsApp and Insta­gram too. Cox was perhaps Zuckerberg’s closest and most trusted confidant, and it seemed like succession planning. Adam Mosseri moved over to run product at Insta­gram. Insta­gram, which was founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, had been acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion. The price at the time seemed ludicrously high: That much money for a company with 13 employees? Soon the price would seem ludicrously low: A mere billion dollars for the fastest-growing social network in the world? Internally, Facebook at first watched Insta­gram’s relentless growth with pride. But, according to some, pride turned to suspicion as the pupil’s success matched and then surpassed the professor’s. Systrom’s glowing press coverage didn’t help. In 2014, according to someone directly involved, Zuckerberg ordered that no other executives should sit for magazine profiles without his or Sandberg’s approval. Some people involved remember this as a move to make it harder for rivals to find employees to poach; others remember it as a direct effort to contain Systrom. Top executives at Facebook also believed that Insta­gram’s growth was cannibalizing the Blue App. In 2017, Cox’s team showed data to senior executives suggesting that people were sharing less inside the Blue App in part because of Insta­gram. To some people, this sounded like they were simply presenting a problem to solve. Others were stunned and took it as a sign that management at Facebook cared more about the product they had birthed than one they had adopted. By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them. Most of Insta­gram—and some of Facebook too—hated the idea that the growth of the photo-sharing app could be seen, in any way, as trouble. Yes, people were using the Blue App less and Insta­gram more. But that didn’t mean Insta­gram was poaching users. Maybe people leaving the Blue App would have spent their time on Snapchat or watching Netflix or mowing their lawns. And if Insta­gram was growing quickly, maybe it was because the product was good? Insta­gram had its problems—bullying, shaming, FOMO, propaganda, corrupt micro-­influencers—but its internal architecture had helped it avoid some of the demons that haunted the industry. Posts are hard to reshare, which slows virality. External links are harder to embed, which keeps the fake-news providers away. Minimalist design also minimized problems. For years, Systrom and Krieger took pride in keeping Insta­gram free of hamburgers: icons made of three horizontal lines in the corner of a screen that open a menu. Facebook has hamburgers, and other menus, all over the place. Systrom and Krieger had also seemingly anticipated the techlash ahead of their colleagues up the road in Menlo Park. Even before Trump’s election, Insta­gram had made fighting toxic comments its top priority, and it had rolled out an AI filtering system in June 2017. By the spring of 2018, the company was working on a product to alert users that “you’re all caught up” when they’d seen all the new posts in their feed. In other words, “put your damn phone down and talk to your friends.” That may be a counterintuitive way to grow, but earning goodwill does help over the long run. And sacrificing growth for other goals wasn’t Facebook’s style at all. By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Systrom and Krieger, according to people familiar with their thinking, were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them. They had been allowed to run their company reasonably independently for six years, but now Zuckerberg was exerting more control and making more requests. When conversations about the reorganization began, the Insta­gram founders pushed to bring in Mosseri. They liked him, and they viewed him as the most trustworthy member of Zuckerberg’s inner circle. He had a design background and a mathematical mind. They were losing autonomy, so they might as well get the most trusted emissary from the mothership. Or as Lyndon Johnson said about J. Edgar Hoover, “It’s probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in.” Meanwhile, the founders of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, had moved outside of Facebook’s tent and commenced fire. Zuckerberg had bought the encrypted messaging platform in 2014 for $19 billion, but the cultures had never entirely meshed. The two sides couldn’t agree on how to make money—WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption wasn’t originally designed to support targeted ads—and they had other differences as well. WhatsApp insisted on having its own conference rooms, and, in the perfect metaphor for the two companies’ diverging attitudes over privacy, WhatsApp employees had special bathroom stalls designed with doors that went down to the floor, unlike the standard ones used by the rest of Facebook. Eventually the battles became too much for Acton and Koum, who had also come to believe that Facebook no longer intended to leave them alone. Acton quit and started funding a competing messaging platform called Signal. During the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he tweeted, “It is time. #deletefacebook.” Soon afterward, Koum, who held a seat on Facebook’s board, announced that he too was quitting, to play more Ultimate Frisbee and work on his collection of air-cooled Porsches. The departure of the WhatsApp founders created a brief spasm of bad press. But now Acton and Koum were gone, Mosseri was in place, and Cox was running all three messaging platforms. And that meant Facebook could truly pursue its most ambitious and important idea of 2018: bringing all those platforms together into something new. V.

By the late spring, news organizations—even as they jockeyed for scoops about the latest meltdown in Menlo Park—were starting to buckle under the pain caused by Facebook’s algorithmic changes. Back in May of 2017, according to Parse.ly, Facebook drove about 40 percent of all outside traffic to news publishers. A year later it was down to 25 percent. Publishers that weren’t in the category “politics, crime, or tragedy” were hit much harder. Jake Rowland/Esto At WIRED, the month after an image of a bruised Zuckerberg appeared on the cover, the numbers were even more stark. One day, traffic from Facebook suddenly dropped by 90 percent, and for four weeks it stayed there. After protestations, emails, and a raised eyebrow or two about the coincidence, Facebook finally got to the bottom of it. An ad run by a liquor advertiser, targeted at WIRED readers, had been mistakenly categorized as engagement bait by the platform. In response, the algorithm had let all the air out of WIRED’s tires. The publication could post whatever it wanted, but few would read it. Once the error was identified, traffic soared back. It was a reminder that journalists are just sharecroppers on Facebook’s giant farm. And sometimes conditions on the farm can change without warning. Inside Facebook, of course, it was not surprising that traffic to publishers went down after the pivot to “meaningful social interactions.” That outcome was the point. It meant people would be spending more time on posts created by their friends and family, the genuinely unique content that Facebook offers. According to multiple Facebook employees, a handful of executives considered it a small plus, too, that the news industry was feeling a little pain after all its negative coverage. The company denies this—“no one at Facebook is rooting against the news industry,” says Anne Kornblut, the company’s director of news partnerships—but, in any case, by early May the pain seemed to have become perhaps excessive. A number of stories appeared in the press about the damage done by the algorithmic changes. And so Sheryl Sandberg, who colleagues say often responds with agitation to negative news stories, sent an email on May 7 calling a meeting of her top lieutenants. That kicked off a wide-ranging conversation that ensued over the next two months. The key question was whether the company should introduce new factors into its algorithm to help serious publications. The product team working on news wanted Facebook to increase the amount of public content—things shared by news organizations, businesses, celebrities—allowed in News Feed. They also wanted the company to provide stronger boosts to publishers deemed trustworthy, and they suggested the company hire a large team of human curators to elevate the highest-quality news inside of News Feed. The company discussed setting up a new section on the app entirely for news and directed a team to quietly work on developing it; one of the team’s ambitions was to try to build a competitor to Apple News. Some of the company’s most senior execs, notably Chris Cox, agreed that Facebook needed to give serious publishers a leg up. Others pushed back, especially Joel Kaplan, a former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush who was now Facebook’s vice president of global public policy. Supporting high-quality outlets would inevitably make it look like the platform was supporting liberals, which could lead to trouble in Washington, a town run mainly by conservatives. Breitbart and the Daily Caller, Kaplan argued, deserved protections too. At the end of the climactic meeting, on July 9, Zuckerberg sided with Kaplan and announced that he was tabling the decision about adding ways to boost publishers, effectively killing the plan. To one person involved in the meeting, it seemed like a sign of shifting power. Cox had lost and Kaplan had won. Either way, Facebook’s overall traffic to news organizations continued to plummet. VI.

That same evening, Donald Trump announced that he had a new pick for the Supreme Court: Brett Kavanaugh. As the choice was announced, Joel Kaplan stood in the background at the White House, smiling. Kaplan and Kavanaugh had become friends in the Bush White House, and their families had become intertwined. They had taken part in each other’s weddings; their wives were best friends; their kids rode bikes together. No one at Facebook seemed to really notice or care, and a tweet pointing out Kaplan’s attendance was retweeted a mere 13 times. Meanwhile, the dynamics inside the communications department had gotten even worse. Elliot Schrage had announced that he was going to leave his post as VP of global communications. So the company had begun looking for his replacement; it focused on interviewing candidates from the political world, including Denis McDonough and Lisa Monaco, former senior officials in the Obama administration. But Rachel Whetstone also declared that she wanted the job. At least two other executives said they would quit if she got it. The need for leadership in communications only became more apparent on July 11, when John Hegeman, the new head of News Feed, was asked in an interview why the company didn’t ban Alex Jones’ InfoWars from the platform. The honest answer would probably have been to just admit that Facebook gives a rather wide berth to the far right because it’s so worried about being called liberal. Hegeman, though, went with the following: “We created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice. And different publishers have very different points of view.” This, predictably, didn’t go over well with the segments of the news media that actually try to tell the truth and that have never, as Alex Jones has done, reported that the children massacred at Sandy Hook were actors. Public fury ensued. Most of Facebook didn’t want to respond. But Whetstone decided it was worth a try. She took to the @facebook account—which one executive involved in the decision called “a big fucking marshmallow we shouldn’t ever use like this”—and started tweeting at the company’s critics. “Sorry you feel that way,” she typed to one, and explained that, instead of banning pages that peddle false information, Facebook demotes them. The tweet was very quickly ratioed, a Twitter term of art for a statement that no one likes and that receives more comments than retweets. Whetstone, as @facebook, also declared that just as many pages on the left pump out misinformation as on the right. That tweet got badly ratioed too. Five days later, Zuckerberg sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher, the influential editor of Recode. Whetstone was in charge of prep. Before Zuckerberg headed to the microphone, Whetstone supplied him with a list of rough talking points, including one that inexplicably violated the first rule of American civic discourse: Don’t invoke the Holocaust while trying to make a nuanced point. About 20 minutes into the interview, while ambling through his answer to a question about Alex Jones, Zuckerberg declared, “I’m Jewish, and there’s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down, because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” Sometimes, Zuckerberg added, he himself makes errors in public statements. The comment was absurd: People who deny that the Holocaust happened generally aren’t just slipping up in the midst of a good-faith intellectual disagreement. They’re spreading anti-Semitic hate—intentionally. Soon the company announced that it had taken a closer look at Jones’ activity on the platform and had finally chosen to ban him. His past sins, Facebook decided, had crossed into the domain of standards violations. Eventually another candidate for the top PR job was brought into the headquarters in Menlo Park: Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the UK. Perhaps in an effort to disguise himself—or perhaps because he had decided to go aggressively Silicon Valley casual—he showed up in jeans, sneakers, and an untucked shirt. His interviews must have gone better than his disguise, though, as he was hired over the luminaries from Washington. “What makes him incredibly well qualified,” said Caryn Marooney, the company’s VP of communications, “is that he helped run a country.” Adam Maida VII.

At the end of July, Facebook was scheduled to report its quarterly earnings in a call to investors. The numbers were not going to be good; Facebook’s user base had grown more slowly than ever, and revenue growth was taking a huge hit from the company’s investments in hardening the platform against abuse. But in advance of the call, the company’s leaders were nursing an additional concern: how to put Insta­gram in its place. According to someone who saw the relevant communications, Zuckerberg and his closest lieutenants were debating via email whether to say, essentially, that Insta­gram owed its spectacular growth not primarily to its founders and vision but to its relationship with Facebook. Zuckerberg wanted to include a line to this effect in his script for the call. Whetstone counseled him not to, or at least to temper it with praise for Insta­gram’s founding team. In the end, Zuckerberg’s script declared, “We believe Insta­gram has been able to use Facebook’s infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own. A big congratulations to the Insta­gram team—and to all the teams across our company that have contributed to this success.” After the call—with its payload of bad news about growth and investment—Facebook’s stock dropped by nearly 20 percent. But Zuckerberg didn’t forget about Insta­gram. A few days later he asked his head of growth, Javier Olivan, to draw up a list of all the ways Facebook supported Insta­gram: running ads for it on the Blue App; including link-backs when someone posted a photo on Insta­gram and then cross-published it in Facebook News Feed; allowing Insta­gram to access a new user’s Facebook connections in order to recommend people to follow. Once he had the list, Zuckerberg conveyed to Insta­gram’s leaders that he was pulling away the supports. Facebook had given Insta­gram servers, health insurance, and the best engineers in the world. Now Insta­gram was just being asked to give a little back—and to help seal off the vents that were allowing people to leak away from the Blue App. Systrom soon posted a memo to his entire staff explaining Zuckerberg’s decision to turn off supports for traffic to Insta­gram. He disagreed with the move, but he was committed to the changes and was telling his staff that they had to go along. The memo “was like a flame going up inside the company,” a former senior manager says. The document also enraged Facebook, which was terrified it would leak. Systrom soon departed on paternity leave. The tensions didn’t let up. In the middle of August, Facebook prototyped a location-­tracking service inside of Insta­gram, the kind of privacy intrusion that Insta­gram’s management team had long resisted. In August, a hamburger menu appeared. “It felt very personal,” says a senior Insta­gram employee who spent the month implementing the changes. It felt particularly wrong, the employee says, because Facebook is a data-driven company, and the data strongly suggested that Insta­gram’s growth was good for everyone. The Instagram founders' unhappiness with Facebook stemmed from tensions that had brewed over many years and had boiled over in the past six months. Friends of Systrom and Krieger say the strife was wearing on the founders too. According to someone who heard the conversation, Systrom openly wondered whether Zuckerberg was treating him the way Donald Trump was treating Jeff Sessions: making life miserable in hopes that he’d quit without having to be fired. Insta­gram’s managers also believed that Facebook was being miserly about their budget. In past years they had been able to almost double their number of engineers. In the summer of 2018 they were told that their growth rate would drop to less than half of that. When it was time for Systrom to return from paternity leave, the two founders decided to make the leave permanent. They made the decision quickly, but it was far from impulsive. According to someone familiar with their thinking, their unhappiness with Facebook stemmed from tensions that had brewed over many years and had boiled over in the past six months. And so, on a Monday morning, Systrom and Krieger went into Chris Cox’s office and told him the news. Systrom and Krieger then notified their team about the decision. Somehow the information reached Mike Isaac, a reporter at The New York Times, before it reached the communications teams for either Facebook or Insta­gram. The story appeared online a few hours later, as Insta­gram’s head of communications was on a flight circling above New York City. After the announcement, Systrom and Krieger decided to play nice. Soon there was a lovely photograph of the two founders smiling next to Mosseri, the obvious choice to replace them. And then they headed off into the unknown to take time off, decompress, and figure out what comes next. Systrom and Krieger told friends they both wanted to get back into coding after so many years away from it. If you need a new job, it’s good to learn how to code. VIII.

Just a few days after Systrom and Krieger quit, Joel Kaplan roared into the news. His dear friend Brett Kavanaugh was now not just a conservative appellate judge with Federalist Society views on Roe v. Wade; he had become an alleged sexual assailant, purported gang rapist, and national symbol of toxic masculinity to somewhere between 49 and 51 percent of the country. As the charges multiplied, Kaplan’s wife, Laura Cox Kaplan, became one of the most prominent women defending him: She appeared on Fox News and asked, “What does it mean for men in the future? It’s very serious and very troubling.” She also spoke at an #IStandWithBrett press conference that was live­streamed on Breitbart. On September 27, Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee after four hours of wrenching recollections by his primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Laura Cox Kaplan sat right behind him as the hearing descended into rage and recrimination. Joel Kaplan sat one row back, stoic and thoughtful, directly in view of the cameras broadcasting the scene to the world. Kaplan isn’t widely known outside of Facebook. But he’s not anonymous, and he wasn’t wearing a fake mustache. As Kavanaugh testified, journalists started tweeting a screenshot of the tableau. At a meeting in Menlo Park, executives passed around a phone showing one of these tweets and stared, mouths agape. None of them knew Kaplan was going to be there. The man who was supposed to smooth over Facebook’s political dramas had inserted the company right into the middle of one. Kaplan had long been friends with Sandberg; they’d even dated as undergraduates at Harvard. But despite rumors to the contrary, he had told neither her nor Zuckerberg that he would be at the hearing, much less that he would be sitting in the gallery of supporters behind the star witness. “He’s too smart to do that,” one executive who works with him says. “That way, Joel gets to go. Facebook gets to remind people that it employs Republicans. Sheryl gets to be shocked. And Mark gets to denounce it.” If that was the plan, it worked to perfection. Soon Facebook’s internal message boards were lighting up with employees mortified at what Kaplan had done. Management’s initial response was limp and lame: A communications officer told the staff that Kaplan attended the hearing as part of a planned day off in his personal capacity. That wasn’t a good move. Someone visited the human resources portal and noted that he hadn’t filed to take the day off. What Facebook Fears In some ways, the world’s largest social network is stronger than ever, with record revenue of $55.8 billion in 2018. But Facebook has also never been more threatened. Here are some dangers that could knock it down.

US Antitrust Regulation

In March, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren proposed severing Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook, joining the growing chorus of people who want to chop the company down to size. Even US attorney general William Barr has hinted at probing tech’s “huge behemoths.” But for now, antitrust talk remains talk—much of it posted to Facebook.

Federal Privacy Crackdowns

Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission are negotiating a settlement over whether the company’s conduct, including with Cambridge Analytica, violated a 2011 consent decree regarding user privacy. According to The New York Times, federal prosecutors have also begun a criminal investigation into Facebook’s data-sharing deals with other technology companies.

European Regulators

While America debates whether to take aim at Facebook, Europe swings axes. In 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation forced Facebook to allow users to access and delete more of their data. Then this February, Germany ordered the company to stop harvesting web-browsing data without users’ consent, effectively outlawing much of the company’s ad business.

User Exodus

Although a fifth of the globe uses Facebook every day, the number of adult users in the US has largely stagnated. The decline is even more precipitous among teenagers. (Granted, many of them are switching to Instagram.) But network effects are powerful things: People swarmed to Facebook because everyone else was there; they might also swarm for the exits. The hearings were on a Thursday. A week and a day later, Facebook called an all-hands to discuss what had happened. The giant cafeteria in Facebook’s headquarters was cleared to create space for a town hall. Hundreds of chairs were arranged with three aisles to accommodate people with questions and comments. Most of them were from women who came forward to recount their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, and abuse. Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other members of management were standing on the right side of the stage, facing the audience and the moderator. Whenever a question was asked of one of them, they would stand up and take the mic. Kaplan appeared via video conference looking, according to one viewer, like a hostage trying to smile while his captors stood just offscreen. Another participant described him as “looking like someone had just shot his dog in the face.” This participant added, “I don’t think there was a single male participant, except for Zuckerberg looking down and sad onstage and Kaplan looking dumbfounded on the screen.” Employees who watched expressed different emotions. Some felt empowered and moved by the voices of women in a company where top management is overwhelmingly male. Another said, “My eyes rolled to the back of my head” watching people make specific personnel demands of Zuckerberg, including that Kaplan undergo sensitivity training. For much of the staff, it was cathartic. Facebook was finally reckoning, in a way, with the #MeToo movement and the profound bias toward men in Silicon Valley. For others it all seemed ludicrous, narcissistic, and emblematic of the liberal, politically correct bubble that the company occupies. A guy had sat in silence to support his best friend who had been nominated to the Supreme Court; as a consequence, he needed to be publicly flogged? In the days after the hearings, Facebook organized small group discussions, led by managers, in which 10 or so people got together to discuss the issue. There were tears, grievances, emotions, debate. “It was a really bizarre confluence of a lot of issues that were popped in the zit that was the SCOTUS hearing,” one participant says. Kaplan, though, seemed to have moved on. The day after his appearance on the conference call, he hosted a party to celebrate Kavanaugh’s lifetime appointment. Some colleagues were aghast. According to one who had taken his side during the town hall, this was a step too far. That was “just spiking the football,” they said. Sandberg was more forgiving. “It’s his house,” she told WIRED. “That is a very different decision than sitting at a public hearing.” In a year during which Facebook made endless errors, Kaplan’s insertion of the company into a political maelstrom seemed like one of the clumsiest. But in retrospect, Facebook executives aren’t sure that Kaplan did lasting harm. His blunder opened up a series of useful conversations in a workplace that had long focused more on coding than inclusion. Also, according to another executive, the episode and the press that followed surely helped appease the company’s would-be regulators. It’s useful to remind the Republicans who run most of Washington that Facebook isn’t staffed entirely by snowflakes and libs. IX.

That summer and early fall weren’t kind to the team at Facebook charged with managing the company’s relationship with the news industry. At least two product managers on the team quit, telling colleagues they had done so because of the company’s cavalier attitude toward the media. In August, a jet-lagged Campbell Brown gave a presentation to publishers in Australia in which she declared that they could either work together to create new digital business models or not. If they didn’t, well, she’d be unfortunately holding hands with their dying business, like in a hospice. Her off-the-­record comments were put on the record by The Australian, a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, a canny and persistent antagonist of Facebook. In September, however, the news team managed to convince Zuckerberg to start administering ice water to the parched executives of the news industry. That month, Tom Alison, one of the team’s leaders, circulated a document to most of Facebook’s senior managers; it began by proclaiming that, on news, “we lack clear strategy and alignment.” Then, at a meeting of the company’s leaders, Alison made a series of recommendations, including that Facebook should expand its definition of news—and its algorithmic boosts—beyond just the category of “politics, crime, or tragedy.” Stories about politics were bound to do well in the Trump era, no matter how Facebook tweaked its algorithm. But the company could tell that the changes it had introduced at the beginning of the year hadn’t had the intended effect of slowing the political venom pulsing through the platform. In fact, by giving a slight tailwind to politics, tragedy, and crime, Facebook had helped build a news ecosystem that resembled the front pages of a tempestuous tabloid. Or, for that matter, the front page of FoxNews.com. That fall, Fox was netting more engagement on Facebook than any other English-language publisher; its list of most-shared stories was a goulash of politics, crime, and tragedy. (The network’s three most-shared posts that month were an article alleging that China was burning bibles, another about a Bill Clinton rape accuser, and a third that featured Laura Cox Kaplan and #IStandWithBrett.) Politics, Crime, or Tragedy? In early 2018, Facebook’s algorithm started demoting posts shared by businesses and publishers. But because of an obscure choice by Facebook engineers, stories involving “politics, crime, or tragedy” were shielded somewhat from the blow—which had a big effect on the news ecosystem inside the social network. Source: Parse.ly That September meeting was a moment when Facebook decided to start paying indulgences to make up for some of its sins against journalism. It decided to put hundreds of millions of dollars toward supporting local news, the sector of the industry most disrupted by Silicon Valley; Brown would lead the effort, which would involve helping to find sustainable new business models for journalism. Alison proposed that the company move ahead with the plan hatched in June to create an entirely new section on the Facebook app for news. And, crucially, the company committed to developing new classifiers that would expand the definition of news beyond “politics, crime, or tragedy.” Zuckerberg didn’t sign off on everything all at once. But people left the room feeling like he had subscribed. Facebook had spent much of the year holding the media industry upside down by the feet. Now Facebook was setting it down and handing it a wad of cash. As Facebook veered from crisis to crisis, something else was starting to happen: The tools the company had built were beginning to work. The three biggest initiatives for the year had been integrating WhatsApp, Insta­gram, and the Blue App into a more seamless entity; eliminating toxic content; and refocusing News Feed on meaningful social interactions. The company was making progress on all fronts. The apps were becoming a family, partly through divorce and arranged marriage but a family nonetheless. Toxic content was indeed disappearing from the platform. In September, economists at Stanford and New York University revealed research estimating that user interactions with fake news on the platform had declined by 65 percent from their peak in December 2016 to the summer of 2018. On Twitter, meanwhile, the number had climbed. There wasn’t much time, however, for anyone to absorb the good news. Right after the Kavanaugh hearings, the company announced that, for the first time, it had been badly breached. In an Ocean’s 11–style heist, hackers had figured out an ingenious way to take control of user accounts through a quirk in a feature that makes it easier for people to play Happy Birthday videos for their friends. The breach was both serious and absurd, and it pointed to a deep problem with Facebook. By adding so many features to boost engagement, it had created vectors for intrusion. One virtue of simple products is that they are simpler to defend. X.

Given the sheer number of people who accused Facebook of breaking democracy in 2016, the company approached the November 2018 US midterm elections with trepidation. It worried that the tools of the platform made it easier for candidates to suppress votes than get them out. And it knew that Russian operatives were studying AI as closely as the engineers on Mike Schroepfer’s team. So in preparation for Brazil’s October 28 presidential election and the US midterms nine days later, the company created what it called “election war rooms”—a term despised by at least some of the actual combat veterans at the company. The rooms were partly a media prop, but still, three dozen people worked nearly around the clock inside of them to minimize false news and other integrity issues across the platform. Ultimately the elections passed with little incident, perhaps because Facebook did a good job, perhaps because a US Cyber Command operation temporarily knocked Russia’s primary troll farm offline. Facebook got a boost of good press from the effort, but the company in 2018 was like a football team that follows every hard-fought victory with a butt fumble and a 30-point loss. In mid-November, The New York Times published an impressively reported stem-winder about trouble at the company. The most damning revelation was that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm called Definers to investigate, among other things, whether George Soros was funding groups critical of the company. Definers was also directly connected to a dubious news operation whose stories were often picked up by Breitbart. After the story broke, Zuckerberg plausibly declared that he knew nothing about Definers. Sandberg, less plausibly, did the same. Numerous people inside the company were convinced that she entirely understood what Definers did, though she strongly maintains that she did not. Meanwhile, Schrage, who had announced his resignation but never actually left, decided to take the fall. He declared that the Definers project was his fault; it was his communications department that had hired the firm, he said. But several Facebook employees who spoke with WIRED believe that Schrage’s assumption of responsibility was just a way to gain favor with Sandberg. Inside Facebook, people were furious at Sandberg, believing she had asked them to dissemble on her behalf with her Definers denials. Sandberg, like everyone, is human. She’s brilliant, inspirational, and more organized than Marie Kondo. Once, on a cross-country plane ride back from a conference, a former Facebook executive watched her quietly spend five hours sending thank-you notes to everyone she’d met at the event—while everyone else was chatting and drinking. But Sandberg also has a temper, an ego, and a detailed memory for subordinates she thinks have made mistakes. For years, no one had a negative word to say about her. She was a highly successful feminist icon, the best-selling author of Lean In, running operations at one of the most powerful companies in the world. And she had done so under immense personal strain since her husband died in 2015. But resentment had been building for years, and after the Definers mess the dam collapsed. She was pummeled in the Times, in The Washington Post, on Breit­bart, and in WIRED. Former employees who had refrained from criticizing her in interviews conducted with WIRED in 2017 relayed anecdotes about her intimidation tactics and penchant for retribution in 2018. She was slammed after a speech in Munich. She even got dinged by Michelle Obama, who told a sold-out crowd at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 1, “It’s not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn’t work all the time.” Everywhere, in fact, it was becoming harder to be a Facebook employee. Attrition increased from 2017, though Facebook says it was still below the industry norm, and people stopped broadcasting their place of employment. The company’s head of cybersecurity policy was swatted in his Palo Alto home. “When I joined Facebook in 2016, my mom was so proud of me, and I could walk around with my Facebook backpack all over the world and people would stop and say, ‘It’s so cool that you worked for Facebook.’ That’s not the case anymore,” a former product manager says. “It made it hard to go home for Thanksgiving.” XI.

By the holidays in 2018, Facebook was beginning to seem like Monty Python’s Black Knight: hacked down to a torso hopping on one leg but still filled with confidence. The Alex Jones, Holocaust, Kaplan, hack, and Definers scandals had all happened in four months. The heads of WhatsApp and Insta­gram had quit. The stock price was at its lowest level in nearly two years. In the middle of that, Facebook chose to launch a video chat service called Portal. Reviewers thought it was great, except for the fact that Facebook had designed it, which made them fear it was essentially a spycam for people’s houses. Even internal tests at Facebook had shown that people responded to a description of the product better when they didn’t know who had made it. Two weeks later, the Black Knight lost his other leg. A British member of parliament named Damian Collins had obtained hundreds of pages of internal Facebook emails from 2012 through 2015. Ironically, his committee had gotten them from a sleazy company that helped people search for photos of Facebook users in bikinis. But one of Facebook’s superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic, no matter how absurd, into a media hero. And so, without much warning, Collins released them to the world. One of Facebook’s superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic, no matter how absurd, into a media hero. The emails, many of them between Zuckerberg and top executives, lent a brutally concrete validation to the idea that Facebook promoted growth at the expense of almost any other value. In one message from 2015, an employee acknowledged that collecting the call logs of Android users is a “pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective.” He said he could imagine the news stories about Facebook invading people’s private lives “in ever more terrifying ways.” But, he added, “it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it.” (It did.) Perhaps the most telling email is a message from a then executive named Sam Lessin to Zuckerberg that epitomizes Facebook’s penchant for self-justification. The company, Lessin wrote, could be ruthless and committed to social good at the same time, because they are essentially the same thing: “Our mission is to make the world more open and connected and the only way we can do that is with the best people and the best infrastructure, which requires that we make a lot of money / be very profitable.” The message also highlighted another of the company’s original sins: its assertion that if you just give people better tools for sharing, the world will be a better place. That’s just false. Sometimes Facebook makes the world more open and connected; sometimes it makes it more closed and disaffected. Despots and demagogues have proven to be just as adept at using Facebook as democrats and dreamers. Like the communications innovations before it—the printing press, the telephone, the internet itself—Facebook is a revolutionary tool. But human nature has stayed the same. XII.

Perhaps the oddest single day in Facebook’s recent history came on January 30, 2019. A story had just appeared on TechCrunch reporting yet another apparent sin against privacy: For two years, Facebook had been conducting market research with an app that paid you in return for sucking private data from your phone. Facebook could read your social media posts, your emoji sexts, and your browser history. Your soul, or at least whatever part of it you put into your phone, was worth up to $20 a month. Other big tech companies do research of this sort as well. But the program sounded creepy, particularly with the revelation that people as young as 13 could join with a parent’s permission. Worse, Facebook seemed to have deployed the app while wearing a ski mask and gloves to hide its fingerprints. Apple had banned such research apps from its main App Store, but Facebook had fashioned a workaround: Apple allows companies to develop their own in-house iPhone apps for use solely by employees—for booking conference rooms, testing beta versions of products, and the like. Facebook used one of these internal apps to disseminate its market research tool to the public. Apple cares a lot about privacy, and it cares that you know it cares about privacy. It also likes to ensure that people honor its rules. So shortly after the story was published, Apple responded by shutting down all of Facebook’s in-house iPhone apps. By the middle of that Wednesday afternoon, parts of Facebook’s campus stopped functioning. Applications that enabled employees to book meetings, see cafeteria menus, and catch the right shuttle bus flickered out. Employees around the world suddenly couldn’t communicate via messenger with each other on their phones. The mood internally shifted between outraged and amused—with employees joking that they had missed their meetings because of Tim Cook. Facebook’s cavalier approach to privacy had now poltergeisted itself on the company’s own lunch menus. But then something else happened. A few hours after Facebook’s engineers wandered back from their mystery meals, Facebook held an earnings call. Profits, after a months-long slump, had hit a new record. The number of daily users in Canada and the US, after stagnating for three quarters, had risen slightly. The stock surged, and suddenly all seemed well in the world. Inside a conference room called Relativity, Zuckerberg smiled and told research analysts about all the company’s success. At the same table sat Caryn Marooney, the company’s head of communications. “It felt like the old Mark,” she said. “This sense of ‘We’re going to fix a lot of things and build a lot of things.’ ” Employees couldn’t get their shuttle bus schedules, but within 24 hours the company was worth about $50 billion more than it had been worth the day before. SIGN UP TODAY Sign up for the Backchannel newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED. Less than a week after the boffo earnings call, the company gathered for another all-hands. The heads of security and ads spoke about their work and the pride they take in it. Nick Clegg told everyone that they had to start seeing themselves the way the world sees them, not the way they would like to be perceived. It seemed to observers as though management actually had its act together after a long time of looking like a man in lead boots trying to cross a lightly frozen lake. “It was a combination of realistic and optimistic that we hadn’t gotten right in two years,” one executive says. Soon it was back to bedlam, though. Shortly after the all-hands, a parliamentary committee in the UK published a report calling the company a bunch of “digital gangsters.” A German regulatory authority cracked down on a significant portion of the company’s ad business. And news broke that the FTC in Washington was negotiating with the company and reportedly considering a multibillion-­dollar fine due in part to Cambridge Analytica. Later, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren published a proposal to break Facebook apart. She promoted her idea with ads on Facebook, using a modified version of the company’s logo—an act specifically banned by Facebook’s terms of service. Naturally, the company spotted the violation and took the ads down. Warren quickly denounced the move as censorship, even as Facebook restored the ads. It was the perfect Facebook moment for a new year. By enforcing its own rules, the company had created an outrage cycle about Facebook—inside of a larger outrage cycle about Facebook. XIII.

HOUSTON, TEXAS — A man fought for his life against not one, not two, but five armed men who broke into his home. This gun owner was prepared for a fight, and utilized his AK-47 to defend his home and his life.

Two masked men went into the home where the 20-year-old resident was. At first, he though it was a joke, but quickly realized that these armed men meant business.

When they demanded cash, the resident complied. At least, that’s what he wanted them to believe. He said that he was going for what they wanted and reached under the couch.

Instead of pulling out money, he instead pulled out his AK-47 and began shooting at the suspects.

Three of the men were killed, and the other two were injured. Both injured suspects were taken to the hospital and then arrested.

The defender pursued the invaders into the front yard. The pile of brass in the front yard has been described as being from several different guns. The defender continued the gunfight with three occupants of the car that delivered the two home invaders. The group fled the scene in the car. The car crashed a couple of blocks away. One suspect was found in the car, dead. One wounded suspect was found at Capitol and 71st Street, he was the suspect that died at the hospital. The third suspect from the car was wounded, fled the scene, and was being treated in the hospital.

The resident was not wounded during the incident, and police do not expect any charges to be filed. What this 20-year-old did was something that couldn’t be done unarmed, and he very well could have saved his own life that day.

He showed skill, and maintained his cool under pressure. His approach of pretend compliance is what made this self-defense as successful as it was, by completely catching his aggressors off guard, even though it was their full intention to catch their target victim in the same manner.
The teachers were holding a meeting demanding the release of nine activists arrested last year on charges of association with the Communist Party of India (Maoist)

Several human rights activists and teachers, including educationist G. Haragopal, were detained by State police forces in the Indian city of Hyderabad on April 13. The incident took place after the police obstructed a meeting conducted by the Democratic Teachers’ Federation in the city. The meeting was organized to demand the release from jail of activists and public intellectuals, including Varavara Rao and Sudha Bharadwaj, among others.

Last year, police in the city of Pune arrested nine activists – Sudha Bharadwaj, Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Surendra Pundlik Gadling, Sudhir Pralhad Dhawale, Rona Jacob Wilson, Soma Sen and Mahesh Sitaram Raut. They were accused of links with the outlawed Communist Party of India (Maoist). They were booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 for what the police said was their role in the Bhima Koregaon case.

Bhima Koregaon is a place in Maharashtra where an army comprising primarily Dalits (the former untouchable castes) defeated the upper caste Peshwa armies in 1818. On January 31, 2018, an event was held to mark the anniversary of the battle. This event was attacked by right-wing Hindu elements and riots took place over the next couple of days in the city. The leaders of Hindu right-wing organization identified as the instigators of this violence continue to roam free. However, the nine activists, many of whom were not even in Pune when the incident occurred, were arrested in connection with the riots under UAPA and were alleged to have links with the Maoists.

The UAPA, a draconian, overreaching law, has often been used an instrument of suppression by the Indian state for the purpose of silencing dissent. The case against the nine activists has been condemned for the flimsy evidence and procedural lapses.

Revolutionary Writers’ Association (Virasam) has condemned the obstruction of the meeting and the arrest of the teachers as undemocratic and an inhuman act by the State government of Telangana, where Hyderabad is located. “It is shameful to disrupt an indoor meeting of teachers who want to speak about the incarceration of fellow teachers like Varavara Rao, Saibaba, Shoma Sen and other intellectuals,” Virasam said in a statement.

They have also demanded the immediate release of the activists.

Sources who were present at the spot told NewsClick that the police locked the doors of NGO Bhavan, where the meeting was being held, and used barricades to stop hundreds of teachers from taking part.

P Viswa Prasad, deputy commissioner of police (Central Zone), Hyderabad, said over the phone, “It was not an arrest but preventive detention.” When questioned as to why an indoor meeting was obstructed, Prasad refused to provide an answer.
SALT LAKE CITY — It was like a scene out of a horror movie.

The Notre Dame Cathedral was suddenly ablaze on Monday, the flames dancing in front of the darkening Paris sky.

Firefighters saved the majority of the structure, except for its world-famous spire, which collapsed into the remains of the cathedral that draws more than 13 million visitors a year and 30,000 people a day.

No one was injured. Patrons gathered outside the church to sing hymns, including “Ave Maria,” a mournful melody highlighting the ironic twist of fate that such devastating damage should occur during Holy Week, the days of Christian religious celebration leading up to Easter.

But the stunning conflagration raises questions for other major architectural structures with religious significance, including those in Utah, such as the Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which draws more than 3 million to 5 million visitors each year.

The church is scheduled to detail lengthy renovation and retrofitting plans for the temple on Friday, and as Notre Dame burned it brought clearly into focus the need for care during what firefighters say can be a particularly dangerous time for historical structures.

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Provo City firefighters respond to a large fire at the historic Provo Tabernacle. Friday, Dec. 17, 2010.

"We make every effort to protect our historical facilities from fire or any damage," church Presiding Bishop Gérald Caussé told the Church News Monday. Bishop Caussé, a native of France, watched with sadness as he and his wife, Valerie, noted the devoted sacrifice of so many over the centuries to build such a grand cathedral for worship in Paris.

"Because renovation work may put our historic facilities at greater risk, we use fire prevention plans. These plans typically include 24-hour fire watch, fire suppression systems and extinguishers placed strategically around the facility, and extensive training of staff and workers."

Is Salt Lake City prepared to protect not just the temple, but Utah's other historic structures, such as the Cathedral of the Madeleine, the Utah Capitol and the Salt Lake City-County Building?

The Deseret News spoke to fire and emergency management officials in Utah about fire lessons learned from similar fires in Utah history, at the Provo Tabernacle and the Governor's Mansion, which burned when a Christmas tree caught fire in 1993. Just what hazards still keep them up at night?

Creating a fire safety habit

Utah fire officials say there are procedures already in place to prepare for and respond to a fire at one of the state’s historic buildings.

“We’ve done our best to make sure these buildings have the latest and best resources available to them as far as fire prevention,” said Salt Lake City Fire Capt. Adam Archuleta.

The Utah Capitol boasts a sophisticated fire prevention program, with a fire alarm system, eight sprinkler zones throughout the building and a smoke evacuation system, in addition to other measures, according to Allyson Gamble, executive director of the Utah Capitol Preservation Board.

Deseret News Archives The Utah Capitol underwent renovation in 2007 in Salt Lake City, Utah, as seen from above in this file photo from March 15, 2007.

The Salt Lake Temple has its own large underground water supply to supplement the city’s underground water supply in case of a fire, said Archuleta.

In the event of a fire at the Salt Lake Temple, the Salt Lake City Fire Department has a plan in place to immediately deploy enough firefighters and firetrucks to the scene, he said. Instead of the department sending a standard three engines and one truck, he said it would send six fire engines and five trucks at a minimum as an initial response.

“We would have upward of 50 firefighters there within the first 10 minutes or so,” said Archuleta. “This would give us a huge advantage, and at that point we could expand as necessary.”

Citizens also have a role to play in fire prevention and safety, said Joe Dougherty, spokesman for the Utah Division of Emergency Management.

“They should have an idea of where the exits are, where my alternate exit is going to be if I can’t use my primary exit,” he said. “And that works whether you are a patron of the temple, or you are attending a church of another religion. If you're in a public building or you are in your own home, you need to identify the exit out of every room. If we build that type of habit, we’ll make sure that we are going to be as safe as possible when we’re in a public space.”

Learning from the past

Questions prompted by the Notre Dame fire about Utah’s historic buildings are not merely theoretical.

In December 1993, a fire caused by faulty wiring on the Christmas tree in the Utah Governor’s Mansion gutted the ornate building, requiring a long and painstaking renovation to restore the mansion’s historical interior.

And in 2010, the Provo Tabernacle experienced a major fire, ignited by a lighting technician who mistakenly set a 300-watt light fixture on a wooden speaker box in the attic, according to a Provo Fire Department report. The fire cost $15 million in damage, and the building had to be completely renovated.

Archuleta remembers the Provo Tabernacle fire clearly. The fire was a “historical loss because the building was integrated into the history of the community," he said. It was rebuilt, however, into a second church temple for Provo, saving as much of the original building as possible.

Deseret News Archives Firefighters use bolt cutters to open the front gates as smoke pours from the second floor of the Governor's Mansion in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday morning, Dec. 16, 1993.

“It was a place where people congregate and it was a place where people had, for all intents and purposes, spiritual life-changing experiences. So the building itself, yes, it was just brick and mortar to an extent, but that represents the values of the community.”

While the losses associated with house fires can be traumatic and emotional for individuals and families, the structures themselves can be somewhat easily, cheaply and quickly rebuilt, Archuleta said.

Not so with historic buildings.

“The cathedral or the City-County Building or the Provo Temple, these are landmark structures that simply cannot be replaced,” he said. “They could be rebuilt to an extent,but nothing like they were originally. So we consider that when we’re making our fire tactics and strategies.”

Sometimes, he said, firefighters themselves can be affected by the emotional nature of battling fires that consume structures with great historical or religious significance.

“Make no mistake, everybody is aware of what the staples of the (Utah) community are from a religious standpoint,” said Archuleta. “However, it’s our obligation as firefighters to remove as much of the emotion as possible once we engage in a firefight.

“It’s a testament to the humanity of the firefighters that you have the ability to just remove yourself for a moment, to make the most logical and rational decisions based off of standard firefighting procedures and tactics,” he continued. “Afterward is when you’re going to have that emotional investment and effect."

‘The greatest danger is during construction’

Firefighters use the term "target hazards" to describe historic structures that could be especially vulnerable to fires, meaning that there is something about those particular buildings that presents unique risks.

For the Cathedral of the Madeleine or the Salt Lake Temple, he said one of those hazards has to do with the sheer volume of people that visit the buildings at all hours of the day and night, requiring fire officials to have enough firefighters and resources available to fight a fire there anytime.

" The greatest danger is during construction. " Brad Larson, Fire Marshall with the Unified Fire Authority

But the buildings themselves also present fire-safety hazards, said Brad Larson, fire marshall with the Unified Fire Authority.

"The greatest danger is during construction," he said.

Much attention has been drawn to the fact that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire occurred while the building was undergoing $6.8 million in renovations.

Fires are common during building renovations, according to Matthew McFarland, spokesperson for the Unified Fire Authority.

Sometimes that’s because during construction a building’s power may be shut off, resulting in a disconnection or compromising of a building’s fire alarm system, he said. Construction might also cause the exposure of wood or other materials to open wires, welding or propane heaters used to keep space warm in the winter.

That’s why construction companies are required by state law to have a “rigid” fire prevention program, said Larson.

Laura Seitz, Deseret News Artwork in the rotunda was cleaned and restored at the Utah state Capitol in Salt Lake City on Dec. 21, 2007. The paintings around the dome are from 1935 and illustrate scenes from Utah's history.

Besides the risks of construction, older buildings themselves can be especially prone to fires — sometimes deceptively so, said Archuleta.

Gamble, with the Utah Capitol Preservation Board, said the Utah Capitol was designed with fire suppression in mind when it was built in 1916.

Rather than wood, the Capitol was primarily built of concrete and steel, with a wood facade painted by artists on the interior of the building. The building is now equipped with sophisticated sprinkler systems and other fire prevention measures.

But fire experts say even when the exterior of the building is made of a solid, non-highly flammable material, it can still be highly vulnerable to its interior contents made of modern materials, specifically the use of synthetic materials to furnish the building, such as carpets and furniture.

And when buildings have been renovated several times, each renovation brings more and more “void spaces,” where old plumbing and electrical wiring has been removed, leaving areas of space in the walls, Archuleta said.

“Fire can travel between the walls," he said. "So even when we think we have a handle on the origin area of the fire, the fire may be spreading all around us without us even being aware of it."

Correction: An earlier version stated the Provo Tabernacle fire occurred in 2011. It was in 2010. It also incorrectly stated the number of visitors to the Salt Lake Temple was more than all five of the state's national parks combined. National Park Service figures show the five parks collectively drew more than 10 million visitors in 2018. It also stated the Salt Lake City-County Building is gothic in style. It is Richardsonian Romanesque.
A fire brigade chaplain who ran inside the burning Notre Dame Cathedral to save precious relics has a history of heroic actions.

Father Jean-Marc Fournier rushed inside the cathedral to save several sacred religious artifacts Monday, including the Crown of Thorns. Fournier was also one of the first people to rush inside the Bataclan theater during the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. (RELATED: The Vatican Releases Statement On Notre Dame Fire)

Eighty-nine people died in the theater in 2015 during the Eagles of Death Metal concert, when Fournier rushed inside to pray for the dead and comfort the wounded.

“He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear,” an emergency services source reportedly told The Daily Mail.

The Daily Mail also reports that while serving as a chaplain for the Army, Fournier survived an ambush in Afghanistan that killed 10 soldiers.

Steven T. Mnuchin is the 77th Secretary of the Treasury. Prior to his confirmation, Secretary Mnuchin was Finance Chairman for Donald J. Trump for President. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Americans just finished filing their taxes for 2018. And this is the first year that the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) have been improving the lives of our citizens. In fact, we are pleased to report that we have experienced a year of more jobs, bigger paychecks, increased business investment and lower tax liability.

Lower tax rates, higher standard deductions and larger child tax credits have benefited most Americans. According to Treasury's analysis, in 2017, a typical American household earning $75,000 in pre-tax wages was paying $3,983 in federal income taxes. Each month, $347 was withheld from their paychecks, and they received a $178 refund when they filed their 2017 taxes. In 2018, that typical family earning $75,000 saw their total taxes fall to just $1,739, a tax reduction of $2,244 per family. The tax cut was mostly realized through the nearly $200 per month added to their paychecks. They are also receiving a $41 refund, which means that instead of overpaying the government, they were able to keep more of their hard-earned money every month.

According to recent data released by H&R Block , their clients saw their taxes decline by 24.9% on average. As the company explained, average tax refunds are up just 1.4% for their customers because 96% of the reduction "went into paychecks during the year." They also found that for their customers, "all 50 states and D.C. saw their average tax liability decrease anywhere from 18.0 percent to 29.1 percent."

Additionally, per the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, about 80% of American taxpayers were estimated to see their federal taxes decline as a result of the tax reforms that we have implemented. This means that more than 140 million American families are likely experiencing federal tax savings because of the TCJA.

Americans also saw large wage gains in 2018 as a result of the stimulus to economic activity generated by the TCJA, combined with the Trump administration's deregulatory activities of the past two years.

Over the eight years prior to President Donald Trump taking office, American wage gains were minimal, rising 2.1% on average and less than 0.4% per year, after accounting for inflation. Those days of stagnation are over. Americans are once again starting to see meaningful real wage increases, particularly among low-wage workers.

During 2018, nominal wages grew 3.3% and 1.3% accounting for inflation, increasing the buying power of American families. Based on average wage growth and Treasury's analysis, the typical family who made $75,000 in 2017 saw their income rise to about $77,500 by the end of 2018. Even though they made more money, their federal income taxes declined $1,947. Depending upon the state they live in, that means this typical American family could be earning as much as $4,000 more in after tax income at the end of 2018 than they had in 2017. Prior to enactment of the tax bill, we estimated that families would see thousands of dollars more in their pockets, and I am very happy to report that we are seeing that come to fruition.

Americans' retirement accounts and education savings accounts are also benefiting from the improved economic environment. Since Election Day 2016, holdings in US equity markets have increased by over 35%.

Our growing economy has improved the retirement security of our retirees and provided more money for parents across the nation to provide for the education needs of their children. This reaffirms our fundamental belief that when the economy grows, the benefits extend across our society.

Not only are American families who were working in 2017 seeing higher incomes as a result of tax reform, but also more Americans are working because the TCJA has incentivized industry to invest in the United States.

Workforce participation among prime-age workers stands near its highest level in almost a decade, and for the first time since at least 2001, there are more job openings than Americans looking for work.

The TCJA incentivized investments in equipment and intellectual capital that will continue to improve the productivity of American workers. When Americans are more productive, they are better compensated. Today's capital investments are the foundation of tomorrow's additional wage gains.

The American economy is stronger today than it was before the TCJA. Business and consumer optimism has returned. Capital investment is increasing. Americans are returning to the workforce, and consumers have more money in their pockets. Entrepreneurs are once again finding an environment that rewards their creativity and dynamism. President Trump's economic program is leading to more jobs and higher wages for hardworking Americans.

The U.S. Air Force has sent F-35A Joint Strike Fighters on their first-ever operational deployment to the Middle East. The arrival of stealthy fighter jets to the region comes after the service decided to pull its F-22 Raptor stealth fighters from the region for the first time in years. It also follows a successful first combat outing for Marine F-35Bs, which involved strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as well as sorties in Afghanistan against the Taliban. An unspecified number of F-35As touched down at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, an important base for the United States in the region, on Apr. 15, 2019, according to an official press release. The aircraft, as well as maintenance and support personnel, came from both the active duty 388th Fighter Wing and the Air Force Reserve 419th Fighter Wing, both of which are based at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. The two units began making their way to the Middle East last week, according to another official news item. In November 2018, they had also taken part in a massive readiness exercise, or "Elephant Walk," involving 35 F-35As taking off in rapid succession.

“We are adding a cutting edge weapons system to our arsenal that significantly enhances the capability of the coalition [fighting ISIS],” U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), said in a statement. “The sensor fusion and survivability this aircraft provides to the joint force will enhance security and stability across the theater and deter aggressors.” The Air Force has previously deployed the F-35A operationally to Europe and the Pacific region, but they did not take part in any active conflicts in those theaters. The service said it had reached initial operational capability with the type in 2016.

In the Middle East, it seems very likely that the F-35As will quickly find themselves flying sorties against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Marine F-35Bs from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Group previously conducted strikes against militants in those two countries during a deployment that wrapped up in February 2019. Some of the Air Force's Joint Strike Fighters may make additional deployments further on to Afghanistan, to take part in the ongoing conflict there. The Marine F-35Bs had flown to that country and conducted their first-ever strikes against the Taliban in September 2018, which were also the first strikes any American F-35s from any service had ever conducted.

April 16, 2019 | Special Edition CHRISTOPHER HOLMAN After the Fire: Here's What We Know About the Organs at Notre Dame de Paris

Following the tremendous fire at the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the evening of April 15, much speculation and rumors have surrounded the state of the famous Grand Organ. At first, it seemed all hope was lost when at 1:00 A.M. on April 16, L'Obs reported that the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Paris, Msgr. Benoist de Sinety, proclaimed that the main organ was "practically totally destroyed." Shortly thereafter, Thomas Monnet relayed organ technician Éric Brottier's signifigantly conflicting initial assessment of the Grand Organ via phone (published on Concert Classic):

"The first observations on the instrument [the Grand Organ] of Notre Dame, including in the interior, show that the organ did not visibly (I emphasize that word) suffer extensively from the fire. It has been preserved from water thanks to a covering between the towers, and has not suffered from heat (the pipes are structurally preserved). This reassuring information will have to be supported by an in-depth examination which has not yet taken place."

​ Thankfully, Msgr. de Sinety's initial statement turned out to be the error (which L'Obs has now corrected), and correspondence from both Vincent Dubois and Philippe Lefebvre (published in La Lettre du Musicien and on Orgue en France's Facebook page) confirms that the Grand Organ has been mostly spared, though the Choir Organ suffered significant damage. The latest and most credible information about the state of the organs from the Organists of Notre Dame themselves are translated as follows: From Vincent Dubois (with the first mention of the Choir Organ): ​

"Contrary to rumors that have circulated all morning, the Grand Organ is, at the moment, saved. There are some puddles left and right, but nothing dramatic. The façade was spared, and the pipes ... it's miraculous. We were in contact all night with my colleagues Olivier Latry and Philippe Lefebvre and we had lost hope. It was the slab of stone that connects the two towers that saved the instrument: there is no frame at this point on the roof: the water from the firefighters flowed down both sides and did not fall on the organ case. However, if the vaults of the nave, which are now very fragile, are not quickly reinforced, it is likely that the organ will be dismantled and a workshop large enough to shelter it will be found. None exists in the region of Paris. The challenge is to determine, very quickly, if the keystones will withstand the weight of water and molten lead that has spilled. The choir organ did not burn either, but it was, however, completely drowned in water. It will be necessary to see what remains of it ... It will be necessary to wait years before being able to replay this instrument, but the essential thing was that it did not end up in ashes. We will be patient and will take action toward rehabilitation once it has been examined closely."

And from Philippe Lefebvre:

​“After the stupor and the dread, the unbearable sadness, and the devastating images of this tragedy: the Great Lady has valiantly withstood the worst — Notre Dame is still standing. Thank you for your well wishes, your testimonies of friendship, and solidarity. “It is confirmed that, for the moment, the Grand Organ has escaped disaster. No melted pipes, but a lot of dust, particles, soot, etc. Water, of course, but no flooding. “It will require more in-depth expertise to measure the extent of the damage. The Choir Organ has been doused in water and it is undoubtedly more damaged than the Grand Organ. “Everyone’s fears are now focused on the structure, and the medium-term consequences: will there be more falling debris, will the vault collapse? And when everything dries, will other elements disintegrate, causing other damage, etc.? “The organists hope to be authorized to go up to the loft in the coming days. It is hoped that as soon as the building is secure and builders are allowed to work there, we can proceed to safeguard the remaining parts of the two organs that can be saved, and evacuate and protect what remains.”

A former technology worker for the House of Representatives accused of data theft by conservative news outlets pleaded guilty on Tuesday to an unrelated charge of making false statements on a loan application.

The worker, Imran Awan, 38, was arrested last summer as he tried to board a flight to Pakistan. He had been at the center of a swirl of allegations that he and several associates had conspired to steal hardware, data and perhaps even Democratic National Committee emails published by WikiLeaks.

President Trump had tried to heighten the intrigue, posting tweets claiming a media cover-up of a “Democrat I.T. scandal” and referring to Mr. Awan as a “Pakistani mystery man.”

JEFFERSON PARK — Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza Monday blasted State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office for allowing a man she caught barreling through a red light and smashing into four parked cars before fleeing the scene to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and serve no jail time.

Mendoza was out for a bicycle ride in September 2017 with her family when a black truck driven by John Boyle barreled through a Far Northwest Side intersection and struck four cars before driving away, as first reported by the Tribune.

Mendoza caught up with the man, and recorded him before he fled again.

Mendoza gave the video to police, and Boyle turned himself in several days later.

“I am disappointed that ‘Quarters’ Boyle received no jail time after he recklessly caused a 4-car accident two years ago,” Mendoza said in a statement released by her state office. “His conviction today for fleeing the scene is better than nothing. But the innocent drivers in those cars he hit deserved more justice.”

Mendoza said she encouraged Foxx’s office to charge Boyle with DUI, reckless driving, battery or with impersonating a police officer.

In a statement, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office said “the evidence related to this case and the law did not support a felony charge.”

Boyle was sentenced to 12 months conditional discharge, must attend a victim impact panel, and pay a $500 fine as well as $424 in court fees and costs, according to the state’s attorney’s office.

That “resolution was appropriate for this traffic offense,” according to the state’s attorney’s office

Boyle was convicted in 1992 of embezzling millions of dollars in nickels, dimes and quarters from the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, earning the nickname “Quarters.”

Despite that conviction, Boyle was hired by the city in 1997 and oversaw the city’s Hired Truck program, which became embroiled in scandal. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to extorting bribes as part of the investigation into the program.

Mendoza’s criticism of Foxx comes after the state’s attorney has been harshly criticized for her office’s decision to drop all charges against Jussie Smollett, who had been accused of filing a false report of a hate crime.
Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story is casting up with over 40 performers set as Sharks and Jets, the rival street gangs at the center of the musical’s timeless love story. Leading the Jets as Riff will be Mike Faist, who is best known for originating roles in the Broadway productions of Dear Evan Hansen and Newsies. Also, Puerto Rican singer and dancer Ana Isabelle will play Rosalia, who works with Maria (played by newcomer Rachel Zegler). Dance Moms alum Maddie Ziegler has also been cast as part of the Jets.

Previously announced players include Rita Moreno (Valentina), Ansel Elgort (Tony), Ariana DeBose (Anita), David Alvarez (Bernardo), Josh Andrés Rivera (Chino), Corey Stoll (Lieutenant Schrank), and Brian dʼArcy James (Sergeant Krupke).

Spielberg’s team conducted a wide search for performers, many with no on-camera experience, to bring together a cast with a range of musical theater experience. Filming is slated to begin this summer.

The Sharks and Jets appear in several of West Side Story’s most iconic song and dance scenes, including “Cool,” “America,” “Gee, Officer Krupke,” “Jet Song” and “I Feel Pretty.” Justin Peck will choreograph the numbers in the film.

“One of our largest priorities was to find a caliber of triple-threats who could bring this film to life with great proficiency,” said Peck. “West Side Story has influenced generations of dancers since its inception, and I am thrilled that we have found this extraordinary group to bring our new vision for the musical to the big screen.”

In addition to Faist and Ziegler, the Jets chorus includes Brianna Abruzzo, Kyle Allen, Kyle Coffman, Ben Cook, Harrison Coll, Kevin Csolak, Kellie Drobnick, Julian Elia, Myles Erlick, Leigh-Ann Esty, Sara Esty, John Michael Fiumara, Paloma Garcia-Lee, Garett Hawe, Patrick Higgins, Sean Harrison Jones, Eloise Kropp, Lauren Leach, Jess LeProtto, Skye Mattox, Ezra Menas, Adriana Pierce, Brittany Pollack, Daniel Patrick Russell, Talia Ryder, Jonalyn Saxer, and Halli Toland.

Rounding out the members of the Sharks are David Aviles Morales, Yesenia Ayala, María Alejandra Castillo, Annelise Cepero, Andrei Chagas, Jeanette Delgado, Kelvin Delgado, Gaby Diaz, Yurel Echezarreta, Adriel Flete, Carlos E. Gonzalez, David Guzman, Jacob Guzman, Ana Isabelle, Melody Martí, Ilda Mason, Juliette Feliciano Ortiz, Edriz E. Rosa Pérez, Maria Alexis Rodriguez, Julius Anthony Rubio, Carlos Sánchez Falú, Sebastian Serra , Gabriela Soto, Ricky Ubeda, Tanairi Vazquez, Jamila Velazquez, Isabella Ward, and Ricardo Zayas.

Spielberg is producing and directing this latest rendition of West Side Story for 20th Century Fox. Oscar nominee and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner is adapting the screenplay from the original 1957 Broadway musical, which was written by Arthur Laurents with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and concept, direction and choreography by Jerome Robbins. Producers are Tony Award nominee Kevin McCollum and Oscar nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger.
The Fall of BioWare

Estimated reading time: 28 minutes, 39 seconds

BioWare is, perhaps more than any other game developer, famed for fantastic writing and storytelling. Games like 2003's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) and 2007's Mass Effect (ME1) cemented that status. Those were nearly legendary games that, while perhaps falling short in the combat/gameplay departments, told such great stories, and gave us such richly-developed characters, that we simply didn't care. That reputation was cemented by other games, such as Baldur's Gate and Jade Empire. So, BioWare has this great storytelling reputation. Or, at least, the studio was known for great stories and writing. That doesn't appear to be true any more, and has been less and less true as time has passed. You can almost follow the downfall of BioWare's ability to write stories well by looking at their releases since Mass Effect. Their storytelling ability seems to be getting progressively worse.

Let's start with ME1's successor game, Mass Effect 2.

The apex of BioWare's ability?

Mass Effect 2 (2010)

The overall story arc of the Mass Effect series is that an ancient race of intelligent machines, the Reapers, have returned to the galaxy every 50,000 years to destroy all advanced organic life, then retreated to the intergalactic "dark space" between these cycles of extinction. We are told that this cycle has repeated for millions upon millions of years. Indeed, in ME2, one mission takes us the husk of a Reaper ship that is 37 million years old.

In ME2, we are led to believe that there is a mysterious alien race, the Collectors, who are kidnapping entire human settlements on colony worlds, and that they are allied with the Reapers. The kidnappings, therefore, are tied to some unknown Reaper plot to return and end this cycle with yet another genocide of all technologically advanced species.

ME2 is perhaps the most popular installment in the ME trilogy, but the main story has a number of significant weaknesses.

They killed the protagonist, Commander Shepard, in the prologue scene, then magically resurrected him (or her, depending on who you've decided to play as Shepard) during the opening credits. The resurrection story line was completely unbelievable, and handled only with some technological hand-waving that explained nothing. He was dead for two years, but now he isn't. Okay, but unless there's some serious character development story line going on, you don't kill a protagonist in the opening scene of story then resurrect him in the second scene, especially without some serious exposition. That's just bad writing.

The story retconned the lore. In ME1, none of the guns required ammo reloading. Instead guns used cooldowns when they overheated. For ME2, BioWare introduced the idea of thermal clips that you ejected and replaced when the gun overheated. In other words, an ammunition reloading analog. In Shepard's resurrection scene, he is directed to pick up a pistol, after which he says, "This gun has no thermal clips." How does Shepard, who has been dead for two years, know about thermal clips? He died years earlier in a world where guns had cooldowns. Amusingly, there is a possible scene available in ME3 with the Conrad Verner character. He openly scoffs at the idea of thermal clips. Apparently, even BioWare thought this was a bad idea.

Speaking of retcons, the end of the story introduces a human-shaped Reaper as the final boss. All of the other Reapers look like giant squids, but this one is different for some reason. Why? Who knows? It was never explained. But the last scene of the game shows a massive Reaper fleet headed for the galaxy, all of which look like the canonical squid-shaped Reapers we've seen previously in the series. The final boss of ME2 was the only non-squid Reaper. Whatever. Also, the method of creating this human-shaped Reaper is to melt people into goo, and inject the goo into the embryonic Reaper to make it grow. We are told that this is somehow preserving the essence of humanity in Reaper form. How being melted into goo preserves this essence is also left unexplained.

We knew nothing about the Collectors, other than that they resided beyond the Omega relay, through which no non-Collector ship had ever returned. During the story, did we collect any intelligence about the Collectors, as you would expect a military force to do before engaging any enemy? Nope. We had no idea what was beyond the Omega relay. They could've had an empire of a thousand planets and a fleet of millions of ships, for all we knew. But the story expects us to believe the solution was that a team of 12 guys on your ship, the SSV Normandy, could solve the problem, based on no intelligence about the Collectors at all. We didn't even fire a probe beyond the relay to see what would happen. At one point, Shepard tells his employer, the Illusive Man, "If I'm going to take down the Collectors, I'm going to need an army. Or a really good team." Those two alternatives are...not equivalent. In the story, we just jump in blind, with no knowledge whatsoever of what we're facing, and just hope for the best. My 10 years of active military service are long behind me, but I seem to remember everybody making kind of big deal out of reconnaissance and intelligence.

ME2, despite the silliness, retcons, and inconsistencies of the main story, was saved by a much-improved combat system compared to ME1, as well as brilliant characterizations, and some great side missions. All of the various characters on the team seemed like real people, and, moreover, were people you wanted to know, to converse with, and ultimately, romance. There were some downsides to the gameplay, like the boring scanning missions to collect resources, but overall the game was fun, the characters lovable, and mission and level design were generally outstanding. It's certainly the most fun of the ME series to play, but the overall story had problems. Happily, there was enough good writing and characterization elsewhere to make the game engaging.

Finally, in ME2, we are introduced to the idea that there is some troubling problem arising from dark energy in the galaxy. One of our missions to recruit a squad member takes place on the planet Haestrom, whose sun has dramatically increased its output and is frying the planet. Why? Dark energy. We have some conversations about this dark energy problem in another mission, and, in other parts of the game, overhear some conversations about corporations and governments looking into dark energy for mysterious reasons. Foreshadowing? Well, we'll see.

Mass Effect 3

There's only one thing you need to talk about with ME3. We could talk about a lot, but one thing overshadows everything else that might be wrong. ME3's ending was bad that people still reference it, seven years later. It's not just bad, then, it's famously bad.

ME3 had fundamental writing problems with an ending that completely subverted the entire narrative of the entire Mass Effect series. What is the point of the long series of extinction cycles the Reapers have imposed on the galaxy for millions of years? The ending of ME3 explained that Reapers created the cycle because "Synthetics will always destroy their creators." According to the Reapers, organic races will inevitably create synthetic, artifically-intelligent beings. It will then follow, as the night follows the day, that the synthetic beings will kill their creators. It is, according to the Reapers, an immutable and eternal proposition.

This is seriously problematic. We know it's problematic, because the story tells us so.

We were introduced to a synthetic species in ME1 called the Geth, an advanced AI species created by an alien race known as the Quarians. The Quarians attempted to kill the Geth when it became obvious that the Geth had developed true intelligence. This started a civil war that the Quarians lost, resulting in their permanent exile from their home planet. The Geth then retreated into region of the galaxy known as "the Veil", and more than 300 years passed without anyone hearing from them, until they show up in ME1 as an opponent. Slowly, through all three games, you trace the history of the Geth. The Geth were the victims, not the aggressors, in the war with the Quarians. You learn that they were mainly peaceful, and that the hostile Geth you've encountered have been subverted by the Reapers. Ultimately, in ME3, you have the chance to end the hostilities between the Geth and Quarians, and re-unite them on Rannoch, the Quarian home world, after which the Geth help the Quarians resettle their home planet.

In ME2, we were introduced to an AI on the rebuilt Normandy, EDI, and over the course of ME2 and ME3, EDI learns how organics think, develops a moral code, and eventually acquires a humanoid body so she can work more closely with the organic beings who surround her. She tries to develop a sense of humor, and asks you how to become a better person. Eventually she develops a romantic attachment to the Normandy's pilot, Joker. She has no interest in killing organics, and, indeed, is as fully committed to fighting the Reaper threat as any other member of the Normandy's crew.

Yet, the reason we're given that the Reapers have imposed recurring genocides on the galaxy is that synthetic life will always destroy organic life. The cycles are the solution for a problem the Reapers say is insoluble. Really? Well, then, BioWare, you probably shouldn't have spent two whole games with EDI and the Geth demonstrating exactly the opposite. Our entire learned experience of the game is that organics and synthetics can, in fact, coexist quite peacefully, and—with the optimal gameplay route—quite cooperatively. We're given an ending in ME3 that refutes the entire narrative of the series in the last 20 minutes. Indeed, the only evidence we have in the entire series that synthetics will always destroy organics is that the Reapers, a synthetic race, ultimately destroy all intelligent organic species in one cycle or another. The irony of the Reapers' self-fulfilling prophecy aside, we are given no reason at all to believe that this organics vs. synthetics problem is true. We are just expected to take it on faith, despite the series' narrative teaching us the opposite lesson.

The final antagonist of ME3 is the Catalyst, the collective intelligence of the Reaper race. We are told by the the Catalyst that it resides on, and is an integral part of, the Citadel, a massive space station that is the central nexus for the system of mass relays that make galactic civilization possible. For this reason, the Citadel has, for thousands of cycles, become the natural seat of galactic government to the advanced races who discover it each cycle. The Catalyst is an entirely new and previously unknown character to whom we are introduced in the final scene of the game. The ending scene is generally not where major antagonists are introduced. Again, bad writing.

It is the Catalyst who fully explains the organics vs. synthetics "reasoning" behind the cycles, and the recurring genocide that constitutes the Reapers' solution. Prior to this, much of ME3's story revolved around building a device called the Crucible. Organic races have been working on the Crucible for, we are told, many cycles, passing its design plans from one cycle to the next, presumably via hidden data caches that the Reapers couldn't find. In this cycle, we found the Crucible plans that were hidden in that fashion on Mars by the main galactic race of the previous cycle, the Protheans. When the Crucible is finished, our attempt to use it against the Reapers leads us to our final scene with the Catalyst. The Catalyst tells us that creating and using the Crucible has now created an entirely new situation. "Our solution will no longer work," the Catalyst says.

Why the Crucible has made the Reapers' solution ineffective is unclear. In fact, the entire nature and purpose of the Crucible is completely nebulous. We literally have no idea what it does or how to activate it. Seriously. We spent the resources of every race in the Galaxy to create a weapon we know literally nothing about. Not even how to pull it's trigger. Or if it has a trigger. All we know is that we have to dock it with the Citadel. And when we finally dock it with the Citadel...nothing happens besides the Catalyst revealing itself. But for whatever reason, the Crucible has now changed the game, and the Catalyst tells us that his old solution is worthless.

Oh? Then fine, fly the Reapers into the sun, and let us come up with our own solution. If you know your solution no longer works, then why are you not immediately stopping it? Any more input from the Catalyst should be unnecessary. The Reapers' job is now over. All we need from them is to get lost, preferably permanently.

That doesn't happen of course. Instead, the Catalyst tells us that, thanks to mystery of the Crucible, it can now graciously give us three variably unpalatable choices to end the game, or, if you have the extended cut version, not end the cycles at all, meaning that the old solution will continue uninterrupted, despite the Catalyst just telling us that it won't work any more. The Catalyst may be an artificial intelligence, but it certainly isn't a real one.

In any event, our choices are:

Destroy the Reapers. This will also destroy EDI and all of the Geth, because reasons.

Control the Reapers, which requires us to grab some electrical terminals that will kill and consume us, but combine us with the Catalyst, and make us the God Emperor of Dune, and the omnipotent dictator of the galaxy, which shouldn't worry anyone at all.

Synthesize with the Reapers, which requires us to jump into an energy beam that will kill and consume us, but will also cause all organic and synthetic life to magically be combined into an organo-synthetic life form through a mechanism that is unexplained, and, frankly, defies explanation, considering our knowledge of, you know, science. But, this choice will bring about a universal utopia, where robots and trees have a perfect understanding of each other, and all forms of life become, effectively, cannibals, because even broccoli are part of our species now.

No matter what choice we pick from the above, the exact same scene plays out, as the game ends, with the major difference being the colors of the pretty explosions. "Choose the color of your destructor!" We are given no epilogue, no knowledge of what becomes of our compnanions, or any other story closure. We just get red, blue, or green explosions, all across the galaxy. Did galactic civilization survive? I dunno. Did Commander Shepard die? Maybe. Maybe not. The game is just over, and you can take any remaining questions and stuff them. The extended cut DLC partially fixes some of these problems, but only at the cost of making other story problems worse.

Frankly, at this point, I just don't have the strength to go any further. Suffice it to say that this is just a tiny part of the critique one could make about ME3's ending. You could probably write an entire book analyzing how bad the ending is. Or make a lengthy video critique. But, in the interests of time, I'll move on.

Oh, by the way, remember all the foreshadowing about dark energy in ME2? Yeah. We're never gonna hear about that again. Ever. This is a bit of bad writing that violates the principle of Checkhov's gun.

Dragon Age: Inquisition (2015)

DA:I was the third installment of the Dragon Age Series. The original, Dragon Age: Origins, was released in 2009, and has the same golden haze of reputation that KOTOR and ME1 share. 2011's Dragon Age II was less well-received by players. The problem with DA:I wasn't that the story was bad but that there just wasn't much of it. The story line constitutes a surprisingly small portion of the game. The vast majority of the game is endless fetch questing. There was, however, still a major story issue.

In Dragon Age II, the mystical mineral Red Lyrium was insanely powerful, and exposure to just a small piece of it drove one crazy. But it was, fortunately, extremely rare. In DA:I, the stuff is just everywhere. You walk through tunnels of it. Huge boulders of it sprout out of the ground. The bad guys are actively mining it. You spend a decent part of the game encountering it, destroying it, being surrounded by it, and it does...nothing. Small bits of it appear in DA2, and those small pieces drive the plot, but in DA:I it's everywhere, everyone's terrified of it, and it does...well...nothing much, except power some second-tier bosses. Indeed, if you follow one of the two possible story mission paths of DA:I, NPC characters have it literally growing out of their bodies, like tumors. You do "destroy" a few pieces of it for one companion mission by just bashing them with a hammer or shield. That seems less like destroying it than it does turning one big piece of Red Lyrium into a bunch of little pieces, each of which has the power to cause violent insanity in anyone who comes into contact with it. Ah, well, no matter. Also no matter: the mountains of the stuff you don't destroy that's just randomly littering the landscape. It's an extremely strange retcon for a material you're supposed to hate and fear.

The fundamental issue with DA:I is the lack of a major story. The traditional BioWare formula of working through a long story via conversations interspersed by action sequences was changed to hours upon hours of MMO-like grinding in the various open-world maps, and occasionally inturrupting the grind with some brief conversations. There are a lot of these maps, and each one is filled with endless fetch questing. Collect 19 shards. Close 5 rifts. Set up 6 camps, find 3 Venatori tomes...it never ends. The open-world gameplay was grindy and largely unnecessarily boring.

The actual story missions take up maybe 25 hours of gameplay. So, you might think, I'll just skip all the grindy bits and play the story. Not so fast. You see, you can't do a story mission unless you have enough Inquisition points to start it. You don't have enough influence, you see. You want to go to Orlais and stop a plot on the empress' life? That'll be 30 inquisition points, please. How do I get 30 Inquisition points? Complete grindy fetch quest missions.

And, of course, you have to be properly leveled up for each map to do the grindy fetch quests, and have good armor and weapons. How do you level up these characters, weapons, and armors? By completing fetch quest missions. Go gather 10 pieces of shimmering samite. Collect a white dragonling's scales. Get 6 pieces of blue viridion. And so on. And once you've collected all those bits, craft a new weapon. Also, you have 10 companions, so you'll need to craft weapons and armor for them, too. Get busy, Grindy!

DA:I was certainly no Witcher III.

This game didn't play to BioWare's supposed storytelling strength. Instead, it catered to the open-world, MMO aspects to hinder your ability to progress the story line. It's almost as if all the grindiness was specifically put into the game the hide the fact that the main story is actually quite short, in terms of the percentage it occupies in a game that's supposed to be built around player choice and relationships. Writing and storytelling in DA:I is more often noted by its absence, than by any of its qualities.

Mass Effect: Andromeda

ME:A was just a disaster. On release, the game was buggy, and much hilarity ensued with the creepiness of the facial animations, and the near impossibility of creating an attractive avatar in the character creator. The game was instantly meme-able, and not in a good way. But, forget the bugginess. The story itself was contrived, formulaic, and much of the writing was just plain bad.

ME:A contains some of the most laughable lines of dialog ever presented in an entertainment medium. "My face is tired from dealing with...everything." My face is tired? Who has ever said that as a metaphor for frustration? In one scene, you are talking to a romanceable character, and begin babbling like an idiot, ending with, "I'm just gonna go back to...the piloting thingy." There are many, many more examples of this, but bad dialog isn't the real problem, which is a fundamentally bad story.

The story is bad in innumerable ways, but I'll just present a smattering.

The premise of ME:A is that one year before the events of ME:3, a group of lusty, gusty adventurers create the Andromeda Initiative to set off for the Andromeda galaxy, 2 million light-years away. Never mind that this retcons the lore of Mass Effect, which is that journeys of more than 10 or so light years are impossible without mass relays. This limitation means that 99% of the Milky Way galaxy is unexplored, because there are no available mass relays to reach most of the galaxy. Apparently, even the Reapers can't reach those unexplored areas, and need to use mass relays as well. But in ME:A we can just naff off to a destination 2 million light-years away, no probs. Also, we can now travel those 2 million light-years in just 640 years, requiring an FTL speed of 3,125C. Jim Kirk could only do 512C on a good day. So, we've pretty much destroyed the lore that forms the whole basis for the Mass Effect universe. If we have the ability to go to Andromeda, that means we also have the ability to explore the 99% of our own galaxy that remains unexplored, and do it in far less time than going to Andromeda. If we already have a galaxy that is 99% unexplored, what, then, is the reason for the Andromeda Initiative?

From this faulty premise the story begins.

At the start of the game, you are a junior member of the Pathfinder team that is led by your father, who is the actual Pathfinder. On your first mission, you go to a planet that has too little oxygen, so you'll suffocate without an air supply. Unfortunately, you have an accident that cracks your face mask. Your father, an experienced soldier, takes off his helmet and gives it you you, as well as the computer codes that make you the Pathfinder. He does this even though he has an experienced soldier as his second in command, who should be the next Pathfinder.

It apparently never occurs to your father to use the buddy system on the helmet until the shuttle arrives, nor is it possible to fix your face mask, even though you did just that earlier in the mission. Nope, he just gives you the helmet and makes you the Pathfinder. Later, when you get back to the ship, everyone is like, "You're the Pathfinder now!" Your father's second, Cora, seemingly accepts it as well, even though she is the designated successor, and has the training needed to do the job. Oh, well.

Also, for some reason, though your father gave you the codes to become Pathfinder, you can't give them to Cora. So, I guess if you die, everyone's screwed, now.

They're screwed because of the next story problem that comes to mind, which is that you are supposed to be some savior figure. Before your arrival in Andromeda, the advance team, consisting of several thousand people, has already arrived and begun construction of a massive space station called the Nexus. They failed at setting up outposts due to hostile aliens, have no resources for unfreezing most of their people in cryo, and are on the ragged edge of survival. But you are the Pathfinder, so they do have an exploration ship they can let you have, along with a crew for it, and you can start settling outposts and the like. I mean, after all, they certainly aren't using it. They're waiting for you, Space Jesus, to redeem them all. "You're the magical pathfinder! No one can do anything until you arrive and fix it all!" So you set off to fix everything, except that you don't do any of the fixing. Remember those computer codes your dad gave you before he committed his completely unnecessary suicide? Those are codes that give you control over SAM, the AI your father created. SAM wants to kill his organic creators.

Oh, wait. No, he doesn't. SAM wants to help you colonize the Andromeda galaxy. Thus, at every step along the way, you do exactly what SAM, who is neurally linked to your mind, tells you to do. Sam says you need to fix some ancient alien structures. He tells you how to fix them. Every time you run into a problem that can't simply be shot, SAM solves it for you. SAM isn't the ghost in the machine, he is the whole machine and you are just his meat puppet. Seriously, SAM can even stop your fucking heart and kill you. And he will. Not, however, because he hates organics. Ultimately, SAM is the hero of the story. You are just his obedient avatar.

Thank you BioWare, for yet another AI narrative proving that the Catalyst's explanation in ME3 is stupid.

Oh, also, it turns out that before your ship arrived, there was a rebellion on the Nexus, after which the rebels left the station. The Krogan rebels created their own colony on one planet, and a bunch of rebel humans created a different colony on another. So why didn't the people left on the Nexus start creating colonies? That's a good question. I mean, they had an exploration ship, a crew, senior personnel available, and everything else they needed, but they just sat on their asses while their faces got tired, waiting for you. But it turns out they didn't need you. They just needed someone to run SAM's errands. Any reasonably fit, moderately dull character would've served. You just happened to be that character.

Oh, there's so, so much more to talk about, like more MMO-style grinding, and SJW virtue-signaling that was so over the top that BioWare had to apologize to the trans community, but suffice it to say that ME:A was such a disaster, and so poorly received, that all planned DLC releases were scrapped, and no support other than bug fixes and multiplayer improvements are available for the game.

ME:A got a Metacritic score of 72, the worst Metacritic score for any BioWare game.

Up to that time.

Anthem (2019)

BioWare clearly saw the Metacritic score for ME:A and said, "Hold my beer", because Anthem is currently sitting at 58.

Whatever else Anthem is, it isn't a traditional BioWare game, which is to say, it's not an RPG at all. To the extent that it has a story, the entire story mission path takes about 12-14 hours to play. The remainder is straight-up looter shooter. There are no NPC squadmates like BioWare's previous games. Instead, you can group with other human players—or go solo, though it's not recommended—to complete free-play world events, play through the story, and then endlessly grind the same story or fortress missions over and over and over, hoping for a loot drop that's marginally better than what you have equipped.

The story, such as it is, is not decision-driven in any way. To the extent there is dialog, you have two, and only two, dialog choices, and neither of them has any effect on the conversation, other than the tone of your responses. You can be kind and professional, or snarky and sarcastic. It doesn't mater which you choose, really, because it doesn't change the conversation or outcome at all.

It's hard to critique a story that hardly exists, except in the most linear sense, i.e., you have done a thing, and now it is time for you to do another thing. Now, when I say the story hardly exists, you may think I'm exaggerating for effect. So, let me respond this way. The story is so short that BioWare stuffed a series of fetch quests into it to artificially lengthen it. They admitted to doing this. Even BioWare knows the story is thin at best.

Anthem is a game with a big, open world that you can fly through, but how many players can be placed into the open world at any given time? Four. That's right. Four players on one massive map. The world, therefore, seems empty and dead, with little to do unless you're lucky enough to happen across one of the "world events" that aren't, by the way, publicized or visible on the game's map in any way. You also can't set waypoints on the map. If you kill an enemy and get a loot drop of some sort, you can't access your inventory in-game to see what it is. You literally have to end the mission to access your inventory. There are a couple standing missions that you can grind over and over for—hopefully—marginally better gear each time you grind it. Once you've finished the brief "story", there is literally nothing else to do in the game other than repetitive grinding. Which seems fun.

On release, the game had a number of game-breaking bugs, including one that presented you with an eternal loading screen. And speaking of loading screens, there are many of them, and they are long. Leaving your base, a place called Fort Tarsis, requires both a startup animation and a lengthy loading screen. Entering a fortress in the "open" world requires a loading screen. Going to a different area of the fortress requires a loading screen. Leaving the fortress requires a loading screen. If you don't get to a checkpoint close behind your teammates, you meet a barrier that won't allow you pass and participate in the rest of the mission. Leaving the mission requires a loading screen. Until recently, accessing your inventory—which you can do only in Fort Tarsis, of course—required a loading screen, but they got rid of that one via patch. I actually timed a mission while playing on Twitch, and I found that 1/3 of an entire mission's time was waiting for loading screens.

So, an extremely brief story, no endgame content, game-breaking bugs, and tons of loading screens. By the way, do want to know how long this game was in development? Seven years. BioWare started on it right after they released ME3 in 2012, but they didn't have a single playable mission, apparently, until some time in 2017. BioWare pawned off ME:A from the main team in Edmonton to the smaller, less-experienced team in Montreal, so that Edmonton could concentrate on Anthem. Montreal built all of ME:A before Edmonton, after five years of development, produced a single, playable mission, if the Kotaku article by Jason Schrier is to be believed.

So, Where Does That Leave Us?

BioWare was a great storytelling studio. Until about 2010, where we began to see a long, slow decline into what we have today. Based on the experience of the last several years, BioWare seems increasingly incapable of telling a good story, or, frankly, producing a good game. Looking at each successive BioWare game after Mass Effect, you can chart the decline in BioWare's quality and ability, bit by bit, until we got to Anthem. The Montreal studio was jettisoned after the ME:A embarrassment. The development of Anthem was apparently so chaotic and directionless that a lot of old BioWare employees left. All of those people who made KOTOR, ME1, and DA:O so great are, mainly, gone. The studio may have the same name, but it clearly isn't the same place it was in 2007.

A lot of people who love BioWare try to blame others for its issues. Now, if you want to blame BioWare's parent company, EA, for pushing games out the door of their child studios before they're fully baked, making them buggy, and requiring major patches to fix rendering and gameplay issues, then fine. You can blame EA for stuffing microtransactions of the worst sort into games. You can blame them for forcing Frostbite on all their studios, even though Frostbite was manifestly not capable of doing third-person RPG systems well, because it wasn't designed to do it, which caused a lot of extra development effort.

But let's not pretend that today's BioWare is the same studio that made KOTOR and ME1 more than a decade ago. Whatever BioWare might have been in 2007 in terms of creative story-telling, their talent has been diminishing, and that's been increasingly obvious with every succeeding game. For years, it has increasingly looked like BioWare is growing less capable of delivering the same kind of story experience it became famed for. I find that sad, because in the modern environment of gaming, where EA and Activision seem to care only about multiplayer, microtransactions, and games as a service, in order to monetize their games as much as is humanly possible, we need someone who cares about the player. We need someone who can write great single-player stories, immerse us in new worlds and experiences, and give us that sense of adventure that made ME1 so great.

I cared about Shepard and Garrus. I wanted to cure the genophage. I wanted Tali to have her beach house on Rannoch. I played and replayed the Mass Effect games, just to commune with characters I came to love as much as any character in a good book or TV show. They felt real in a way that most fictional characters don't. But, when I played ME:A, I remember getting about halfway through a playthrough when I thought to myself, "I don't care about any of these people. I don't like any of my squad mates. I don't care if the Andromeda Initiative is a success." I found that I just wasn't interested in flying around in the not-Normandy with not-Garrus and not-Wrex, and I didn't care if all the corpsicles stored on the not-Citadel ever got unfrozen. So, I just stopped playing.

That told me a lot.

UPDATE: This has been produced as a video essay here.
Since Elastic APM was introduced in June 2017, it has quickly grown into a full-fledged APM solution. With Elastic APM, we’re consistently progressing and building valuable new features for our customers.

The APM UI is designed to provide developers and operations with a highly curated and user-friendly dashboard to quickly analyze and debug the vast amounts of data coming from the APM agents.

When Elastic APM joined the fold, Kibana was in the middle of a massive redesign. A whole new UI design language, Elastic UI (EUI), was created and with it came a React framework for building interfaces in Kibana. Since most of this wasn’t readily available at the time, we had to make some considerations in how we wanted to build the application.

We started by fleshing out the basic components and variables of the UI, like colours, units for spacing and sizing, typography etc. We could continue to use the existing Kibana UI components where needed, but mixed in our own flavors for custom designs like the Transaction Timeline. Today, the basic components and variables have been removed by the introduction of EUI which is a testament to how far we’ve come in Elastic to provide such a comprehensive and strong framework.

A recipe for design

Examples of initial APM UI wireframes

When we set out to design new features, we typically research and dive deep on what will make this feature great. We regularly have discussions on how to create them within the existing application and how it builds on top of the work that is implemented in the agent or server components. Not all features require us to factor in the entire solution, but in order to build something that feels native to most customers using any language, we consider carefully how features apply in the application. We know that over time experiences for languages may convert into their own, but so far it has helped us shape the foundation of the UI.

Once we’ve settled on a design, we start with discussing how the feature looks in the UI. Which components and areas are affected and perhaps what new additions we have to build. Typically we’ll make simple wireframes and once we’re happy with the direction, turn those into more high fidelity mock-ups in Sketch and Marvel by utilizing the component libraries supplied in EUI. This makes building out larger pages quite easy, but sometimes we need to build custom components which requires a little more time and effort in the design phase. All throughout the process, decisions are shared and discussed with the team at large. This ensures that we design for both the common case, but also the edge scenarios that are bound to bubble up. We typically also want to reach the implementation phase as quickly as possible, because usually when we’re able to test it out with actual data, new challenges come up that need solutions. This is before any rigorous testing is performed, but just to check that the feature is solved in the appropriate way through all of our agents and scenarios.

It’s also not uncommon that we’ll choose to get a small but functional feature out so it can be used by the majority of our customers, and then iterate once we’ve heard some of the feedback. This helps us ship feature faster and not commit to larger complex releases every time that might not have been needed in the first place.

From that glimpse into our design process we thought it was in order to commemorate that we’ve been a part of the Elastic solutions for almost 2 years, this is a timeline of our releases in the last 16 months. We can’t wait to share what we still have in store for future releases!

The first version released included the main views that are included today. Users could analyze their transactions and errors information through the overview list and detail views. The first iteration of the Timeline that display the waterfall of events in each transaction was also included. Prior to the GA release, we had a beta release that allowed us to share the vision and get valuable feedback from the community.

The intention with this release was to add more integration with Kibana features, such as alerting (Watcher), enabling users to get error reports with the most occurring errors. We set out to build a very easy-to-use wizard to assist users in creating the watch from scratch and configure their notification settings.

Search is at the heart of everything we do at Elastic. It took a lot of effort behind the scenes to adapt the existing Kibana Kuery bar, but searching across your transactions and errors makes the process of performance analyzing a particular bottleneck much faster and easier when you can filter down the data to fit your needs. As icing on the cake, we also added the machine learning integration that enables customers to create anomaly detection on their services and have them show up in the APM UI charts.

When we introduced the concept of distributed tracing, we knew we had to rethink a lot of the UI to fit with the new use cases and user experience of analyzing across multiple services. The timeline specifically was redesigned to visualize not only spans, but also transactions, as we switched to display full traces which consists of transactions and spans from multiple services. There was a lot of work put into finalizing the timeline redesign with its new components and use cases.

The introduction of metrics in the APM UI was a larger solution-wide implementation. The feature really shines when used in conjunction with the search capability. Implementing a reasonably small design change because we already had the charting library and clear structure for where to place it. This is a first iteration of metrics and we continue to work on improving the view and the data we display.

7.x – Kibana redesign and what’s next

Kibana 7.0 introduced the global redesign that had been in the works since around our first introduction. Deep-linking to Logs and Infrastructure UI means users are able to quickly dive deep on a performance problem they’re investigating. Showing related errors on transactions in the timeline helps discover exceptions in traces.

Help us get even better

As we continue to improve the existing experience and introduce new features going forward, we’d love to hear about your experiences and get your feedback. Open a thread in our Discuss forum and tell us what you think.

If this is the sort of work you love to do, we’re always looking for talented designers to help build the solutions of tomorrow, so have a look at our open UX design positions.
Sharp Rise in the Share of Americans Saying Jews Face Discrimination

Discrimination seen as widespread against Muslims, other groups

The public sees widespread discrimination against several racial, ethnic and religious groups in the U.S. And while most of these views are little changed over the last several years, the share of Americans saying Jews face discrimination in the U.S. has increased substantially since late 2016.

Today, 64% of Americans say Jews face at least some discrimination – a 20-percentage-point increase from 2016; the share saying Jews face “a lot” of discrimination has nearly doubled, from 13% to 24%. Democrats remain more likely than Republicans to say there is discrimination against Jews, but the shift in these views is evident in both parties.

The survey by Pew Research Center, conducted March 20-25 among 1,503 adults, also finds majorities continue to say there is a lot or some discrimination against Muslims, blacks, Hispanics, gays and lesbians, and women. Muslims, in particular, are seen as facing more discrimination than other groups in society; 82% say Muslims face some discrimination, with 56% saying they encounter a lot of discrimination – highest among nine groups included in the survey.

While overall views about discrimination against most groups in U.S. society are little changed since 2016, already wide partisan divides in many of these views have grown wider. For example, in December 2016, 57% of Democrats and Democratic leaners, compared with 20% of Republicans and Republican leaners said that blacks faced a lot of discrimination – a 37-percentage-point gap. That has increased to 50 percentage points in the current survey: 69% of Democrats now say blacks face a lot of discrimination, compared with 19% of Republicans.

Majorities in both partisan groups say there is at least some discrimination against many groups, including Muslims, blacks, gays and lesbians, and Hispanics. But the share of Democrats who say each of these groups face discrimination is significantly higher than the share of Republicans who say the same. For instance, 92% of Democrats, compared with 69% of Republicans, say Muslims face at least some discrimination.

In contrast, Republicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to say that evangelical Christians (70% vs. 32%), whites (58% vs. 25%) and men (48% vs. 27%) are subject to at least some discrimination.

Growing partisan differences in views of discrimination

Partisan differences in views of how much discrimination several groups experience have widened in recent years.

Democrats have consistently been more likely than Republicans to say most groups face a lot of discrimination. Since 2016, however, the share of Democrats who say blacks face a lot of discrimination has increased, while Republicans’ views are little changed.

Since 2013, when a similarly-worded question asked about discrimination against African Americans, the change is even more striking. Six years ago, just 28% of Democrats said African Americans faced a lot of discrimination; today, more than twice as many Democrats say blacks face a lot of discrimination. (Over this period, an increasing share of Democrats also say that racial discrimination is the main reason some blacks cannot get ahead.)

Since 2016, there also have been sizable increases in the shares of Democrats who perceive a lot of discrimination against Hispanics (14 percentage points) and women (11 points).

Republicans’ views of discrimination are little changed in recent years, with a few exceptions. Somewhat fewer Republicans now see a lot of discrimination against gays and lesbians than did so six years ago (22% now, 30% then). As result, the partisan gap in these views has grown from 16 percentage points in 2013, when 46% of Democrats and 30% of Republicans perceived a lot of discrimination, to 35 points today (57% of Democrats, 22% of Republicans),

There also is a wider partisan divide in views of whether evangelical Christians face a lot of discrimination. Currently, just 8% of Democrats say this, little changed from December 2016. By comparison, 30% of Republicans hold this view, up from 21% in 2016.

The partisan gap in views about discrimination against whites is little changed from 2016; Republicans remain more likely than Democrats to say there is a lot of discrimination against whites (21% vs. 6%).

Among members of both parties, the shares saying there is a lot of discrimination against Jews has roughly doubled since 2016 – from 15% to 28% among Democrats and from 9% to 20% among Republicans.

Overall, whites are less likely than blacks to say that blacks face at least some discrimination (77% vs. 91%). Among whites, there is a wide partisan gap in views of discrimination against blacks (91% of white Democrats and Democratic leaners say there is at least some discrimination against blacks in our society, compared with 66% of white Republicans).

A similar pattern is seen for Hispanics. Whites overall are less likely to say that Hispanics face discrimination (73% of whites say this, compared with 86% of Hispanics). However, 90% of white Democrats say that Hispanics face at least some discrimination compared with 59% of white Republicans.

When asked about discrimination against whites, whites are more likely than blacks or Hispanics to say that there is at least some discrimination against whites in the U.S. (44% of whites say this compared to 29% of blacks and 33% of Hispanics). Yet while 60% of white Republicans say society discriminates against whites, only 24% of white Democrats share this view.

While majorities of both men and women say there is at least some discrimination against women, this view is more widely held among women (76%) than it is among men (62%). Both men and women are substantially less likely to see discrimination against men. Men are slightly more likely than women to say there is a lot or some discrimination against men (43% of men, 36% of women).

Within partisan groups there are no gender gaps in views about discrimination against men: About half of Republican men (51%) and a similar share of GOP women (44%) say that there is at least some discrimination against men. Both Democratic men (29%) and Democratic women (26%) are much less likely say this.

In views of discrimination against women, fairly comparable shares of Republican women (58%) and men (47%) say women face at least some discrimination. Democrats – both women (86%) and men (81%) – are far more likely than Republicans to see discrimination against women. However, a greater share of Democratic women (51%) than Democratic men (35%) say women face “a lot” of discrimination in our society.
She's been very candid about the many cosmetic procedures she has had done over the past few years.

And speaking about it once again, Lala Kent confessed on Monday that she sees Botox as a preventive measure for the future.

Speaking with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, the 28-year-old Vanderpump Rules star claimed as she got it done at a young age, she'll 'never have wrinkles'.

Scroll down for video

‹ Slide me › Before and after: Lala Kent revealed on Monday night's episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohan that she gets Botox so she'll 'never have wrinkles' - 2019 vs 2015

'I'm loving it,' said Lala when asked about what's happening with her Botox.

The host continued to ask why she needed to have the injectables even though she's only 28-years-old.

'Well, when I'm 50, people are gonna be glad I got it,' she said, adding: 'I mean, it's preventive!'

Knows what she's doing: 'Well, when I'm 50, people are gonna be glad I got it,' she said, adding: 'I mean, it's preventive!'

Lala further explained that as she likes to scrawl frequently, it prevents her from creating those lines, therefore in her eyes she'll 'never have wrinkles'.

And it's not the first time the beauty's opened up about her cosmetic procedures.

Speaking with Bravo last year, she said she's pretty much had her whole face altered, but felt as though she may have gone too far.

'I'm not the type of person that's going to walk out and say 'I've had nothing done'.'

'I will say this last time I may have overdid it. I want to stop with the lips, I want to stop with the fillers, enough is enough.'

Truth: 'I have Botox [points to forehead], I've had filler in my cheekbones, filler in the chin, filler in the jaw and my lips - so pretty much my whole face except my nose'

Lala, is that you? Lala looked very different back in 2015

'I have Botox [points to forehead], I've had filler in my cheekbones, filler in the chin, filler in the jaw and my lips - so pretty much my whole face except my nose,' she added.

Assuring fans it does only last for six months, she confessed there were still a few areas she'd still like to continuing enhancing.

'I think the only place I'd go back to is my jaw because my genetics are horrible with jawlines and Botox because I like to scrawl at people a lot.'

And it wasn't just Lala's Botox that was the talk of the day, with the beauty dishing on her marriage and kids plans while on SiriusXM's Jenny McCathy on Monday morning.

Doesn't like her jaw: 'I think the only place I'd go back to is my jaw because my genetics are horrible with jawlines and Botox because I like to scrawl at people a lot'

Life ambition: 'All I want in my whole life is to be a mama,' she said, adding: 'I'm meant to be a mom, for sure'

'All I want in my whole life is to be a mama,' she said, adding: 'I'm meant to be a mom, for sure.'

Lala got engaged to TV and movie producer Randall Emmett back in September 2018 and according to the reality star, are planning to start trying as soon as they tie-the-knot.

'We originally said two years after we get married, but Rand told me that we can start, like, right after we get married,' she added.

Randall is already a dad to daughters London, nine, and Rylee, five, who he shares with his ex-wife actress Ambyr Childers.
Andrew Yang, a businessman who is running for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president, said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that his proposal to provide every American with a $1,000 guaranteed monthly income would help "solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected in 2016." "To me the main...
The fire, in Jerusalem’s old town, broke out on the same tragic night one of Europe’s most famous Christian sites also burned in France.

Footage of the incident shows smoke filling the street as bright flame flicker and people cry out in surprise.

Parisians were also shaken last night as the inferno tore apart the iconic structure – with the spire collapsing into the abyss of the flames.

Fortunately, the Mosque fire did not cause major damage to the iconic structure, but it did endanger a part that is over 2,000 years old.

Initial reports suggested the incident was caused by an electrical fault but others claim playing children could be responsible.
“Marijuana can remain in the system and show up in a drug test for up to 45 days following use in regular users,” the California Chamber of Commerce wrote members this year. “There is no method to determine if an individual is impaired at the time the drug is found in that individual’s system or if it was consumed at an earlier time and the individual is no longer impaired.”
One of the key attractions of Disney’s new Star Wars lands will be the opportunity for fans to build their own unique lightsabers. Now, thanks to a special VIP-only presentation from the team at Disney Parks, we finally know how the build process will work. We’ve also held the final product in our hands. I’m happy to report that these are stunning reproductions, and a lot heavier than they look.

Product experts from the Disney Parks team were on hand at this year’s Star Wars Celebration in Chicago for a handful of presentations that included examples of the final product. Here’s how the process will work.

Two different lightsaber shops will be available at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge when it opens at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The first, called Dok-Ondar’s Den of Antiquities, will sell a series of 10 legacy lightsabers based on famous blades from the Star Wars canon. The second, called Savi’s Workshop, will allow fans to build their own lightsaber from a discrete collection of parts.

Both the legacy and the custom lightsabers will be compatible with a universal blade system. Blades are available in different lengths and sizes, and each one will light up in a variety of colors depending on the hilt that it is attached to.

The legacy blades on display at Celebration included replicas of both of Luke Skywalker’s lightsabers, as well as the iconic weapons carried by Ahsoka Tano, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, and Mace Windu. Each will come packed in its own satin-lined presentation case, complete with a unique chevron on the outside.

Some blades will also come with additional accessories to make them more accurate. Kylo Ren’s blade will come with two additional blades to accommodate its iconic crossguard, while Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi will feature a special attachment point for its extremely narrow emitter.

The custom blades are a different animal entirely. Building one will be part of an intimate, small-group experience inside the park.

Before entering the “build chamber” at Savi’s Workshop, guests must first choose from one of four types of lightsaber kits. Options include the Jedi-focused Peace and Justice set, the Sith-focused Power and Control assortment, the more naturalistic Elemental Nature set, and the mysterious Protection and Defense kit. Once inside the build chamber, cast members called Gatherers will arrive and offer a choice of three differently colored kyber crystals.

Holocrons, available for an additional charge, will allow guests to access additional Star Wars story content tied to the kyber crystal itself. Photo: Charlie Hall/Polygon

The crystals themselves are random. Guests will know the color, but not the cut or kind of crystal until they open it. Once selected, crystals will then be inserted into a holocron, which will allow iconic characters from the Star Wars universe to whisper the mysteries of the Force. Disney staff stressed that the crystals themselves contain new and unusual lore about the Star Wars universe.

From there, Gatherers will assist guests in using the discrete set of parts that they have selected to customize their blade.

I hung out for a while at the Disney Parks booth before the demonstration went live, and was shocked when the presenter dropped one of the individual components on the table. The tiny, two-inch square module clanged off the table like a piece of good brass plumbing hardware. Later, when I had the opportunity to hold a custom lightsaber in my hand, I was astounded at the weight of the object. It’s easily much heavier than an old school, 12-inch Maglite flash lite.

Unlike those old school Maglites, however, these lightsabers run on AA or AAA batteries. The weight comes entirely from the high-quality materials that they are constructed from.

A host of accessories will also be on sale, including full-length padded carrying cases for those who purchase the optional blades. Robust, universal belt clips are also available. They offer both direct attachment points and clips for the D-rings common on some lightsabers. Additionally, fans can also purchase their own holocron so that they can “commune with the Force” and learn about their own, unique kyber crystal at home.

No pricing information was available.

Both the legacy lightsabers and custom lightsabers will be available for fans when Galaxy’s Edge opens in California on May 31. Nearly identical shops will also open at Disney World in Orlando, Florida on Aug. 29.
RBR CZ Analysis

Here you can check on some Richard Burns Rally Czech analysis.

Since it's beginnings in 2005, over 120 000 tournaments have been hosted, with over 34 000 000 stage results made by over 27 000 drivers.

This project was made out frustation: RBR CZ does not provide records grouped by physics. This gave an incentive to practice web scraping, parsing and data analysis to extract rather interesting info and share it with the community.

Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks about Trump administration policies towards Muslim immigrants outside the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)

When the ‘victim’ is the victimizer

‘It has to stop,” says Representative Ilhan Omar.

No, it does not.

Representative Omar, the Jew-hating Minnesota Democrat, is engaged in one of her usual games of misdirection, a pattern of hers that by now is familiar enough to be predicted: She says something outrageously stupid, offensive, anti-Semitic — or all three at once — and then attempts to parry the thrust of inevitable criticism by characterizing it as an attack on Muslims, women, women of color, Muslim women of color, etc.

Advertisement

Advertisement

In this case, Representative Omar characterized the events of September 11, 2001, this way: “Some people did something.” Someone assembled a video intercutting her blasé account of mass murder with images of that day’s events, and Donald Trump, who serves simultaneously as president of the United States and the nation’s social-media intern, tweeted the video, along with some vintage all-caps emoting: “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”

The New York Times stepped on Representative Omar’s cue and uttered her lines itself, insisting that the criticism of Representative Omar is necessarily part of an attack on Muslims categorically. Trump of course has on more than one occasion treated Muslims categorically, for instance in calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which, like so many of President Trump’s blustery promises, never came to pass and never even was given serious consideration. (The actual policy consists of restrictions on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, along with North Koreans and officials of the Venezuelan government.) Representative Omar is not all Muslims, and she is not Muslims categorically: She’s a loopy left-wing identity-politics entrepreneur whom the Democratic party has carried to the U.S. House of Representatives. Criticism of elected officials is not only permissible but necessary.

But Representative Omar believes she is above such criticism: “It has to stop,” she said, citing death threats she has received since the presidential tweet. That argument is pure horsepucky. It is an unfortunate fact of life in Anno Domini 2019 that practically everyone in public life receives death threats, often on social media or in online forums. Elected officials do. Journalists and commentators do. Entertainment figures do. I do, and my colleagues do. That’s our dumb world. And, currently, it’s part of the price for certain kinds of careers. There isn’t anything special about Representative Omar in this regard. She’d get death threats if she were a Fox News host, too.

Advertisement

But such threats are a useful pretext for politicians who want to shut down criticism for their own narrow political ends. Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist rape-fantasy entrepreneur from Brooklyn who represents Vermont in the Senate, insisted that criticism (he wrote “attacks”) simply “must end.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the fake Indian from Oklahoma who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, accused the president of attempting to “incite violence.”

The Democrats are in a political pickle. They would very much prefer that the Jew-hating caucus shut up, and they are not crazy about the fact that the public face of the Democratic party is, at the moment, risible and demented amateurs such as Representative Omar and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, i.e., the people who are even crazier than Senator Sanders. But intersectionality is a jealous god, and they cannot simply tell Representative Omar et al. to sit down and clam up. All they can really do is to try to raise the price of criticizing the nut cutlets on the Democrats’ menu by insisting that criticism of Representative Omar is an attack on Muslims as such, that criticism of Representative Ocasio-Cortez is an attack on Latinas who don’t know how a bill becomes a law, that criticism of Robert Francis O’Rourke is an attack on . . . whatever it is that “Beto” is pretending to be this week. The New York Times et al. are reliable allies on that front.

Advertisement

Advertisement

This is, incidentally, what all those fake hate crimes are really about: Redefining criticism of Democratic politicians and constituencies as violence. When there isn’t enough violence to make that case in a sufficiently dramatic fashion, then violence can simply be invented — and, if the case of Jussie Smollett is anything to go by, the cost of doing so is pretty low. When’s the last time you heard of a prosecutor dropping a 16-felony indictment in exchange for a firm handshake?

Advertisement

That’s a neat trick, really: to be the hostage and the hostage-taker at the same time.

Advertisement

Representative Omar may not be the most intelligent person in Congress, but she is not so dumb that she does not know what she is doing when she dismisses 9/11 as an event in which “some people did something,” because below-average oysters and cuttlefish aren’t that dumb. She is following a pretty obvious career path and hopes to be to American Muslims what the Reverend Jesse Jackson has been to African Americans and what Hillary Rodham Clinton has been to embittered left-wing women who faint a lot: a sacred person, beyond the reach of the profane.

And, apparently, beyond criticism, too.

Robert Wiblin: Hi listeners, this is the 80,000 Hours Podcast, where each week we have an unusually in-depth conversation about one of the world’s most pressing problems and how you can use your career to solve it. I’m Rob Wiblin, Director of Research at 80,000 Hours.

Before we get to Persis, just a quick reminder that the Effective Altruism Global conference is coming up in San Francisco in late June. There’s also a smaller spin-off conference focused on effective altruism in Sydney this coming September. You can find out more about both and potentially apply to attend at eaglobal.org.

Also, it’s been a while since I’ve mentioned that you should definitely spend a minute thinking about whether you’re listening to this show at the right speed. If you find your attention drifting you might like to speed it up a bit, while if you find it hard to follow, maybe slow it down to 90 or 80% its actual speed.

If you’re listening to podcasts in a way where you can’t change their speed, you’re making a huge mistake. Almost all podcasting apps now allow you to pick the ideal speed for each show you listen to. I’ve gone through and set individual optimal speeds for all of the 30 shows I subscribe to, and over the years it has probably saved me weeks of my life.

But if that sounds intimidating you can start by just adjusting the speed on this show to balance speed, attention and comprehension.

Also, just to let you know, there’s a quick discussion between me and two of my colleagues, Neil Bowman and Michelle Hutchinson at the end of the show, including some ideas they have for tackling wild animal welfare that didn’t come up in the interview with Persis.

Alright, here’s Persis.

Robert Wiblin: Today I’m speaking with Persis Eskander. Persis is a researcher at the Open Philanthropy Project in their farm animal welfare program. And prior to joining the Open Philanthropy Project, Persis co founded and managed a small nonprofit focused on improving wild animal welfare. That project recently merged with Utility Farm to create the Wild Animal Initiative, whose goal is to understand and improve the lives of animals in the wild, though Persis is not involved in that project.

Robert Wiblin: Before that she spent several years as an analyst at the Australian Department of Defence, and she has a BA in philosophy, and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of New South Wales in Australia. Thanks for coming on the podcast, Persis.

Persis Eskander: Thanks, it’s really great to be here.

Robert Wiblin: All right, yeah. So I hope to get you to talk about wild animal welfare as a problem and, I guess, what might be done about it in the future. But first, what are you actually doing now at the Open Philanthropy Project, and why do you think it’s valuable work?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so as you said I’m now working as a researcher for the farm animal welfare program team. So the farm animal welfare team at Open Phil gives about $30 million a year to effective farm animal advocacy organizations. And I do research that helps support Lewis and Amanda make grant making decisions, and figure out where they want to give.

Robert Wiblin: What are the biggest differences with what you were doing before at Wild Animal Suffering Research?

Persis Eskander: So one of the biggest differences is that I’m not managing a project anymore, which is actually a huge relief to me. I’ve realized that I much more prefer being a member of a team than actually leading a project. And then, obviously, there’s a shift in cause area, so now I do my day to day work with farmed animals as opposed to working on wild animals.

Robert Wiblin: Cool. So I’m hoping to get Lewis, Lewis Bollard, back on the program at some point in the next six months, so we might skip on that one and move on to talking about the meat of the conversation today, which is wild animal welfare. How would you sum up the challenge of wild animal welfare?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so most people, and I was one of these people at one point in time, have this romanticized view of what life is like in nature. We tend to have the sense that it’s really idyllic. But in reality, wild animals have a whole range of really negative experiences. So they could be hunted, attacked, or predated on. There’s often intense resource competition, and so starvation or chronic hunger is very common for a lot of animals. And things like disease, parasitism, and injury don’t receive any treatment. And so basically the reality for life in the wild is that it’s full of a lot of really intense experiences that we don’t fully understand because we’ve eliminated them for ourselves.

Persis Eskander: One thing that’s worth keeping in mind as well is that nature isn’t good or bad. It doesn’t say anything about happiness or suffering. What we can do to get a better sense of what experiences wild animals have is look at what drives our existence, and then figure out from those what experiences are animals most likely to have as a result. So for example, if we look at evolutionary selection, what we end up seeing is that what drives our existence is something like survival of the fittest. And so that basically means that the strongest end up surviving, and those who don’t end up meeting that high bar, there’s no help for them. There’s no treatment. There’s no solution. They just have these negative experiences and then they die.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, so briefly, just at the start, let’s run through the importance, neglected, and tractability points in our problem selection framework one by one. What is the scale or importance of wild animal welfare, I suppose, which cashes out to how many wild animals are there, and how much suffering and how much misfortune do they suffer?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so we don’t really have a very good sense of how many animals there actually are. What we do have are some estimates. I think the most recent estimates, or the only estimates that I’ve seen, have been done by Georgia Ray and Brian Tomasik, and they estimate something like one quadrillion wild vertebrates, and one sextillion wild invertebrates, which is just orders of magnitude greater that the number of farmed animals and humans. Even if we combine the two, it’s still orders of magnitude greater.

Robert Wiblin: Hey, listeners. I just wanted to jump in and define vertebrate and invertebrate because I know a lot of people, it turns out, don’t know what those things are. So vertebrates are animals that have a backbone or a spine, which includes all of the mammals, marsupials, obviously, fish, birds, reptiles, that kind of thing. So most of the big land animals that we’re familiar with. Also whales, of course.

Robert Wiblin: Then invertebrates are actually far more numerous in terms of the number of species that they have and they’re a whole separate kind of evolutionary tree of species that never developed this kind of backbone structure. So that includes insects, arachnids, mollusks, crustaceans, corals, crabs, and velvet worms and jelly fish and all of those kind of things that don’t have spines. All right, I’ll leave that there and go back to the show.

Persis Eskander: And again we don’t really have a very good sense of how severe the negative experiences that they have are, or how subjectively bad it is for them to actually have these negative experiences.

Persis Eskander: But what we can do is think about the total number of wild animals. And if we, for example, aggregate the amount of negative experiences across all of these wild animals, then what we end up with is a problem on a scale so much larger than any other problem in the near term.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I mean, I guess even if their lives were as good as humans are, then there’s still a lot of badness going on in there that could potentially be alleviated.

Robert Wiblin: Okay, so moving on from scale, neglectedness … How many people are working on this problem, both indirectly and directly? What’s the budgets of all the organizations that think about it?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so it’s pretty clearly a neglected problem. If I were to guess, I would say there was something like less than 20 people who are actually working on this problem, meaning people who are focused on wild animal welfare. But even most of those aren’t working full time. If we’re talking resources, then I’d guess that there’s something like less than a million dollars a year combined across all of these organizations.

Robert Wiblin: Okay, yeah. And the tractability, perhaps the hardest one to measure, or hardest one to know at this early stage.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so it’s really uncertain what sort of solutions we have to the problem. I mean, it’s a large, complex problem. And I think that it’s not clearly the case that wild animal welfare is tractable, but it’s also not clearly the case that it’s not. And so I think we’re kind of at this early exploratory stage, where we’re trying to better understand the problem and figure out if it’s even possible for us to do something about it. And if it is, the sort of things we’d want to do would be net positive in the long run. They’d be cost effective, and they’d be the sorts of interventions that could be really easily accepted and adopted.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, we’ll have to come back to the tractability issue later on.

Robert Wiblin: So you mentioned these very large numbers of animals. Do we have any sense of … are these very big animals or very small animals? I guess it’s mostly small animals. And so maybe rather than talking about the number of them, it might be more sensible to talk about their weight or the number of brain cells or something that they have, to make it a more fair comparison with farm animals and humans?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so if you break down the scale of wild animals in terms of abundance, then what you do end up seeing is that the main drivers of the figures tend to be much smaller animals. And those are fish; arthropods, like insects and spiders; or aquatic arthropods like crustaceans; and worms. If we try and break it down differently, so if we look at biomass … There was a really interesting paper that was released in 2017 that is called The Biomass Distribution on Earth, and they basically do something similar. They try and break out the biomass of different animal and plant life. And what we end up finding is that invertebrates still dominate the equation, but they dominate by a much smaller ratio. So we end up with 0.7 gigatons of carbon for wild vertebrates, and 1.7 gigatons of carbon for invertebrates. So it’s only one order of magnitude greater. If we look at it by neuron count, then we get still the same breakdown, but again the ratio is much smaller.

Persis Eskander: So Georgia Ray did a really, really interesting small project running the numbers for the total number of neurons of wild animals, and again broke it down into different categories. I think her post is called How Many Neurons Are There? And she estimates something like, again these are massive numbers, but it’s like 44 sextillion neurons for wild vertebrates, and 217 sextillion neurons for invertebrates. So again we get a much smaller ratio when we try and look at different measures for the scale of wild animals.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, do you have any sense of how those numbers compare to the weights and neural masses for all farm animals and, say, all humans put together?

Persis Eskander: They are smaller still. But again I think we see a pretty similar trend when we compare the numbers of wild animals to humans and farm animals. The ratio is much larger than biomass, which is also much larger than neurons. And that is what you would expect because even though the total number of humans is lower than the total number of wild animals, because the total number of wild animals is largely dominated by very small, not very complex animals, the neuron count ends up showing a smaller ratio between the two.

Persis Eskander: I gave a talk at EA Global last year that has a more detailed breakdown of these figures, so that might be a great place to get more information.

Robert Wiblin: Hey listeners. At that point, I found that talking about tables of numbers doesn’t tend to make for great conversation on the show so we’re going to punt it on digging down into the exact numbers of all of the different categories of animals. But, fortunately, I’ve gone and dug up some tables of that so I could walk you through it now. If you’re not interested in this you can skip forward a couple of minutes, but I think there’s really some quite remarkable things here.

Robert Wiblin: So these numbers have been collated by Brian Tomasik who has an interest in animal and wild animal welfare and I will put a link up to the articles that we’ve drawn these numbers from. Brian would be the first person to say that a lot of these numbers are very tentative because we just don’t have a great way of counting the numbers or weighing the mass of, lots of these different categories of animals. But nonetheless, we can make some very broad guesses or maybe some guesstimates of these kind of numbers. And even if they’re right in broad strokes, they can be potentially much, much better than having no idea at all.

Robert Wiblin: So I’m going to, I think, give all the ratios just in terms of the number … Give the comparison of that group compared to humans. So we’ve got eight billion humans and the mass of them is about eight billion times by 60 kgs each, on average, so you can get a sense of how large they are.

Robert Wiblin: So lab animals, there is about 1% as many lab animals as there are humans. So we’ve got eight billion humans and about 100 million lab animals. That’s only including vertebrates.

Robert Wiblin: Then for livestock, which includes land vertebrates, we’ve got about three times as many of them as we have of humans. For birds, there’s about 25 times as many birds as there are humans. For mammals as a whole, there’s 38 times as many as there are of humans. Reptiles, 125. Amphibians, 125 again. Then for fish, we’ve jumped up to 12,500 times as many fish as there are humans. Earthworms, 125,000 times as many as there are humans.

Robert Wiblin: Then we get down to smaller, potentially less significant creatures. So dust mites, 125,000 again. Coral polyps, 1.25 million. And then going all the way down to nematodes, these tiny, tiny creatures 12,500,000,000 is the estimate in terms of the raw number.

Robert Wiblin: I think, broadly, one thing we can just take away from that is that there are vastly more wild animals in many of these different categories than there are humans. Or indeed all animals that humans are farming really by a very long way. But then you might think, well, obviously almost all of those species are much smaller than humans. So you’d reasonable to think, wow we should actually think about this in terms of relative weight. So let’s go through those estimates to take a guess at what the weight is of these different classes of animals compared to humans.

Robert Wiblin: So at the lower end, we’ve got elephants alone, .25% of the total weight of all humans. Then adding up all of the wild vertebrates it’s only 10% as much as humans, which is kind of surprising to me.

Robert Wiblin: But in the ocean you’ve got a whole lot more. Whales alone are 30% of the weight of all humans. And then if you got all of the fish together, they weigh about the same as the entire human population.

Robert Wiblin: But then if you move beyond vertebrates, which it turns out pretty insignificant in the scheme of life on earth, both in terms of numbers and weight, invertebrates in the ocean weigh, collectively, about 10 times as much as all human do, while invertebrates on the land are about 20 times the weight of all humans.

Robert Wiblin: Then if you add up all of the funguses out there, which I guess a lot of them are under the soil, it’s about 100 times the weight of all people. And if you look at prokaryotes, which are these single celled organisms, or very basic organisms, now we’ve got some really staggering numbers. So prokaryotes, these very tiny, microscopic organisms in the water weigh about 175 times the weight of all humans according to this estimate. Prokaryotes in the soil are about 500 times the weight of humans. Other prokaryotes just underneath the soil on land, 2,500 times. And then prokaryotes underneath the soil in the sea, 3,750 times the weight of all humans.

Robert Wiblin: I did not predict those numbers and I’m not quite sure to make of the fact that there’s tons of these tiny, single-celled organisms out there. Really just a vast weight of them. But I thought that was pretty interesting and surprising.

Robert Wiblin: Perhaps the thing that’s more important to take away from this is just that the weight of all invertebrates is vastly larger than the weight of all vertebrate animals like birds and reptiles and mammals, including humans.

Robert Wiblin: Okay, now another thing that I would really love to know here is the weight of all of the brains of the creatures in these different categories, which might give us some sort of proxy for their moral weighting. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to find a good summary table of that to even give me rough guidance. One thing that is interesting to note is that invertebrates, like insects, have a larger fraction of their mass as neurons and they also tend to have denser brains. So they have more complexity in each gram of brain in ants as there is in humans, interestingly, perhaps because they’re so small they have to evolve more rigorously to cram as much computation as they can into these very tiny brains.

Robert Wiblin: So not only have we got the fact that invertebrates already weigh, collectively, something like 30 times the weight of all humans, but the weight of the brains in all these invertebrates is going to be more than 30 times the weight of the brains in all humans. But, unfortunately, I haven’t got figures for all of the other categories. Hopefully, we’ll be able to return to that some other time on the show.

Robert Wiblin: I have, however, managed to get the total size of all of the brains of various different farm animals compared to humans. And those animals include chickens, sheep, pigs, and cows. And again, to my surprise, it turns out that if you take the brains of all … Humans, chickens, sheep, pigs, and cows, about 90% of the weight of the brains is actually in the humans. So you’ve got chickens making up only 1% of the brain mass of all of those creatures and cows about 6%. So the fact that humans just have larger brains, as a fraction of their body, is doing a lot of work there.

Robert Wiblin: Then, finally, just for a handful of species, that is humans, cows, and chickens, Carl Schuman, has managed to look at the number of neurons that are in each brain. So taking a count of the neural density, not just going with weight, but counting the actual number of … potentially correlate of the processing capacity of these brains. And that actually doesn’t shift things all that much. You end up with about 98% of the neurons in all humans, cows, and chickens in the world being in humans. And then about 1% in cows and 1% in chickens. And I’ll link to the blog post where you’ve got the calculations for that. It’s all pretty rough and ready, but obviously, when you’re talking about something being 100 times bigger than something else and the measurements here being fairly reasonable, it’s not going to be dramatically different from that, I don’t expect. Unless there’s a major hidden error in here somewhere.

Robert Wiblin: All right, I’ll link to the sources for all those numbers so you can pore over them a little bit more carefully than listening to me go through them. And we’ll get back to Persis.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, okay. So there’s an awful lot of wild animals. What do we know, if anything, about their welfare? What are their lives like?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so unfortunately we actually don’t know a huge amount about the welfare of wild animals. There is some research, mostly in animal welfare science, and that tends to focus a lot more on domestic species or working animals or farmed animals. But they do have some interesting tools or models that we can use to better understand the welfare of wild animals. So, for example, one is the Five Domains model, which looks at four physical states … I think they’re health, environment, nutrition, and behavior … and one mental state, which is just how they respond when they feel distress, anger, happiness, or when they’re content. So those are really interesting because we can use those to try and understand the signals that animals send when they feel various negative or positive experiences.

Persis Eskander: Another tool that also comes from animal welfare science is trying to test for an animal’s revealed preferences. And so, for example, if you measure the amount of effort that a rabbit goes to to access food, that might be proportional to how bad it might be for them to experience hunger. So we kind of are hoping to build more of these tools, or get a wider range of these models that we can use to figure out how we can better assess the experiences that wild animals have, and how bad they are for those animals. But right now there’s just very little research specifically for wild animals. And whatever we do have is on such a small scale that it’s really very hard to rely on it, and to make accurate judgements from it. And so one thing I’d love to see is more research focused on that.

Robert Wiblin: What are the key activities or experiences that you think generate a lot of suffering or pleasure for wild animals that people might not fully appreciate?

Persis Eskander: Animals basically make trade offs in terms of how they spend their energy. So they will spend large amounts of time looking for food. But once they’ve found access to food and water, they spend a lot of time resting. It’s usually not the case that they’re extremely active or engage in a lot of play because that costs resources and those tend to be reserved. It’s probably likelier that animals spend quite a lot of time finding appropriate shelter or preserving their shelter so that it’s not taken from them.

Persis Eskander: And then there are things like parasitism and disease or injury, which … I don’t really have a good sense how frequent they are in the wild, but to the extent that they do exist, they tend to spread through populations and they become quite chronic. So it’s likely that when there is parasitism prevalent in a very social group of animals, that that’s something that they’re all experiencing, or a large population of them are experiencing.

Robert Wiblin: Is there a danger that we might think that wild animals’ lives are worse than they actually are, if we kind of just imagine how we as humans would feel if we were put into their situation? And obviously we’re not adapted to cope with the situations and would maybe find them more unpleasant than wild animals actually do.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I think it is a concern that if we try and extrapolate the experiences of wild animals and apply them to ourselves that we end up basically anthropomorphizing their experiences. I think it’s a pretty useful tool to help people establish the basis of empathy for the sorts of experiences wild animals could be having. And so it’s maybe better as a communication strategy than as the basis on which we design our research or design any possible interventions.

Persis Eskander: When we’re talking about what we actually want when we’re trying to figure out how we can help wild animals, then I think we need to be a lot more robust and ask questions like how adverse are these experiences, actually, for wild animals based on the signals they tell us? Or, for example, what are their revealed preferences? And we can use those to try and develop policies that are maybe steeped in more accurate judgements of what they’re actually experiencing.

Robert Wiblin: Do you think that wild animals would be better off if we eliminated all parasites, like all of the diseases or parasites that they’re suffering from, or if we kind of got rid of all of the predators, hypothetically, that were hunting them? Do we have any sense of how much badness comes from these different categories?

Persis Eskander: So that’s kind of a tough question to answer. I think, in a hypothetical world where there are no philosophical objections to something like that and we manage to confidently resolve any concerns we would have about how to actually implement a policy like that, I’d expect that the main concern would be that we just don’t understand the flow-through effects for the ecosystem. I mean, we don’t understand the flow-through effects of the entire elimination of something like predation or parasitism, and we don’t even understand what that’s like for partial or restricted elimination. And so I think it’s because of these uncertainties that we wouldn’t actually ever recommend a policy like that.

Persis Eskander: One thing we could do is look at historical cases of trophic cascades to try and get a better sense of what the effects of something like this might be. So for example, there has been the removal of predators in many populations, in many areas, particularly as a result of urbanization or industrial agriculture. And then there’s also been rewilding experiments, like reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone National Park.

Persis Eskander: I mean, hypothetically, in a scenario where we create this kind of trophic cascade, say removing predators, we might expect to see something like the prey population balloons, and as a result of growing so much the ratio of food to the prey population is reduced. So what we end up seeing is something like increased resource competition. And that might mean that animals are no longer being predated, but now there is an increased amount of aggression within species or across species, and that maybe animals are now dying as a result of starvation as opposed to being predated on.

Persis Eskander: Another effect we might expect is that once populations grow, they become much denser, and that allows parasites to flourish. And what we might end up seeing with really dense populations that weren’t, once, that dense, is that also parasitism crosses species. And a lot of animals that haven’t become accustomed, or haven’t built appropriate immune mechanisms end up suffering a significant amount more as a result of that.

Persis Eskander: So it’s not actually very clear that it would be net positive to eliminate something that we think is a harm, because we don’t really understand the full effects as a result of that.

Robert Wiblin: One reason I was asking that is because it’s easy to see how, if you got rid of predators, then this potentially creates a population explosion, like people raise the specter all the time. And then it’s like, well rather than being predated upon, instead they’re just starving, or like on the margin some animals are starving because something has to limit the population’s growth.

Robert Wiblin: But it seems like, potentially, parasites keep their hosts alive a lot of time, but might make their lives really miserable. So it might be that the amount of suffering that you get rid of relative to the amount of the population increase that you get might be a lot more limited. It just, perhaps, doesn’t cascade into other animals, or doesn’t create broader changes. It just kind of gets rid of this gut worm or whatever thing that’s gnashing away at their flesh, but for some substantial fraction of their life.

Robert Wiblin: You’re looking skeptical. You’re like, “Rob, you’re naïve. Who knows what effects these things would have.”

Persis Eskander: It’s a nice theoretical argument, and I would be really interested in people studying this more. I’d be really interested in actually a constrained environmental study of what happens if you remove a particular parasite from a population, and then seeing what the effects of that might be.

Persis Eskander: I think one reason I am skeptical is that there are lots of trophic effects that we just don’t understand. And even now through the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone, there are things that ecologists are discovering as a result of that that they didn’t actually expect would be an effect of reintroducing them. So it’s more that … I’d be pretty surprised if the way to increase wild animal welfare was to engage in this large scale elimination practice. I think it’s more likely to be the case that we actually implement a lot of really small, different policies that address incremental parts of the problem, and then amount to a large ratio of the problem, because those are less likely to be risky for ecosystem health.

Robert Wiblin: Cool. So we’ll, I guess, return to this question of how likely this stuff is to backfire later. I’m perhaps a little bit more gung ho than you are. But I suppose you’ve been in the actual area, so you have more knowledge about how things can go wrong. It’s very easy to be naïve about it, from my distant perspective.

Robert Wiblin: I know people who are worried about wild animal welfare tend to focus particularly on certain kinds of species. I guess insects tend to loom pretty large. Do you want to explain for people why that is?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, so I would say that the argument largely comes from looking at life history strategies. So the general idea is that animals that live really short lives, we might expect will also have negative lives. So life history theory suggests that animals have to make trade offs with their energy budgets. And for a lot of species, the reproduction trade off they make is quantity versus complexity.

Persis Eskander: So for example, frogs will lay something like 6,000 to 20,000 eggs in one season. And then once they’ve spawned, the female frog really leaves them largely unprotected to just develop, hatch, and then, as tadpoles, to continue their development largely on their own. And so because they’re unprotected, large numbers of them will end up dying at very early stages. But for the female it’s a more efficient strategy because she invests less resources in gestation and in care, and that allows her to have more reproductive sessions throughout her life.

Persis Eskander: So what we end up seeing is that there are a very small number of animals in each season that will survive. But the large majority of them are just not equipped, or don’t have enough access to resources, or basically are just predated. And so they live for a very short period of time, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, and then they die.

Persis Eskander: And so if we think of the quality of an animal’s life in terms of the number of positive experiences they have versus the number of negative experiences they have, it’s pretty unlikely, if they’ve lived for a really short period of time, that they’ve amassed enough positive experiences to outweigh what we expect to be the very negative experience of death. And so because the most numerous animals follow this life history strategy, and the most numerous animals are all short lived, we might expect that when we look at the, I guess, net sign of the lives of wild animals as a whole, the lives of short lived animals dominate.

Robert Wiblin: Okay, so if I’m like a human or a whale, then I’m like, “Every offspring is precious and I hope to get a large fraction of them to adulthood,” but if I’m like an insect, then I’m like, “I’m going to lay a thousand babies, and then hope that one of them manages to get through?”

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly. For long run population maintenance, or for a constant, long run, stable population, you really only need the parents to be replaced by offspring. So when you have, you know, a spider that’s laying a thousand eggs, we would have a constant overrun of animals if the majority of them ended up surviving. And so you would expect that every season, the majority of them actually end up dying.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So it’s like, I think hunter-gatherers had like a 30% infant mortality rate, whereas I guess spiders it’s like 99.9%. So it’s like a thousand die for every one that makes it though.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly.

Robert Wiblin: This would be an argument that there’s more suffering in nature than there is pleasure, if, I guess, we think that these … Well, I guess one thing would be they’ve got to be conscious, these small creatures, and then conscious to some significant extent, I guess, including these tiny offspring that might not be, yet, fully developed. And I guess also it has to be the case that they actually do suffer when they’re dying, or they don’t enjoy whatever food they eat during their very brief lives enough to offset the pain of dying. Do we have any sense on weighing up those questions, or do you just want to punt that to future research?

Persis Eskander: I mean, I think the big, open questions that we don’t really have answers to … I mean, one thing that I really want to see people who are working on this, or people who might be interested in working on this, doing is getting a better sense of, do we know whether these animals actually have morally relevant experiences, and if they do, at what point.

Persis Eskander: I mean, a large part of what makes this argument compelling is that we expect juvenile animals to also be as sentient as adults. And it’s really not clear that … For example, at what point do we determine that an animal in development is complex enough to be able to experience something like pain? I mean, with oviparous animals, it’s pretty complex as well, because do we measure it from the moment the egg is laid? Do we measure it from the moment the egg hatches? Do we measure it while animals are still in development? There’s a lot of different phases, and it’s really not clear when, if at all, they develop the capacity to feel pain.

Persis Eskander: So these are really important questions that I would love people to start working on, but unfortunately I really don’t have a good sense of what the answers to those might be right now.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah. This is the whole point, that it’s very neglected. There’s not many people looking into those questions. You said under 20, you think of as looking into all of this, kind of all together? Does that include academics who are incidentally looking into it?

Persis Eskander: No. So I’m not really including academics who are doing empirical work in biology that could be incidentally useful to what we’re doing. I’m talking about people who are value aligned, and really focused on trying to improve the welfare of wild animals.

Robert Wiblin: It sounds like there are papers that you can draw from, from ecology or other areas, that are actually quite useful here but weren’t designed for that purpose.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, but there’s a limited number. I mean, there’s a lot of information out there, and so there would be a lot of value in doing a lot of literature reviews just to get a sense of what information we do have, so where the current state of knowledge is. But, I mean, it is limited in the sense that we only really get information on the reality of what happens. We don’t get any assessment or analysis on what the welfare effects of certain experiences are, or of certain events are. And that’s what we really need more work on, because we can’t really make decisions as to whether or not animals have net negative or positive lives without having a better sense of whether or not they have experiences that would contribute to that.

Robert Wiblin: Now that reminds me of … I guess you’d expect insects to be pretty stupid, and I suppose in a sense they are. But they have … Apparently a lot more of their body mass is brain than it is for us. So I guess you think of humans as having huge brains, but apparently ants, just a crazy fraction of their entire body is their nervous system, right?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I think Georgia also recently published a post on this … I’m going to be referencing Georgia a lot. She does a lot of great research … yeah, which found that it was surprising that small animals have larger brains relative to their body size. But it’s not super clear what that means in terms of how complex those brains are, and whether or not those brains are performing the sorts of functions that we would consider morally relevant as well.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Do you know what the engineering reason is, why ants have to have such big brains compared to their legs and stuff?

Persis Eskander: No, unfortunately I don’t. But I’d love to learn that.

Robert Wiblin: I wonder if it’s something like, well, in order to take any actions, you have to have a brain of a particular processing capacity. And as the body gets smaller you just can’t shrink the brain any more because otherwise it just wouldn’t be able to act as an ant. I don’t know, something like that, something like you get economies of scale on brain size. Our bodies have arms and legs like ants do, but doing a whole lot of other stuff as well. But there’s kind of just a bare minimum of processing power, I guess. Could be something like that.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, possibly. I do think that one thing that Georgia found in that post was that smaller brains are actually more efficiently designed, so they can contain a lot more neurons in a smaller space. Before reading that post, I had previously thought that human brains were the most efficiently designed in terms of the folds of the brain and the fact that we can contain so many neurons relative to the size. So that was really interesting. And I would be curious to learn if those brains being more efficient in terms of size means that they also are, maybe, more complex than we had initially thought.

Robert Wiblin: I guess, quickly, to make things more concrete, are there any kind of illustrative ways that we could try to help wild animals today that could conceivably actually be worth rolling out?

Persis Eskander: Yeah. Like I said, I wouldn’t recommend a large scale actions right now, primarily just because we don’t understand the flow-through effects. But I do think there are a few short term things that we could be doing.

Persis Eskander: So one thing I think is really promising is looking at the effects on wild animals of activities that humans already engage in. And there are a lot of these that don’t really fall into any particular category, like I call them the problems that have fallen through the cracks.

Persis Eskander: So for example, one might be can we improve the way wild caught fish are slaughtered? That’s really interesting because it intersects with the interests of people who also care about animals that are consumed. But it’s not really farmed animal welfare. And people often disregard fish, or they’re just like … They’re not very charismatic. They’re aquatic species, so we don’t interact with them often. And so they’re kind of like a forgotten category of animal. And so it would be really interesting, I think, if we were thinking about … Well, the current process is really inefficient. If fish have the capacity to suffer, and there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that they might, then why aren’t we thinking of better systems that can kill them painlessly? That would be an incremental change in terms of the whole problem, the whole wild animal welfare issue, but it would still be a largely positive change because it would affect billions of animals. And that’s a huge change when you’re just talking about the standard scale of problems that we work on.

Persis Eskander: Another one might be how can we improve the humaneness of rodenticides and pesticides? There are a lot of animals that, as a result of urbanization, now live in cities, animals like pigeons, rats, to some extent foxes and squirrels as well in some places. And they are often animals that are subject to poisonous gases or baits to either deter them or to get rid of them. And those can be really cruel. They can be pretty excruciating. They die through internal bleeding, or organ failure, or asphyxiation. And so it seems as though, if people are not going to be happy sharing their homes with rats, then maybe we should find a way to more humanely reduce their populations, or eliminate their populations. And one way we could do that is through immunocontraceptives. That would, again, be a pretty positive … a robustly positive change for wild animals, but one that doesn’t really face the same issues that the sorts of large scale interventions do.

Robert Wiblin: What’s an immunocontraceptive?

Persis Eskander: My understanding is that it basically creates sterility through the immune system. It kind of-

Robert Wiblin: It gets the immune system to destroy the testes or something like that?

Persis Eskander: Exactly, yeah. It tricks the body into thinking that they are sort of external and shouldn’t function the way they are supposed to.

Robert Wiblin: It’s tricksy. It’s clever.

Persis Eskander: That’s like a really … it’s a really terrible explanation for what actually happens. But that’s my layman’s understanding.

Persis Eskander: A third way, which is one that I think not many people have paid attention to so far, is like preventing the development of insect farming, especially if it begins to look, at some point, like it might be more cost-effective than grain as feed for livestock. I actually don’t think it is at that point. I’m not sure if it ever would get to that point. But if it did, then what we could end up doing is dramatically increasing the amount of suffering, presuming we think insects can suffer, if we started farming them on a massive scale for feed. And since that’s not something that we’re doing right now, it seems like it would be easier to prevent it from becoming something that humans do than it would be to try and backtrack once it’s become established in industrial agricultural practices.

Persis Eskander: So yeah, those are just a few examples of things that I think we could pretty easily start working on now, and that are quite robustly positive.

Robert Wiblin: The low hanging fruit is to just avoid humans going in and making things worse. That’s like the less controversial way that we can try to help wild animals.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, basically. I mean, the biggest considerations that stop us from doing large scale work right now are population considerations. So we don’t understand what large adjustments to populations will do. And since these focus on changes that we are already making, we’re not contributing to that. We’re just slightly changing what we’re already doing at the same scale that we’re doing it.

Robert Wiblin: I see. Okay, so you don’t try to change population numbers. You just try to change how much suffering there is involved in the population level being changed, in effect?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly.

Robert Wiblin: I suppose you’ve switched from working on wild animals to working on farm animals mostly. How does this compare in terms of, perhaps, expected impact or the nature of the work?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, it’s kind of hard to do a comparative analysis of the two, mostly because I think they’re at totally different stages. I mean, the sort of work we’re doing in farmed animal welfare focuses a lot on implementing really tractable, successful, cost-effective interventions. The biggest hurdle in farmed animal advocacy is probably resources and access to good quality research. But with the wild animal welfare, it’s a totally different stage. It’s such early days and mostly, what people are trying to do is just get a foundational understanding of the problem. I wouldn’t really say I would measure the impact of the work people do in wild animal welfare in terms of years of suffering reduced. It’s more like, how much value of information can we get from this which, in expectation, we hope will reduce a lot of years of suffering.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, and so because they’re at these different stages, it’s kind of hard to sort of compare the impact that the two might have. I also just generally think they’re both really important. And that it doesn’t really make a huge amount of sense to try and compare them because they’re sort of two subsets of this umbrella called animal welfare. And basically, our goal regardless of which area you tend to focus on is to just improve the welfare of animals as a whole. And these are just two different ways that we might try and do that.

Robert Wiblin: What made you switch?

Persis Eskander: So I think for me, it was mostly that I felt my skills and my personal fit was better in farmed animal work. I think ideally what we want for people who are working in wild animal welfare is for them to have a really strong background in life sciences and that’s unfortunately not me. So when I started working on wild animal welfare, it was much more neglected than it is now. I mean, when I was working on it, I would say there was less than $100,000 going into the field. But in the last two years, we’ve seen a lot of people who are really interested, who have backgrounds in zoology or backgrounds in ecology and biology who have become really interested in doing this work. And I basically want to give them the space to develop the research in the way that they think best because they are the people that I hope will become the main experts.

Robert Wiblin: All right. Let’s move on to talking about some kind of common objections that people often raise and that potentially people listening might be thinking about in their head. Are there any compelling arguments for humanity not dedicating much or any resources to trying to help out wild animals that you think are legitimate and that you take seriously?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I think there are probably a few compelling arguments. I mean, the most obvious one is that we’re uncertain as to the sentience of animals. And I mean, if we expect that a core amount of the problem focuses on the largest number of animals and the largest number of animals are also the least cognitive and complex, then if we were to conclude that they weren’t sentient, that would probably dramatically reduce the scale of the problem. And I think just on the question of sentience, I mean, it’s pretty difficult to try and answer. I’m not sure how we would come to a confident conclusion one way or the other as to sentience. But a great resource for example is a report that Open Phil published a couple of years ago on consciousness of moral patienthood which, I think, does a really excellent job of highlighting just how difficult it is to get a sense of what it means for an animal to have morally relevant experiences.

Persis Eskander: So that would probably be like a pretty compelling case against focusing on wild animal welfare. Another might be that we don’t actually know how wild animals experience things like predation, injury and disease. So there is a case, for example, that it’s just … I mean, as we discussed, it’s not as bad as we think it is because they’ve developed coping mechanisms, because the chronic experiences for them are just less negative for some reason. It could also be that for example when animals experience some kind of severe bodily trauma, they enter shock and so they don’t actually feel the pain. I mean, there are a lot of ways in which we just lack a lot of knowledge on what it means for animals to have experiences that we think would be bad for ourselves.

Persis Eskander: And so that would be a compelling case against focusing on wild animal welfare if we thought that what we traditionally think of as negative experiences, were not negative enough to sort of outweigh the positive experiences that we hope they’re having. And so if the ratio is much more balanced, then it might mean that it’s just not as severe a problem as we thought.

Persis Eskander: And then the last argument that I think is probably the most compelling one is that it’s just too complex a problem to work on. And that there is nothing we can really do about it.

Robert Wiblin: Actually, I think my mom talked at some point about … We have dogs and they have cut themselves various times and then they get surgery, get stitched up. And she’s remarked that they’re running around a day after the surgery and just seem fairly unbothered. So I suppose some people think that humans extraordinarily will see animals that suffer much more and I guess wild animals are like much more capable of dealing with the vicissitudes of life ’cause maybe the environment is just so much harsher that they kind of have to. They don’t wanna be constantly distracted and unhappy about how bad things are. I guess I’m kind of skeptical about it.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I mean I guess a contrary argument you could make is that just because animals don’t express their distress in a way that’s familiar to us or in the way that we would expect, it doesn’t mean they’re not feeling it. But it might actually be safer for animals to be better at hiding their injuries or be better at not signaling that they’re weaker because it makes them less likely to be prey. And I mean, obviously, everything we talk about is really speculative. It’s really hard to know if that is actually the case or not.

Persis Eskander: But I would be weary of, I guess, into reading too much into whether or not animals express their pain in a way that we would expect because it might just be that we’re overlooking something or there’s just a massive communication barrier there.

Robert Wiblin: They have a different love language, right? That suffering language in this case. Another one you raised was the question of are these animals sentient? Obviously, a super hard question. Luke Muehlhauser, one of your colleagues now at The Open Philanthropy Project has written this huge report that I think we’ve mentioned on the show before that we’ll stick up a link to. I guess, if you have like 20 hours of spare time to read through that and all the footnotes where they try to figure out, do we have anything to go on here? I think that the bottom line is, yeah, no, we are super uncertain. I guess people have different judgements.

Robert Wiblin: I suppose I find myself on the end of finding it quite plausible, very plausible that most mammals, for example, and fish have feelings that I take seriously perhaps more than most other people do that insects might well even have feelings. Although I find that very hard to judge. Did you find that people who are involved in this kind of project tend to be on one side of the distribution on how likely they think it is that animals, and especially small animals, are conscious?

Persis Eskander: I’m not sure. I’ve heard people who have been working on this express the view that they’re more likely to give credence to small animals having the capacity to feel pain. And people who seem pretty confident that they don’t and so tend to just wanna focus on other solutions to the problem or focus on slightly larger species but species that are still pretty unpopular. My impression is that perhaps people who work in wild animal welfare are just more willing to follow the precautionary principle and just avoid inflicting harm if they can which doesn’t necessarily say much about their probability that small animals are sentient. But I think it’s maybe they’re willing to pay a higher cost even if there is no payoff at the end.

Robert Wiblin: So they’re more just like running the math, you mean, or willing to take a big risk?

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I mean, they’re willing to sort of make decisions that might be more costly or might mean that we don’t do things that might be the most efficient thing that we do just because it could potentially cause harm but might actually end up having zero positive impact because they’re not capable. The animals we’re trying to help are not capable of feeling harm.

Robert Wiblin: The objection I hear the most is the one that we’ve kind of already alluded to is that anything you do with the population number is gonna backfire. So you get rid of the predators to try to help the prey but the prey increase in number and then they start eating other things or they make things worse in some other way. Sounds like you take that argument pretty seriously? Do you wanna present it maybe in its strongest form?

Persis Eskander: So I guess I could sort of run through a way in which it’s quite difficult to understand the next sign of an intervention that we try and implement. So, for example, Georgia, again, did a really interesting project looking at the potential effects of replacing the consumption of fish by the creation of alternative or cultured fish products. And so if we look, for example, at what this might mean for tuna fish, it becomes really quite complex when you go like only one or two steps in.

Persis Eskander: So tuna fish are both farmed and wild caught and so the first assessment we would wanna make is, well, are their farmed lives better than their wild lives. I mean, when they’re farmed, they’re in really close confinement, they often are susceptible to lice, they have really stressful de-lousing processes and then they are no humane provisions for handling transport and slaughter which could often be just blunt force trauma or decapitation or asphyxiation. Also, they will live for about a year or less. In the wild, tuna fish can live up to 15 to 30 years. Obviously, they don’t face problems like closed confinement but they might instead face problems like starvation. Tuna fish can be preyed on by whales and shark. There is some, I think, research to suggest that they have higher rates of parasitism in the wild as well.

Persis Eskander: So we might naively say, “Well, we think it’s slightly better to be a wild tuna fish than to be a farmed tuna fish.” And so then the next question you’d wanna ask is, well, if we want to think about replacing the consumption of wild caught tuna fish with alternative products, we need to think how bad is the death of a tuna fish in the wild versus being wild caught. And so tuna fish tend to be caught through a troll nets which can be quite stressful. And then they face the same sort of slaughter provisions as farm tuna. So there is no humane provisions. It’s often something like blunt force trauma or asphyxiation. It’s pretty unclear, though, how you would decide, whether that was better or worse than dying because you’ve been hunted or eaten, especially because the way fish are hunted and eaten is very different to what we would expect from terrestrial animals.

Persis Eskander: And then the next thing you’d wanna think about is, well, okay, let’s say we think it’s plausibly better that we don’t consume fish. Actually, no, let’s say it’s plausibly better that we do consume them, what would that mean? Well, if we say stopped farming fish and only ate wild caught fish, then we might expect to see the population of tuna drop. And tuna fish are also predators. So that might mean that the population of their prey ends up ballooning. But actually, most fish are predators and so what we might see is that the prey of the prey end up becoming depleted. And it’s not really a simple case to say that, well, if we’re like deplete this population that that might be a good thing because they tend to have really negative lives because often, if you deplete one population, what you end up seeing is that another population comes and takes its place.

Persis Eskander: So there are all of these different effects. And there are all of these different stages at which we just are very uncertain about what it means for the tuna fish’s prey population to increase. What does that mean for the quality of their lives. What are their experiences like? And what does it mean for the prey’s prey to then be depleted? What would take its place? It’s really, really difficult to understand, first of all how this trophic cascade works and then to make an assessment of how good or bad it is at various levels.

Persis Eskander: I think on this, Brian Tomasik actually has a really interesting article. I think it’s called Trophic Cascades caused by fishing. And that goes into much more detail. And I thought that was really an interesting read. So I guess that’s just one way to illustrate how difficult it is to get a sense of what their ecosystem effects are.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah. We’ll stick up a link to that essay if people wanna learn more about fish trophic levels. There’s this famous interview, or at least famous to me, an interview between Tyler Cowen and Peter Singer where I think Tyler points out, so if you’re vegetarian and you’re choosing not to eat animals that are made in factory farms, that kind of makes sense ’cause if you eat more of them, then you get more of them created. It’s like, Singer, what about catching these wild caught fish? And he says, “Oh, it would be wrong ’cause you’re killing them and eating them.” And he’s like, “But they’re gonna die of starvation or be preyed upon in the sea anyways, so you’re not changing the number of animals that die there.” And then I think seems like Singer hadn’t really thought about this. This is a little while ago, 10 years ago, before this issue had been raised more.

Robert Wiblin: And he’s like, “Oh, but then you end up with less of them.” And he was like, “But are their lives good? Are you saying it’s like the tuna are having a good time in the sea and that having fewer tuna would be a bad thing?” What’s the evidence base for that? Why do we think it’s bad for there to be more tuna? And if you think it’s like, the life of the tuna is good, so we shouldn’t catch them then surely catching the tuna such that the tuna doesn’t hunt all of these other animals, so you end up with more fish. ‘Cause that would be good then, right? Because you’re getting rid of the predator. So it’s like the same kind of thing of like, at every point you kind of don’t know what to say. Is being caught by a human worse than the death that a fish would otherwise suffer? There’s so many different interactions here and so many different things we don’t even know whether it’s positive or negative to figure out what actions to take is incredibly hard..

Robert Wiblin: All of that said, I think I’m somewhat less sympathetic to this argument than some other people are. I think it rests on, or for many people in their mind, it rests on this misunderstanding of what nature is like where they imagine that there’s some longstanding stable state where the number of animals or the ratios between all of these different animals is fixed and whenever you get a pertubation to that, that’s undesirable and then hopefully, at some point, it will restored back to its natural, good equilibrium. ‘Cause if you actually study biological systems, if you actually study some ecosystem, you see that there are numbers of different species and the ratios between them are just flying around chaotically all the time.

Robert Wiblin: One species will take over or they increase in number and then they’ll be hunted away and this changes year to year, month to month. So it’s not as if there’s some stable thing that’s like, “Great, we can’t destroy this wonderful situation that we know is ideal.” It’s really just flying around all the time and yes, humans mess with it but so do lots of other species like increase in number and then catch other species. I guess I’m less nervous about interference than perhaps other people are because I just view it as like humans are just one among many other things that are changing the number of different animals at any point in time and there’s no particular reason to think that our interventions are gonna be especially harmful.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I don’t think I’m very sympathetic to the idea that we can’t intervene because anything we do will throw the ecosystem out of balance. I think that if you conceive of the problem as there’s this huge problem, it’s too difficult to do anything because anything we try and implement on a really large scale has these unforeseen effects. Then I can understand why inertia sets in. I think I’m more sympathetic to the idea that whilst we’re very uncertain, we should be cautious. And we should be reluctant to engage in an action that could have potentially negative effects. And so what I sort of prefer is rather than seeing the potential solutions to the problem as this binary of, “Well, we solve a large part of the problem or we solve none of it,” we could just break it down into subsets and try and just focus more on incremental change. And hopefully, while we implement incremental change and learn more about the problem, we will discover solutions that weren’t immediately obvious to us in the beginning.

Robert Wiblin: I guess not to pick on Peter Singer but another objection that he made, I guess, when someone raised the possibility of trying to help wild animals at a talk is I guess just to quote him, “For practical purposes, I am fairly sure, judging from humanity’s past record of attempts to mold nature to its own aims, that if we try to interfere, we’ll be more likely to increase the net amount of animal suffering if we interfered with wildlife than to decrease it. Lions play a role in the ecology of their habitat and we can’t be sure what the long-term consequences would be if we were to prevent them from killing gazelles. So in practice, I would definitely say that wildlife should be left alone.” What do you think of that argument? Kind of what we’ve done so far has been bad so we should be very cautious about interfering going forward?

Persis Eskander: I’m sympathetic to the idea that we should be cautious and I totally endorse the idea of not taking actions while we have massive uncertainties. I do think that I am not convinced that we will definitely increase suffering as opposed to reducing it if we interfere. Primarily, because we’ve never actually tried to help wild animals before, most of the ways in which we’ve interfered in the wild have been for our own gain. And we haven’t really paid attention to the effects that they have on wild animals. So I mean, I’m also uncertain that we could potentially do something positive but I guess I’m not convinced that we should be fairly certain that we won’t be able to have a positive effect for animals.

Robert Wiblin: And another one that I hear pretty often is that well, humans, we’ve kind of have a moral duty to help animals that are like pets or farm animals that we’re interacting with. In as much as wild animals are just not interacting with people at all, they’re just interacting with one another. We just don’t really have any moral duties to creatures that are just outside of our entire sphere of interaction. I guess it’s more a philosophical than practical objection, but yeah, what do you think of that one?

Persis Eskander: There are two ways I could answer this. And I intend my answer to stay as far away as possible from ethical theory because I’m just the furthest person from being a philosopher. So I guess the first response would be that I just disagree that we don’t have a duty to animals that are outside of our sphere of interaction. I think what’s at play here is an act / omission bias and it doesn’t seem to me to be compelling that just because we aren’t the direct cause of a negative experience, we don’t have a duty or we shouldn’t be interested in trying to alleviate that negative experience. That’s probably the first response.

Persis Eskander: The second response is, even if we assume that that claim is correct, I think that anywhere you try to draw the line, when you try and define which animals are within our sphere of interaction and which ones aren’t, I think would be pretty arbitrary. So often people think that because we don’t interact with wild animals or if they live in untouched land then we haven’t affected their lives. But that’s actually not true at all.

Persis Eskander: Any sort of urbanization or large scale agriculture necessarily has an effect on reducing, changing, removing the habitats of animals who used to live there. Those animals are then forced to either relocate or they end up potentially as a result of losing their habitats, their populations decrease. When animals have to relocate, that changes the balance of that ecosystem. And so even if you think about environments that have been totally untouched, anything that we do in adjacent regions will have an effect on that. If we build a dam, if we change the direction of a river, that changes where animals can access water and where plants have access to water which changes the way that ecosystem then functions.

Persis Eskander: I don’t think that there is a strong case that there are any animals that are outside of our sphere of interaction. I think we just have varying degrees of interaction with them. But essentially, we interact with all animals in some way and so we would have a duty to help them.

Robert Wiblin: If you’re a moral pluralist you might think, “Well, there’s many different reasons why we perhaps have moral reasons for action,” and say some of them might be because we have relationships with people or we’re engaged in some kind of cooperation with them that creates its own kind of ethical considerations. But, I imagine that most people will think all else equal suffering is bad. Even if there is weaker reasons to care about wild animals. Still, even if there is a creature that we haven’t had anything to do with that’s suffering horribly, we still have some reason even if not quite as strong a reason to try to help them out.

Robert Wiblin: Of course, I guess, to me, it just seems equally strong, to think that we have equal duties to wild animals as farm animals. I guess I know many listeners feel that way but perhaps not all of them. Another objection that I chased up from Jennifer [Ever 00:49:16] which I think might occur to people in one form or another is the idea that consequentialists or utilitarians might actually wanna endorse evolutionary selection, the survival of the fittest because even though it’s quite unpleasant to go through, it’s the only way that you can get rid of deleterious genetic traits. So if we try to stop the survival of the fittest, then this would basically result in just gradual deterioration of the capabilities of the organisms that were left remaining ’cause you’d be allowing genetic diseases to propagate and spread because the carriers of those weren’t being removed from the population. Sounds a little bit brutal but I guess probably a lot of people think something like that about the wilderness. Did you have any reaction to that?

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I think that’s a really interesting objection. I haven’t actually read the paper that it comes from. So basically, my responses will be purely in the context of that quote. I think that what’s interesting is the distinction between a scenario where the survival of the fittest or evolutionary selection allows for a better scenario than one without evolutionary selection. And one where we claim that the current scenario is the best possible one. So I agree that in some sense, allowing animals to only propagate if they are the strongest and the fittest probably does lead to healthier populations. But I don’t necessarily think that species health is the same as individual wellbeing. And I think that’s a pretty risky link to draw because then you essentially end up conflating the individual experiences with species which, as a category, doesn’t have the capacity to have positive or negative experiences.

Persis Eskander: So that’s the first concern. And then the second concern is that just because evolutionary selection is better than a scenario without one, it doesn’t seem to me as though we can’t still improve on it. And so I’m not really sure why our attempts to try and improve the situation of wild animals couldn’t actually result in an outcome that’s even better than the status quo.

Robert Wiblin: A middle ground might be that you could say sterilize the weak organisms or something so they don’t propagate their genes but they don’t have to die in some horrible way.

Persis Eskander: Or, ideally, we could just prevent a lot of animals that are unlikely to survive from being born at all. I mean, I think one of the cruelest effects of the current system or the status quo is that a lot of animals are born but then die very shortly afterwards or they might live slightly longer but then they don’t get to reproduce because they’re weaker or they have genetic defects. I mean, I think it would be much kinder if there were a scenario in which they never had to exist at all.

Robert Wiblin: So you’re saying we could just have some kind of birth control, produce a more reasonable number and then the survival rate will go up. So you don’t have the 99.9% infant mortality rate but you still get plenty of selection, potentially at later stages. It just involves less mass death.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly.

Robert Wiblin: Another more simple objection that I get a lot from people who I don’t directly work with or are part of Effective Altruism is just why would you wanna interfere with nature. Nature is natural, that means it’s good. Changing it, that’s bad. Maybe I’m strawmanning that position. But, do you have any comment on that kind of thing? It’s like I guess this whole naturalness sphere of concerns.

Persis Eskander: I mean, I guess I would be curious how they define nature because it doesn’t seem to me as though there is a really world-defined concept of what is natural.

Robert Wiblin: It’s what’s there, Persis. Why would you ever wanna change anything that has been around for a long time?

Persis Eskander: Well, I would expect that people who truly buy into a belief system that places some kind of intrinsic value on nature would have to be willing to give up their homes and stop living in cities and stop-

Robert Wiblin: Record a podcast, unnatural.

Persis Eskander: Making use of … Exactly. Stop making use of technology because none of these are natural. It’s very difficult to give a very good response to an argument that is not extremely well defined. It’s very difficult for me to get a sense of what people actually mean when they say nature is good and changing it is bad because we make changes to nature all the time that have been to our benefit. And we will keep doing so.

Robert Wiblin: As you can probably tell, I’m not a huge fan of this objection. I suppose, yeah, you can cash it out into more concrete things like, “This is a thing that has persisted for a long time and has its own order and so interfering with that might be expected to be bad.” But I think many people, they’re not even thinking through to some kind of more consequential or practical argument and spitting out of this is just this is how things have been for millions or billions of years and so humans have no place changing this thing. But it just seems like absolutely fundamentally flawed reasoning. There’s no reason to think that something just because it’s been around a long time is good. It could also be terrible. And like humans have done all sorts of things like changed the way that humans used to live ’cause we thought it was bad. You know, we used to have slavery, used to be starved to death all the time. We changed that because it was bad.

Robert Wiblin: I guess this one actually often shows up on the left, the naturalness of nature thing. But I don’t think they’d accept a similar argument about different sexual practices or unnatural … I guess, people on the conservative are more likely to say, “Oh, homosexuality is bad ’cause it’s unnatural.” I think they’re factually wrong about that. But even if they were factually right that it was unnatural, I think we wouldn’t accept that that’s a good reason to discourage it or ban it. You have to have some greater objection to something other than that it hasn’t been what has typically happened before. It’s just not a good argument.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I agree. I would be surprised if someone who believed that what is natural is good held that as their sole belief as opposed to potentially being one belief amongst a mixture of other values that they constantly … And they constantly have to make tradeoffs between them and I think if you’re going to be engaging in that tradeoff, then what they’re essentially doing is saying, “Well, I would like to change nature when it benefits me, but, I don’t think I’m gonna change nature when there is no benefit or when it has zero effect on my life.” And I think that’s where the main flaw comes in that they’re just disregarding the experiences of wild animals.

Robert Wiblin: Another flavor of this is, “Oh, it’s natural and it’s beautiful,” some kind of aesthetic thing about how I guess humans have evolved to find nature really aesthetically pleasing ’cause that was the environment or at least some forms of nature, ones in which humans are able to survive very well, we find beautiful. I guess I often find that people confuse aesthetics and ethics. And this is another case where it’s like, something can be beautiful to humans, that’s affected by what humans like looking at. They’re not really affected by what is good in itself. You can have a wilderness that have a lot of suffering and it’s quite barbaric and the fact that it looks like a nice painting is kind of irrelevant morally, or only a tiny factor in the scheme of things.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I guess for people who strongly wanna preserve nature because it’s aesthetically pleasing to them, again, I guess there’s a tradeoff that I would be asking them to make. I mean, to what extent does the aesthetic pleasure you get from nature outweigh the horrible suffering experiences that animals have. And well, I mean, I’m sure some people would say that the aesthetic pleasure they get out of it does outweigh the suffering experiences but I guess I don’t really have a huge amount of credence in an argument like that.

Robert Wiblin: Now, I guess I wanna move on to how this plays with longtermism. And I guess the reasons that I don’t personally prioritize wild animal suffering that much. So I guess, yeah, what are the arguments for prioritizing wild animal suffering from a longtermist perspective? Is there much of a case for that that it improves the very long-term future of humanity and all of our descendants and the universe as a whole?

Persis Eskander: So I’m much less familiar, I would say, with longtermist perspective than maybe a lot of EAs or maybe even a lot of listeners. It’s not really an area I’ve spent a huge amount of time working on. But I would say, so the first thing I’d say is that, and it’s probably pretty obvious, is that if you do prioritize long-term outcomes, then I don’t actually think it makes sense to focus on wild animal welfare because what you’d wanna focus on are the most important leverage points and wild animal welfare is just not one of those. So I don’t think … I don’t wanna make a case that people who really care about the value of the long-term future should be working on this ’cause I don’t think that’s true.

Persis Eskander: I do think that there is a point at which it makes sense for people who take a longtermist perspective to sort of include wild animal welfare within the remit of the broad actions that we could potentially take. But I also think that that probably largely depends on what you sort of see as being the most urgent risks that we need to attend to. So I guess-

Persis Eskander: … the most urgent risks that we need to attend to. So, I guess like a very simplified example is that like if you have really high probability of short AI timelines, then it probably makes sense for you to focus on putting all of your resources into technical AI safety work, and it makes less sense to do something broadly useful like focus on improving democratic process. But if you have much longer, like a higher probability in much longer timelines, then it’s probably a little bit harder to … it’s a lot harder to predict the technical work will have long run impact.

Persis Eskander: So, it makes more sense to just focus a lot more on the broad actions you can do to generally improve things at a societal level. I think in the latter scenario is where it might be interesting to include wild animal welfare, primarily because part of the value of a long term future is one that is as inclusive as possible and factors in the welfare of all beings that could potentially be moral patients. And a scenario in which wild animal welfare is not included could be one in which we need up with these catastrophic oversight.

Persis Eskander: So, there are probably two goals I would say to including wild animal welfare or to I guess prioritizing wild animal welfare as a concern for people who care about the long term. The first is that if we include that nonhuman beings have the capacity to suffer, no matter what form it takes, then we would hope that the value of the long term future implicitly includes the value of all of these lives. So actually, if we improved the state of wild animals now and as a consequence improved or at least factored in the value of any nonhuman life that could potentially exist in the future, then we would actually be increasing the total value of the long term future.

Persis Eskander: But even if we don’t include nonhuman life in the value of the long term future, then I guess that just instilling norms of inclusivity and compassion would be a pretty robustly positive things that we could do. And that’s pretty speculative and I don’t actually know that promoting wild animal welfare or working on it now would actually result in an outcome like that. But it’s like a fairly plausible case. And even in that scenario, I would imagine that the primary benefit from a long termist perspective is for humans, but what I would want for wild animal welfare is that we actually address it now.

Robert Wiblin: Okay. So, try to summarize that. I guess you’re saying if you think this revolutionary AI is gonna come about really soon and you’re gonna get big changes in the world very quickly, then it wouldn’t make so much sense to focus on wild animal welfare, ’cause you want to focus on these pivot points that are gonna happen soon enough that we should just be thinking about those. On the other hand, if you think that there is nothing like that, then focusing on wild animal welfare might be valuable because you get to change all those values and make sure the concerns of wild animals and other organisms in the future that are like wild animals would be taken into consideration in the very long term future. You’re like potentially changing the trajectory of human values or the kind of concerns that we would implement in this long term, much more advanced future.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I think that’s basically right.

Robert Wiblin: And I guess the reason to not focus on it would be that while it’s a very important issue, ’cause there’s so many wild animals that exist at any one point in time, it’s not quite that urgent. It’s a problem that is just gonna continue, in as much as humanity just continues in its current situation. It’s not a problem that’s going away any time soon, and it’s not a problem where if we don’t solve it now, then we never get to solve it or anything like that. If anything, it’s like getting easier to solve in future potentially. So, it’s one that we can just punt down to future generations or delay fixing, whereas potentially other things like the risk of nuclear war, if we don’t fix it now, then potentially we’ll never get the chance to do it because we’ll be totally screwed by it now.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, I think it’s probably right that wild animal welfare doesn’t have the same sort of urgency as like existential risk does. But I’m not, I guess I have some concerns about the idea that we could just leave it to future generations to work on, because I think the expectation that we have that they will do it depends on how likely we think it is that they will think wild animals are morally relevant in the future, and it seems pretty plausible to me that there are many scenarios in which we’ve overlooked things in the past and that if we’re not working on promoting the idea that we should be taking a really inclusive approach, then maybe they will overlook it in the future, even if it does become easier and more tractable to work on.

Persis Eskander: I think there’s probably a medium ground here where what the field of wild animal welfare looks like is, in 10 years, it’s something like advocates are lobbying key decision makers to make decisions that consider the effects that they would have on wild animals as opposed to it being the sort of field where there’s like a group of people who are working on solutions and then trying to implement them. That would actually be my ideal outcome, especially if we expect things to become more tractable down the line. But that does still require that we start working on the problem now because there are a lot of really important questions we need to answer to be able to make that case convincing.

Robert Wiblin: So in the future we’ll be able potentially to solve this problem, but the question is will we, and I guess we want to set ourselves up so that we’ll choose to do that even though it might be quite inconvenient or quite costly, or difficult or controversial or something like that.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly.

Robert Wiblin: I guess there’s also this concern that we might get, I guess over the last few centuries our values have shifted quite a lot from preindustrial society to where we are now. But I guess it’s conceivable that they could become more stable and harder to shift in future. I think probably that won’t happen, but it is possible that human values will become a lot more like static in future, in which case we would need to rush to improve them quickly before they start getting too stuck where they are.

Robert Wiblin: So, how much … people who are working on this problem, how much do they see it as mostly a vehicle for advocacy about not being complacent about how good the wilderness is and not being indifferent to the welfare of wild animals rather than actually trying to do anything to concretely help them right now for its own sake?

Persis Eskander: I’m not sure that I have a good sense of if there’s like a fair representation of what all the people who are working on this now are hoping. I would say that probably most of the people who focus on it have a new termists worldview and are probably really interested in actually alleviating the negative experiences or improving the welfare of wild animals, and that the potential benefits that it has for the long term future are sort of like the added bonus, whereas I guess if you take a long term perspective, then helping animals now is the added bonus and the value of the long term future is the goal.

Robert Wiblin: Is the real meat of the … not meat and potatoes, but at least potatoes. Yeah, do you think that this is like among the better kind of vehicles for moral advocacy? I guess if you’re just trying to think about, “Well, we want to improve the future by making humans care about the right things,” then yeah, does wild animal suffering stand out across the whole smorgasbord of possible topics that you could be raising with people and trying to shift their attitudes on?

Persis Eskander: I’m actually not sure. There are two ways to think about the new term work that we do as having an effect on encouraging a more positive shift of human values. There’s work where you’re just engaging in deliberate advocacy, you’re just trying to encourage people to become more inclusive or to expand their sphere of concern. And then there’s work that is just purely focused on trying to solve a problem. And as a result of that work, we start seeing traction and we start seeing change, and then when something becomes mainstream, people sort of shift their values in response to that.

Persis Eskander: I don’t really know which of the two is more effective. I would say that the work that we’re doing in wild animal welfare falls into the latter. The focus is not so much on telling people to start caring about wild animals. The focus is on trying to figure out what we can do about it and then basically trying to make that change happen, and hopefully as we start seeing that change happen, people get on board.

Robert Wiblin: I’ve noticed this phenomenon where if people think that nothing can be done about something and they think it wouldn’t be valuable to do it, are they kind of confused what’s practical with what would be desirable. So, it might be the best way to get people to actually worry about wild animals is to show them concrete ways that we could help and show them that it’s not impossible to fix, and then they would be motivated to actually think about it and care about it as a moral issue. ‘Cause I guess, not sure whether this is a justification, but an explanation might be that do you really want to think that something horrible is really important and a moral responsibility if in fact you can do nothing, then that’s just depressing and pointless. But then once you activate or do indicate, “Oh no, there are solutions to this,” then people will actually need to think about it on a more concrete level.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. And one really surprising benefit I would say to wild animal welfare is that there’s no really demanding or challenging ask that we have of people. Anything that we might think is like a viable or feasible change that we want to make, we’ll require asking … For example, if we’re talking about making fish slaughter more humane, that requires going to companies and encouraging them to introduce new provisions. If we’re trying to prevent the increase of insect farming, then it’s not like a decision that’s made on an individual level where basically again, either liaising with industry or with government, or with the people directly working on that.

Persis Eskander: So, it’s not the sort of cause area that is hard for people to get on board, because for every individual person, it doesn’t actually cost them very much to just agree.

Robert Wiblin: They don’t even have to stop eating meat.

Persis Eskander: Yeah, exactly.

Robert Wiblin: You’re not asking for any … you need a systemic or governmental or technological fix rather than like individual action.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. And I would expect that people would find it easier to say, “Yes, I support making this change that is better for these wild animals, even if it might incrementally increase the cost of something,” so introducing more humane pesticides might incrementally increase the cost of vegetables that they have to buy. But that process is pretty well hidden and it’s not immediately obvious, so it’s quite easy for people to say, “Yeah, I really care about rabbits in agriculture and I don’t want them to have to die in these horrible ways.”

Robert Wiblin: It’s only gonna cost them a few cents and some different poison.

Persis Eskander: Yeah.

Robert Wiblin: Do we have any sense of, has there been any public opinion polling on wild animals? What do people think now and I guess how far away are they from thinking the things that we’d ideally like them to think?

Persis Eskander: I don’t know if there’s been large scale public polling. I know there was like, animal charity evaluators did a few small scale surveys, but I’m not sure if they were just asking, “What is your impression of wild animal suffering?” I mean, it’s also kind of important how you communicate it, like I could imagine that people are really on board with the idea of helping an animal that’s been hit by a car, but not on board with eliminating lions. That’s just not an idea that I would want to get on board with. So, I guess it really depends on how you tend to communicate the concept of wild animal welfare and what you’re plausibly asking people to get on board with.

Robert Wiblin: I imagine this is, like out of all the issues that we talk about, one of the things that people thought about the very least. It’s not something that most people have really given much consideration to at all, in which case the initial framing, or the nature of the question that you ask will more or less determine kind of the answer that you get, and they might just not really have stable opinions at all. I suppose I am interested to get a sense of how do people respond to different questions, ’cause you might have heard on one of the episodes with Spencer Greenberg, he had all this opinion polling that he’d done on Mechanical Turk on what do people think about farmed animal welfare and I guess the biggest update for me was that I had thought that many people thought that farmed animals weren’t conscious, and so the justification for their horrible treatment was that they can’t feel anything, so it’s fine.

Robert Wiblin: But it seemed like that was actually an extremely minority view. Really, we’re talking less than five percent of people thought that pigs couldn’t feel pleasure or pain. Actually, people thought that their lives were good, it’s more that they were ignorant of the farming conditions and that they believe that pigs weren’t moral patients. And that’s kind of a big, that might shift your messaging quite a bit, just to get some basics of like what do people actually think. I suppose you might think, “Well, maybe the poll was asking leading questions.” I think Spencer was pretty responsible there. The questions are fairly neutral and didn’t lead people really that much one way or the other.

Robert Wiblin: But it might be, I guess it’s conceivable that we could do some polling on wild animal stuff and find that if you just ask the question the right way, people are like, “Oh yeah, it is bad that all these animals are dying at birth.”

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I would definitely say that the way you communicate probably plays a really big role in terms of how people respond, because there are ways of communicating wild animal welfare that are really intuitive and then there are ways that are counterintuitive. And I think that’s something that the wild animal initiative is hoping to work on, so they did some early and very small work on communication strategies and might be looking further into what are the most effective ways that we can have conversations on this, which I would love to see the output of. I’m really excited to learn more about that.

Robert Wiblin: I guess this raises the issue of it potentially being quite a risky thing to be working on, because if you’re among the first people framing this whole issue and pushing it out there, then talking about it the wrong way could be really harmful and fix in people’s minds a negative attitude about it. Is that something people worry about a lot and perhaps is one of the reasons that people are more just trying to do basic research rather than go out and do any kind of big campaigns?

Persis Eskander: I think that’s a pretty important consideration. You’re right. The way people communicate it could be like a sticking point that ends up being kind of detrimental in the future. But I would say maybe that the larger consideration for why maybe it’s not the right time to do really broad or mainstream public outreach is that we’re just not really at a point where we, I guess have a good sense of what the problem is, what the extent of the problem is, and it’s kind of risky to also communicate a problem without … especially one that is like, relies very heavily on scientific data to back it up without having the support of academics behind you. So, I’m pretty wary of just going out and saying to the public, “Here is something we should care about. You should be outraged that there is all of this suffering happening in the world and we have to do something about it,” if we don’t also have ecologists and biologists and psychologists behind us saying that yeah, there is really good evidence that this is actually what’s happening and that we should be able to do something about it.

Robert Wiblin: Do you have any advice for listeners who I guess might end up talking about this issue, about how they can frame it in such a way that it’s not off putting to people who they might be speaking with?

Persis Eskander: Well, I guess I can give advice based on the sort of approaches that I’ve tried to use. The general approach I try and take is that I change the way I frame the issue depending on the audience that I’m talking to and on what I expect them to care about the most. So, for example, if I’m talking to EAs, then I might focus a lot more on the scale of the problem, whereas if I’m talking to maybe animal advocates, I might focus a lot more on the experiences that animals have. Those are probably a bit cliched. But you know, the idea being that if you can get a sense of what people care about, you can try and find intersection points where there are existing values and then for lack of a better word, leverage those to communicate wild animal welfare in a way that isn’t going to be very off putting to them.

Persis Eskander: But unfortunately, I wouldn’t really say I have very general principles. I think there might be some content out there on this. I would probably check either the animal ethics website or the wild animal initiative website. I think they might have both done some work on this, but there are no clear general principles that come to mind. I tend to sort of take a case by case approach.

Robert Wiblin: So to me it’s really obvious that long termists, at least me and the people that I know personally, are concerned about the welfare of farm animals, including wild animals as well, and I guess other beings that might exist in future that are moral patients and have experiences as well. Do you think that we should make that clearer to the rest of the world as maybe something that we don’t talk about that much and I guess perhaps animal activists don’t understand where we’re coming from?

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I think that’s a really interesting question. It seems, so I guess based on my understanding anyway is that it seems as though a long termist perspective, it does implicitly include nonhumans in the worldview. I think that if I maybe put myself in the shoes of someone who works primarily on long termist issues, then maybe there’s a concern there that if you try and more widely emphasize that you’re talking about nonhumans, that it becomes much less certain what you mean. So, are you talking about biological animals that exist now? Are you talking about animals that will exist if we colonize space? Are you talking about animals that will exist on different planets? Are you talking about extraterrestrial biological life? Are you talking about artificial life? I mean, it’s pretty unclear. It’s very poorly defined what nonhuman means when you’re talking about the long term future.

Persis Eskander: And so I can imagine there’s like a tension there between wanting to have a very explicit and clearly defined concept of what you’re working towards that as a result means you try and avoid talking about things that you’re less certain about versus trying to be more explicitly inclusive in the way we communicate it. And I guess that’s maybe like a strategic call for people who spend a lot of their time thinking about the best ways to communicate long termist issues.

Robert Wiblin: Usually if you’re trying to get people to come around to a position that’s not super common, you want to kind of do it one at a time. I think usually rather than wrap it all up together. So, if you’re trying to get people to worry about how the world’s gonna be in thousands of years time, then usually just focus on that and don’t add in another odd thing. It’s like talking about animals in thousands of years time, that’s just piling one thing onto another. And likewise if you’re trying to get people to worry about farm animal welfare, you probably don’t open with farm animals in thousands of years time. You just do one and then do the other.

Robert Wiblin: But I guess that could lead to misunderstanding about what people actually … like somebody’s talking about farm animals, doesn’t mean that they don’t care about the future, it’s just that that’s what they’re talking about now, ’cause it’s easier to make one point at a time.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. I think that’s probably fair. Often when I talk about wild animal welfare work, I do talk about it within like a near termist perspective ’cause that’s what it’s most relevant to right now.

Robert Wiblin: So, in terms of us needing to do this moral advocacy now rather than just leaving it for the future, one reason would be that we won’t get the chance to change values in the future. I suppose another possible reason might be they think, “Well, we have the seed of people who are worried about this issue now, but it’s possible that that could just get extinguished and then there won’t be anyone around who worries about this in the future.” So, this set of ideas could die out and never really take off.

Robert Wiblin: I guess I feel a bit skeptical of this whole line of argument, maybe ’cause it feels like we were doing something for one reason and now we’re kind of justifying it on different grounds. It seems a bit more spurious. Maybe I’m also just temperamentally, I’m more inclined to think that we’ll get moral convergence and ideas that we’ll actually, in the long term we’ll get to the right answer and that it’s fairly unlikely that we’re gonna get to some situation where people will just, where we just stop deliberating on what’s morally good. So, fingers crossed, if this is correct, then people will eventually realize it and we don’t have to rush to get the right answer on this one accepted by most people right away.

Robert Wiblin: Yeah, and I guess the idea that concern for wild animal welfare will just die out and not really be revived, maybe just because it seems like such an intuitive idea to me. It’s very hard for me to imagine that happening. People who are more moral non-realists who don’t think that there’s any real truth to the matter here, perhaps people who think that ideas and ideology kind of just evolve in a more random way as such that they’re just flipping around chaotically and there’s not really any kind of convergent direction to them. I guess for those people, it might make more sense to focus on this issue and make sure that it persists soon and gets taken up by a lot of people sooner, ’cause it’s just a greater chance that we could fly off in some completely different moral direction and end up never returning to worrying about this as a species.

Persis Eskander: Yeah. These are really interesting ideas and I think they sound plausible, but it’s really hard to know. It’s really, really difficult to get a better sense of what is actually happening here.

Robert Wiblin: I imagine you’ve got to have a similar kind of agnosticism about this one, but what do you think of the odds that kind of we take wild animals, or kind of their equivalent to space hypothetically, if we were to go out to space? I know this is something that some wild animal folks worry about, is it’s not just about wild animals and similar creatures on

"We have 8 Congolese right now in one of our shelters and a dozen in Nuevo Laredo," said Dr. Hector Gonzalez during an April 4 meeting of the Laredo City Council. Gonzales is the director of the Laredo Health department, according to Breitbart.

"For them, my concern was Ebola," said Gonzalez, who added "But, we're on alert to check that."

The current Ebola outbreak in the DRC is the second deadliest in history, with 772 dead out of 1,220 confirmed cases since the outbreak was declared on Aug. 1, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of the latest fatalities, 24 people died in their communities and 18 died at Ebola treatment centers.

That said, WHO on Friday announced that the current outbreak does not yet constitute a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)."

Doctors without Borders and at least one Red Cross official disagree.

"Whatever the official status of this outbreak is, it is clear that the outbreak is not under control and therefore we need a better collective effort," said Doctors without Borders emergency manager Gwenola Seroux in a written statement. "What is most important now if we want to gain control of this epidemic is to change the way we are dealing with it."

Top Red Cross official Emanuele Capobianco told NBC News on Friday that he is "more concerned than I have ever been" over the current Ebola outbreak.

Another factor in the current Ebola outbreak is active skirmishes between local militant groups, while health workers have also come under attack. Many locals in the DRC also don't trust Western medicine, and many think that Ebola is a scam, or experiment. Reports have surfaced of villagers breaking their loved ones out of Ebola quarantine wards, and taking the infected bodies of their dead back home for burial.

Fortunately in the DRC, a new, unlicensed vaccine created by Merck (VSV-EBOV) has shown 97.5 efficacy, according to the DRC's national research institute (INRB) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The DRC's national research institute (INRB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) analyzed data collected from May 1, 2018, to Mar 25, which revealed a vaccine efficacy estimate of 97.5% (95% confidence interval, 95.8% to 98.5%) for Merck's as-yet unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine. Researchers looked at data from 93,965 people in 679 rings and 28,888 healthcare or frontline workers who were vaccinated. Only 71 of the vaccinated people got sick with Ebola, compared with 880 people during the same period who weren't vaccinated. Of the 71 vaccinated people who became ill, 15 had symptoms beginning 10 or more days after vaccination, a period when vaccinees are thought to protect. Fifty-seven people had symptoms that began 0 to 9 days after vaccination, an interval when no protection or partial protection is thought to be in place. -CIDRAP

Meanwhile back in Texas, Dr. Gonzalez said that 2,800 migrants have been released at a Laredo bus station over the past two and a half months, and that the city government is working with charity groups to conduct health screenings.

"We’ve had flu. We’ve had a couple of potential respiratory infections that could be communicable, but we ruled them out – [tuberculosis] and mumps," he said, adding: "TB is an ongoing issue in the state of Texas,’ the doctor explained. “Between Texas, California, and New York, we have 50 percent of the cases of TB and the border has the most. Brownsville has the biggest number of cases."

"We always have surveillance for different issues that I’ve expressed," Gonzalez concluded.
Elon Musk has been talking about a Tesla Model 3 feature called ‘Enhanced Summon’ for some time now, last week Tesla CEO said the feature will start rolling out within a week but according to his latest tweet it’s pushed a few weeks for a stable release.

Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 13 April 2019

Tesla has an Early Access Program where the participants get the latest software updates before the rest of the Tesla owners, one such program member shared the testing video of the Enhanced Summon feature via YouTube channel Like Tesla.

The previous version of this feature called ‘Summon’ was able to move the car only vertically without anyone in the driver’s seat, the feature proved useful for getting the vehicle in and out of tight parking lots and garage spaces.

With one of the latest Tesla software updates, Model 3 is now also able to use the Summon feature with the key fob which was only accessible through the Tesla Mobile App previously.

Dear Joel (Deadmau5/ Testpilot),

We have been through many adjustments throughout the years. None such as difficult as your smart mouth, or where we started. 💗 I’ll never forget the first time I heard your music. I was young. Still in my prime, and still full of futile exuberance. In my eyes, you changed electronic music forever. You set your own course. You set the bar. You made fun of us so-called “ravers” at that time. We didn’t care. You had us… all ears. We had never heard any electronic music like you, and likely never will again. You changed EVERYTHING.

You IDEALLY SHOULD have CLOSED Ultra for their 20th anniversary. (I was pretty vocal about this fact). We all know, you helped them build themselves (among other festivals) into the superpower of festivals that they are known as today. l, like many fans, waited in line for tickets to see every Cube, including the new Cube 3.0. I attempted to wait through the Illenial massacre of Ultra 2019. At my age now, I just couldn’t stomach it. It wasn’t PURE. It wasn’t how I wanted to see you. After I left, I watched from the live-stream as you threw a microphone and discussed your discourse as has become common for your genius acumen.

You were worth every bruise I have on my body, although I never made it to your Cube 3.0 opening. As a female that bruises easily, I was willing to go to war to see what new ambience you had in store. I watched through the roughest crowd I have ever encountered to see your set at Spring Awakening, and then the six-hour Testpilot mini cube set you had thereafter. My first Ultra you “filled in” for TheProdigy and remixed “Smack my Bitch Up” and I’ve never been more in awe of a set than the first time I ever saw you take over a stage. That was fucking ARTISTRY. I am arguably (a super) fan. I believe in you. (Luckily, I scooped up Red Rocks tickets to see you in the most notable environment I could ever deem suitable for such an elite artist).

I couldn’t care less what you say on social media. (Although, I’m proud you put the Twitter down). I ignore what you say in the world of video games that many electronic music fans, including my brother, can’t seem to tear themselves away from. (I don’t believe you mean to cause discourse with your words that are so easily taken out of context). I follow you for your depth of scope, your melodies, your music, your voice. (Who cares what Wikipedia journalists have to say today, really?) A voice you have done well to temper and adjust to the times of today. (Well done, by the way). As a journalist/fan, I couldn’t be more proud of what you have accomplished if I tried. Testpilot has grown to have your unique voice. Prydz has been great for you, and your Ultra set gave me LIFE. (I have been at every Testpilot set as a huge proponent of your alias’ sound). I haven’t danced like that in recent memory.

I have gone to the ends of America’s beautiful country to follow your best sets… and arguably, your worsts. I have wept as you have mended our seemingly musical relationship. I don’t care what the people reading think. (Ok, maybe a little). To me, you are the end all be all of all electronic artists. To me, you can do wrong, but with necessity. You give us the set we need, not necessarily, the set we want and deserve at the same time. I RESPECT that. True artistry comes from your pores. I know every track of yours like the back of my hand. No one can hold my true attention like you.

At any rate, I suppose today is #MCM, or Man Crush Monday. You are NOT just Man Crush Monday, as I am sure you are above a stupid HASHTAG. You are yourself. Flawed, as we all are. I have been here from day one and can say that following your career, even through some potential foleys, has been the joy of my electronic music career thus far. Joel, thank you.

Raise your Weapon: TheCube V3

The newest cube, created by deadmau5 with Chris Schroeder, with technical design by Collyns Stenzel, and video content plus additional programming by deadmau5 debuted at Ultra 2019. If you haven’t had the chance to see this live , you are in luck… he is taking it on tour. He wouldn’t leave us hanging. Make your plans to attend one or all of theses stops today. I’ll see you at Red Rocks, and Chicago, and even potentially New York.

What can I say? I will travel for pure unadulterated artistry. You should too.

Ein Prestigeprojekt von Ex-Bundesinnenminister Thomas de Maizière (CDU) und EU-Sicherheitskommissar Julian King hat das EU-Parlament am Dienstag befürwortet. Laut zwei beschlossenen Verordnungsentwürfen zur "Interoperabilität" sollen sämtliche EU-Datenbanken in den Bereichen Sicherheit, Grenzmanagement und Migrationssteuerung miteinander verzahnt werden. Zugleich kann die biometrische Überwachung der Bevölkerung und Einreisender deutlich ausgebaut werden.

Ziel ist es, unter anderem das Schengen-Informationssystem (SIS) mit rund 80 Millionen Einträgen, das Visa-Register (VIS) oder die Eurodac-Datei, in der vor allem Fingerabdrücke von Asylbewerbern gespeichert werden, über ein Suchportal zu verknüpfen. Dazu kommen werden etwa das neue Ein- und Ausreisesystem zur biometrischen Grenzkontrolle (Smart Borders) sowie das Europäische Reisegenehmigungssystem (ETIAS). Ermöglicht werden soll so ein Abgleich der vorhandenen Daten "mit einem einzigen Klick". Grenzschützer und Polizisten könnten künftig etwa Ausweise einfacher überprüfen, indem sie alle EU-Informationssysteme auf einem Bildschirm gleichzeitig abfragen.

Auch einen übergeordneten "Speicher für Identitätsdaten" sehen die Abgeordneten vor, eingeschränkt zunächst auf Angehörige von Drittstaaten. Einfließen sollen Informationen wie Geburtsdatum, Passnummer, Fingerabdrücke oder digitale Gesichtsbilder. Dazu kommt ein "gemeinsamer Dienst" für den Abgleich biometrischer Daten, mit dem anhand von Fingerabdrücken und Gesichtsbildern alle bestehenden Informationssysteme abgefragt werden können. Darüber hinaus soll ein "Detektor für Mehrfachidentitäten" für eine "unverzügliche Kennzeichnung aller Personen" sorgen, "die mehrere oder falsche Identitäten verwenden". Prinzipiell entsteht damit eine Biometrie-Superdatenbank, vor der Datenschützer gewarnt hatten. Das von den EU-Gremien im Februar geschnürte Paket muss noch den Ministerrat passieren, was als Formsache gilt. (anw)

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to take a case that sought to overturn a New Jersey law banning conversion therapy — a medically discredited practice of attempting to change a child’s sexual orientation from gay to straight.

That means the New Jersey ban will remain.

Licensed therapists in New Jersey have been prohibited since 2013 from engaging in reparative or conversion therapy for minors.

Then-Gov. Chris Christie signed the law citing statements from the American Psychological Association that said the practice “can pose critical health risks including, but not limited to, depression, substance abuse, social withdrawal, decreased self-esteem and suicidal thoughts.”

A religious group wants the Supreme Court to overturn N.J.'s ban on gay conversion therapy A ruling last June involving what abortion providers are allowed to tell patients has given hope to a conservative group.

But Liberty Counsel, a national religious legal organization, asked the nation’s highest court for a chance to prove New Jersey’s law violates the free speech rights of counselors who believe the treatment works.

Emboldened by the court’s ruling in June that found crisis pregnancy center owners had a First Amendment right not to refer women for abortions, Liberty Counsel intended to seek the same free speech argument for therapists, according to its Feb. 11 filing.

Garden State Equality, the state’s largest LGBT advocacy organization which had urged the high court to leave the law intact, praised the court’s action.

“In rejecting this case today, the Supreme Court recognized what every sensible and compassionate person across New Jersey and this country knows: anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy is dangerous, discredited malpractice," Garden State Equality Executive Director Christian Fuscarino said.

Fuscarino called the potential challenge "a stark reminder that the rights of LGBTQ people — even here in New Jersey — are constantly under attack.”

Sixteen states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have passed laws banning conversion therapy. New Jersey’s law would put in jeopardy any licensed counselor who uses the practice to treat minors. The law does not apply to clergy.

The American Psychiatric Association also has condemned the practice, which is “based on the assumption that homosexuality per se is a mental disorder.”

Never-Ending Nightmare

The Neoliberal Assault on Democracy

How do we explain the strange survival of the forces responsible for the 2008 economic crisis, the worst since 1929? How is it that the economic policies that created the Great Recession emerged stronger than ever? When the system broke, a number of the world’s most prominent economists hastened to announce that neoliberalism was over. But reports of its death were greatly exaggerated.



For Pierre Dardot and Christian Laval, neoliberalism is no mere dogma. Supported by powerful oligarchies, it is a veritable politico-institutional system, one capable of perpetuating itself aggressively. Far from representing a break, crisis has become a formidably effective mode of government.



Never-Ending Nightmare demonstrates that this political straitjacket has succeeded in preventing any course correction by deteriorating democracies. To make matters worse, the so-called governmental Left has actively helped strengthen this oligarchic logic. The result is to raise the possibility of a definitive exit from democracy in favour of technocratic governance, free of any control by ordinary citizens.



However, nothing has been decided yet. The revival of democratic activity, which we see emerging in the political movements and experiments of recent years, is a sign that the political confrontation with the neoliberal system and the oligarchical bloc has already begun.
When broadcaster Sandi Toksvig was studying anthropology at university, one of her female professors held up a photograph of an antler bone with 28 markings on it. “This,” said the professor, “is alleged to be man’s first attempt at a calendar.” Toksvig and her fellow students looked at the bone in admiration. “Tell me,” the professor continued, “what man needs to know when 28 days have passed? I suspect that this is woman’s first attempt at a calendar.”

Women have always tracked their periods. We’ve had to. Since 2015, I’ve been reliant on a period tracker app, which reassures me that there’s a reason I’m welling up just thinking about Andy Murray’s “casual feminism”. And then there’s the issue of the period itself: when you will be bleeding for up to seven days every month, it’s useful to know more or less when those seven days are going to take place. Every woman knows this, and Toksvig’s experience is a neat example of the difference a female perspective can make, even to issues that seem entirely unrelated to gender.

For most of human history, though, that perspective has not been recorded. Going back to the theory of Man the Hunter, the lives of men have been taken to represent those of humans overall. When it comes to the other half of humanity, there is often nothing but silence. And these silences are everywhere. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics, the stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future, are all marked – disfigured – by a female-shaped “absent presence”. This is the gender data gap.

These silences, these gaps, have consequences. They impact on women’s lives, every day. The impact can be relatively minor – struggling to reach a top shelf set at a male height norm, for example. Irritating, certainly. But not life-threatening. Not like crashing in a car whose safety tests don’t account for women’s measurements. Not like dying from a stab wound because your police body armour doesn’t fit you properly. For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.

The gender data gap is both a cause and a consequence of the type of unthinking that conceives of humanity as almost exclusively male. In the 1956 musical My Fair Lady, phoneticist Henry Higgins is baffled when, after enduring months of his hectoring put-downs, his protege-cum-victim Eliza Doolittle finally bites back. “Why can’t a woman be more like a man?” he grumbles.

When ‘women’s work’ is deadly

The formula to determine standard office temperature was developed in the 1960s around the metabolic resting rate of the average man. But a recent Dutch study found that the metabolic rate of young adult females performing light office work is significantly lower than the standard values for men doing the same activity. In fact, the formula may overestimate female metabolic rate by as much as 35%, meaning that current offices are on average five degrees too cold for women. This leads to the odd sight of female office workers wrapped in blankets in the summer, while their male colleagues wander around in shorts.

Not only is this situation inequitable, it is bad business sense: an uncomfortable workforce is an unproductive workforce. But workplace data gaps lead to a lot worse than simple discomfort and inefficiency. Over the past 100 years, workplaces have, on the whole, got considerably safer. In the early 1900s, about 4,400 people in the UK died at work every year. By 2016, that figure had fallen to 135. But while serious injuries at work have been decreasing for men, there is evidence that they have been increasing among women. The gender data gap is again implicated, with occupational research traditionally focused on male-dominated industries.

Every year, 8,000 people in the UK die from work-related cancers. And although most research in this area has been done on men, it’s far from clear that men are the most affected. Over the past 50 years, breast cancer rates in the industrialised world have risen significantly – but a failure to research female bodies, occupations and environments means that the data for exactly what is behind this rise is lacking. “We know everything about dust disease in miners,” Rory O’Neill, professor of occupational and environmental policy research at the University of Stirling, tells me. “You can’t say the same for exposures, physical or chemical, in ‘women’s work’.”

Cancer is a long-latency disease, O’Neill says, so even if we started the studies now, it would take a working generation before we had any usable data. But we aren’t starting the studies now. Instead, we continue to rely on data from studies done on men as if they apply to women. Specifically, Caucasian men aged 25 to 30, who weigh 70kg. This is “Reference Man” and his superpower is being able to represent humanity as a whole. Of course, he does not.

Men and women have different immune systems and hormones, which can play a role in how chemicals are absorbed. Women tend to be smaller than men and have thinner skin, both of which can lower the level of toxins they can be safely exposed to. This lower tolerance threshold is compounded by women’s higher percentage of body fat, in which some chemicals can accumulate. Chemicals are still usually tested in isolation, and on the basis of a single exposure. But this is not how women tend to encounter them.

In nail salons, where the workforce is almost exclusively female (and often migrant), workers will be exposed on a daily basis to a huge range of chemicals that are “routinely found in the polishes, removers, gels, shellacs, disinfectants and adhesives that are staples of their work”, according to the Canadian researcher Anne Rochon Ford. Many of these chemicals have been linked to cancer, miscarriages and lung diseases. Some may alter the body’s normal hormonal functions. If these women then go home and begin a second unpaid shift cleaning their home, they will be exposed to different chemicals that are ubiquitous in common products. The effects of these mixing together are largely unknown.

Most of the research on chemicals has focused on their absorption through the skin. But many of the ones used in nail salons are extremely volatile, which means that they evaporate at room temperature and can be inhaled – along with the considerable amounts of dust produced when acrylic nails are filed. The research on how this may impact on workers is virtually nonexistent.

Part of the failure to see the risks in traditionally female-dominated industries is because often these jobs are an extension of what women do in the home (although at a more onerous scale). But the data gap when it comes to women in the workplace doesn’t only arise in female-dominated industries.

Little data exists on injuries to women in construction, but the New York Committee for Occupational Safety & Health (NYCOSH) points to a US study of union carpenters that found women had higher rates of sprains, strains and nerve conditions of the wrist and forearm than men. Given the lack of data, it’s hard to be sure exactly why this is, but it’s a safe bet to attribute at least some of the blame to “standard” construction site equipment being designed around the male body.

A female police officer had to have breast-reduction surgery because of the health effects of wearing her body armour

Wendy Davis, ex-director of the Women’s Design Service in the UK, questions the standard size of a bag of cement. It’s a comfortable weight for a man to lift – but it doesn’t actually have to be that size, she points out. “If they were a bit smaller, then women could lift them.” Davis also takes issue with the standard brick size. “I’ve got photographs of my [adult] daughter holding a brick. She can’t get her hand round it. But [her husband] Danny’s hand fits perfectly comfortably. Why does a brick have to be that size?” She also notes that the typical A1 architect’s portfolio fits nicely under most men’s arms while most women’s arms don’t reach round it.

NYCOSH similarly notes that “standard hand tools like wrenches tend to be too large for women’s hands to grip tightly”.

In the UK, employers are legally required to provide well-maintained personal protective equipment (PPE) – anything from goggles to full body suits – to workers who need it, free of charge. But most PPE is based on the sizes and characteristics of male populations from Europe and the US. The TUC found that employers often think that when it comes to female workers all they need to do to comply with this legal requirement is to buy smaller sizes.

Differences in chests, hips and thighs can affect the way the straps fit on safety harnesses. The use of a “standard” US male face shape for dust, hazard and eye masks means they don’t fit most women (as well as a lot of black and minority ethnic men). A 2017 TUC report found that the problem with ill-fitting PPE was worst in the emergency services, where only 5% of women said that their PPE never hampered their work, with body armour, stab vests, hi-vis vests and jackets all highlighted as unsuitable.

When it comes to frontline workers, poorly fitting PPE can prove fatal. In 1997, a British female police officer was stabbed and killed while using a hydraulic ram to enter a flat. She had removed her body armour because it was too difficult to use the ram while wearing it. Two years later, a female police officer revealed that she had had to have breast-reduction surgery because of the health effects of wearing her body armour. After this case was reported, another 700 officers in the same force came forward to complain about the standard-issue protective vest.

But although the complaints have been coming regularly over the past 20 years, little seems to have been done. British female police officers report being bruised by their kit belts; a number have had to have physiotherapy because of the way stab vests sit on their body; many complain there is no space for their breasts. This is not only uncomfortable, it also results in stab vests coming up too short, leaving women unprotected.

The tyranny of the toilet queue

In April 2017, the BBC journalist Samira Ahmed wanted to use a toilet. She was at a screening of the James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro at London’s Barbican arts centre, and it was the interval. Any woman who has ever been to the theatre knows what that means. This evening, the queue was worse than usual. Far worse. Because in an almost comically blatant display of not having thought about women at all, the Barbican had turned both the male and female toilets gender neutral simply by replacing the “men” and “women” signage with “gender neutral with urinals” and “gender neutral with cubicles”. The obvious happened. Only men were using the supposedly “gender neutral with urinals” and everyone was using the “gender neutral with cubicles”.

Rather than rendering the toilets genuinely gender neutral, they had simply increased the provision for men. “Ah the irony of having to explain discrimination having just been to see I Am Not Your Negro IN YOUR CINEMA”, Ahmed tweeted, suggesting that turning the gents gender neutral would be sufficient: “There’s NEVER such a queue there & you know it.”

On the face of it, it may seem fair and equitable to accord male and female public toilets the same amount of space – and historically, this is the way it has been done: 50/50 division of floor space has even been formalised in plumbing codes. However, if a male toilet has both cubicles and urinals, the number of people who can relieve themselves at once is far higher per square foot of floor space in the male bathroom than in the female bathroom. Suddenly equal floor space isn’t so equal.

But even if male and female toilets had an equal number of stalls, the issue wouldn’t be resolved, because women take up to 2.3 times as long as men to use the toilet. Women make up the majority of the elderly and disabled, two groups that will tend to need more time in the toilet. Women are also more likely to be accompanied by children, as well as disabled and older people. Then there’s the 20–25% of women of childbearing age who may be on their period at any one time, and therefore need to change a tampon or a sanitary pad.

Women may also require more trips to the bathroom: pregnancy significantly reduces bladder capacity, and women are eight times more likely to suffer from urinary-tract infections. In the face of all these anatomical differences, it would surely take a formal equality dogmatist to continue to argue that equal floor space between men and women is fair.

The gadgets built for one-size-fits-men

In 1998, a pianist called Christopher Donison wrote that “one can divide the world into roughly two constituencies”: those with larger hands, and those with smaller hands. Donison was writing as a male pianist who, due to his smaller than average hands, had struggled for years with traditional keyboards, but he could equally have been writing as a woman. There is plenty of data showing that women have, on average, smaller hands, and yet we continue to design equipment around the average male hand as if one-size-fits-men is the same as one-size-fits-all.

The average smartphone size is now 5.5 inches. While the average man can fairly comfortably use his device one-handed, the average woman’s hand is not much bigger than the handset itself. This is obviously annoying – and foolish for a company like Apple, given that research shows women are more likely to own an iPhone than men.

One woman found her car's voice-command system only listened to her husband, even though he was in the passenger seat

The tech journalist and author James Ball has a theory for why the big-screen fixation persists: because the received wisdom is that men drive high-end smartphone purchases. But if women aren’t driving high-end smartphone purchases – at least for non-Apple products – is it because women aren’t interested in smartphones? Or could it be because smartphones are designed without women in mind? On the bright side, Ball reassured me that screens probably wouldn’t be getting any bigger because “they’ve hit the limit of men’s hand size”.

Good news for men, then. But tough breaks for women like my friend Liz who owns a third-generation Motorola Moto G. In response to one of my regular rants about handset sizes she replied that she’d just been “complaining to a friend about how difficult it was to zoom on my phone camera. He said it was easy on his. Turns out we have the same phone. I wondered if it was a hand-size thing.”

When Zeynep Tufekci, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, was trying to document tear gas use in the Gezi Park protests in Turkey in 2013, the size of her Google Nexus got in the way. It was the evening of 9 June. Gezi Park was crowded. Parents were there with their children. And then the canisters were fired. Because officials “often claimed that tear gas was used only on vandals and violent protesters”, Tufekci wanted to document what was happening. So she pulled out her phone. “And as my lungs, eyes and nose burned with the pain of the lachrymatory agent released from multiple capsules that had fallen around me, I started cursing.” Her phone was too big. She could not take a picture one-handed – “something I had seen countless men with larger hands do all the time”. All Tufekci’s photos from the event were unusable, she wrote, and “for one simple reason: good smartphones are designed for male hands”.

Voice recognition could be one solution to a smartphone that doesn’t fit your hands, but voice-recognition software is often hopelessly male-biased. In 2016, Rachael Tatman, a research fellow in linguistics at the University of Washington, found that Google’s speech-recognition software was 70% more likely to accurately recognise male speech.

Clearly, it is unfair for women to pay the same price as men for products that deliver an inferior service. But there can also be serious safety implications. Voice-recognition software in cars, for example, is meant to decrease distractions and make driving safer. But they can have the opposite effect if they don’t work. An article on car website Autoblog quoted a woman who had bought a 2012 Ford Focus, only to find that its voice-command system only listened to her husband, even though he was in the passenger seat. Another woman called the manufacturer for help when her Buick’s voice-activated phone system wouldn’t listen to her: “The guy told me point-blank it wasn’t ever going to work for me. They told me to get a man to set it up.”

Immediately after writing this, I was with my mother in her Volvo Cross Country watching her try and fail to get the voice-recognition system to call her sister. After five failed attempts I suggested she tried lowering the pitch of her voice. It worked first time.

In the tech world, the implicit assumption that men are the default human remains king. When Apple launched its health-monitoring system with much fanfare in 2014, it boasted a “comprehensive” health tracker. It could track blood pressure; steps taken; blood alcohol level; even molybdenum and copper intake. But as many women pointed out at the time, they forgot one crucial detail: a period tracker.

When Apple launched their AI, Siri, users in the US found that she (ironically) could find prostitutes and Viagra suppliers, but not abortion providers. Siri could help you if you’d had a heart attack, but if you told her you’d been raped, she replied “I don’t know what you mean by ‘I was raped.’”

From smartwatches that are too big for women’s wrists, to map apps that fail to account for women who may want to know the “safest” in addition to “fastest” routes; to “measure how good you are at sex” apps called “iThrust” and “iBang” the tech industry is rife with other examples. While there are an increasing number of female-led tech firms that do cater to women’s needs, they are seen as a “niche” concern and often struggle to get funding.

One study of 12 of the most common fitness monitors found that they underestimated steps during housework by up to 74% (that was the Omron, which was within 1% for normal walking or running) and underestimated calories burned during housework by as much as 34%. Meanwhile, Fitbit users have complained that the device fails to account for movement while doing the extremely common female activity of pushing a pram (and, yes, men push prams, too; but not as often as the women who do 75% of the world’s unpaid care).

How women are put at risk on the roads

Men are more likely than women to be involved in a car crash, which means they dominate the numbers of those seriously injured in them. But when a woman is involved in a car crash, she is 47% more likely to be seriously injured, and 71% more likely to be moderately injured, even when researchers control for factors such as height, weight, seatbelt usage, and crash intensity. She is also 17% more likely to die. And it’s all to do with how the car is designed – and for whom.

Women tend to sit further forward when driving. This is because we are on average shorter. Our legs need to be closer to reach the pedals, and we need to sit more upright to see clearly over the dashboard. This is not, however, the “standard seating position”, researchers have noted. Women are “out of position” drivers. And our wilful deviation from the norm means that we are at greater risk of internal injury on frontal collisions. The angle of our knees and hips as our shorter legs reach for the pedals also makes our legs more vulnerable. Essentially, we’re doing it all wrong.

Cars have been designed using car crash-test dummies based on the 'average' male

Women are also at higher risk in rear-end collisions. We have less muscle on our necks and upper torso, which make us more vulnerable to whiplash (by up to three times), and car design has amplified this vulnerability. Swedish research has shown that modern seats are too firm to protect women against whiplash injuries: the seats throw women forward faster than men because the back of the seat doesn’t give way for women’s on average lighter bodies. The reason this has been allowed to happen is very simple: cars have been designed using car crash-test dummies based on the “average” male.

Crash-test dummies were first introduced in the 1950s, and for decades they were based around the 50th-percentile male. The most commonly used dummy is 1.77m tall and weighs 76kg (significantly taller and heavier than an average woman); the dummy also has male muscle-mass proportions and a male spinal column. In the early 1980s, researchers based at Michigan University argued for the inclusion of a 50th-percentile female in regulatory tests, but this advice was ignored by manufacturers and regulators. It wasn’t until 2011 that the US started using a female crash-test dummy – although, as we’ll see, just how “female” these dummies are is questionable.

In 2018, Astrid Linder, research director of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, presented a paper at the Road Safety on Five Continents Conference in South Korea, in which she ran through EU regulatory crash-test requirements. In no test is an anthropometrically correct female crash-test dummy required. The seatbelt test, one of the frontal-collision tests, and both lateral-collision tests all specify that a 50th-percentile male dummy should be used. There is one EU regulatory test that requires what is called a 5th-percentile female dummy, which is meant to represent the female population. Only 5% of women will be shorter than this dummy. But there are a number of data gaps. For a start, this dummy is only tested in the passenger seat, so we have no data at all for how a female driver would be affected – something of an issue you would think, given women’s “out of position” driving style. And secondly, this female dummy is not really female. It is just a scaled-down male dummy.

Consumer tests can be slightly more stringent than regulatory ones. The 2011 introduction of female crash-test dummies in the US sent cars’ star ratings plummeting. When I spoke to EuroNCAP, a European organisation that provides car safety ratings for consumers, they said that since 2015 they have used male and female dummies in both front-crash tests, and that they base their female dummies on female anthropometric data – with the caveat that this is “where data is available”. EuroNCAP acknowledged that “sometimes” they do just use scaled-down male dummies. But women are not scaled-down men. We have different muscle mass distribution. We have lower bone density. There are differences in vertebrae spacing. Even our body sway is different. And these differences are all crucial when it comes to injury rates in car crashes.

The situation is even worse for pregnant women. Although a pregnant crash-test dummy was created back in 1996, testing with it is still not government-mandated either in the US or in the EU. In fact, even though car crashes are the No 1 cause of foetal death related to maternal trauma, we haven’t yet developed a seatbelt that works for pregnant women. Research from 2004 suggests that pregnant women should use the standard seatbelt; but 62% of third-trimester pregnant women don’t fit that design.

Linder has been working on what she says will be the first crash-test dummy to accurately represent female bodies. Currently, it’s just a prototype, but she is calling on the EU to make testing on such dummies a legal requirement. In fact, Linder argues that this already is a legal requirement, technically speaking. Article 8 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union reads, “In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women.” Clearly, women being 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car crash is one hell of an inequality to overlook.

Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men. It’s time to start designing women in.

Twenty years after President Bill Clinton fulfilled his vow to “end welfare as we know it,” it’s fair to say: mission accomplished. The old U.S. welfare system is dead. Whether the system that replaced it is better for the poorest Americans remains the subject of fierce debate.

The welfare reform bill that Clinton signed into law 20 years ago this month fractured the U.S. welfare system, from one managed mostly by the federal government to one largely directed by individual states. As each state became empowered to spend its welfare grant as it saw fit, one monolithic system devolved into 50 different ones — with far less money going directly to low-income families.

The 1996 reform didn’t result in a reduction in total spending on welfare, now known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Since 1998, the first year for which we have complete data, total TANF spending — both from federal block grants as well as required state matching funds — has remained essentially flat, after adjusting for inflation, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that is critical of welfare reform. Per-person spending has fallen, however: In 2014 there were about 12 million more people below the poverty level than in 1998, according to the Census Bureau. The U.S. population has grown nearly 20 percent during that time.

Perhaps the more significant change, though, is in how that money is being spent. Welfare reform replaced the old, federally run cash assistance program with a system of state-administered block grants. Under TANF, states can spend welfare money on virtually any program aimed at one of four broad purposes: (1) assistance to needy families with children; (2) promoting job preparation and work; (3) preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encouraging the formation of two-parent families.

Some states have interpreted those purposes — especially the last two categories — “very, very loosely,” said LaDonna Pavetti, a researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. After-school programs to reduce teen pregnancy, for example, can be funded through TANF block grants.

The result has been a dramatic shift of resources away from cash assistance and toward spending on other programs. In 1998, nearly 60 percent of welfare spending was on cash benefits, categorized as “basic assistance.” By 2014, it was only about one-quarter of TANF spending. That shift has happened despite a burgeoning economics literature suggesting that direct cash transfers are in many cases the most efficient tool to fight poverty.

Some of the money that used to go to cash assistance now goes to other noncash aid programs, such as child care assistance or work-related activities, and to refundable tax credits that are essentially a different form of cash transfer. But by far the biggest increase comes in what Pavetti’s group classifies as “other,” which the center says “covers a broad range of uses, including child welfare, parenting training, substance abuse treatment, domestic violence services and early education.” Those programs might be worthwhile in their own right, but they don’t have much to do with the original goals of welfare. In 2014, about one-third of TANF spending went to “other” areas, up from 12 percent in 1998.

The shift in spending varies greatly from state to state. California gives close to half of its total welfare dollars directly to low-income residents in the form of cash assistance. Georgia, by contrast, spends 80 percent of its funds on programs in the “other” category, and gives just 8 percent directly to families in cash.

The level of benefits also spans a wide spectrum. In 2012, the maximum monthly amount a single parent with two children could receive varied from $770 in New York to just $170 in Mississippi. And that’s assuming they could qualify. The maximum monthly earnings for this hypothetical individual to be eligible for TANF was as high as $1,829 in Wisconsin but as low as $268 in Alabama.

The effects of these changes are hotly disputed and difficult to measure. Welfare reform entailed much more than just creating the block-grant program. It imposed strict work requirements and set limits on how long people could receive benefits, among other changes. (Those requirements also vary by state.) A variety of other policy changes, such as the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, came around the time of welfare reform but weren’t formally part of it.

This much is clear: The various reforms resulted in fewer low-income families getting cash assistance. That was the point, after all. In 1996, 68 out of every 100 low-income families received cash assistance nationwide; but by 2014, that fell to 23 out of every 100 such families.

Advocates for welfare reform hoped that pushing families off of cash assistance would lead more of them to find work. There is evidence that happened. Between 1995 and 2000, the share of never-married mothers working rose from 49 percent to 66 percent; although since then, it has fallen, especially during the Great Recession. The extra income boost that came from work, prodded by the work requirements embedded in the law, helped lift many out of poverty.

But critics argue that the poorest Americans fared less well. According to the Census Bureau, the number of children living in deep poverty — defined as living in families with incomes less than 50 percent of the poverty line — has risen during the past 20 years. And in a new book, sociologists Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer argue that what they call “extreme” poverty — families living on $2 a day or less — has as well, and that welfare reform is to blame.

Other experts disagree. In a new report responding to Edin and Shaefer’s book, economist Scott Winship of the conservative Manhattan Institute argues that official figures understate the noncash benefits that people with low incomes often receive, such as food stamps. Overall, welfare reform led to a decline in child poverty when these benefits are incorporated, he argues. And he says that extreme poverty of the kind Edin and Shaefer documented is almost nonexistent for families with children.

“There is little evidence that welfare reform caused an increase in hardship or extreme cash poverty,” Winship wrote.
Fresh rallying calls for greater equality and support for mothers in the workplace are made in two recent books: Heading Home: Motherhood, Work, and the Failed Promise of Equality and Making Motherhood Work: How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving.

In the latter, the sociologist Caitlyn Collins casts her net wide to explore how work and family tensions are exacerbated by both a long-hours culture and what she sees as society’s dismissive attitudes towards care-giving. Stressed, exhausted and unappreciated mothers in Italy and the US share anecdotes that contrast markedly with those of their Swedish counterparts. In Sweden, more progressive social policies mean that fathers take 90 days of paternity leave and play a bigger role in childcare, bringing the nirvana of work-life balance closer to reality. This approach, Collins argues, should be more widely embraced.

No one would quibble with these sentiments or the battle cry for business to take more responsibility for its employees. Yet this is all familiar territory in a debate that could be greatly enriched by a new perspective.

Extreme loneliness or the perfect balance? How to work from home and stay healthy Read more

What about child-free workers? Are they not just as disadvantaged by regressive working policies or indeed any less immune to the trivialisation of their lifestyle choices and office double standards?

The answer is yes, and I speak from experience; one that over the years has flared up with particular force whenever I have wanted to work more flexibly. Indeed, the seemingly simple request to work from home occasionally has at times been a torturous and demeaning exercise that has revealed the widely held assumption that without kids, there’s little life to balance.

“What do you want flexible working for anyway?” asked one boss incredulously, unable to fathom my motives. The inflexion didn’t go unnoticed.

Actually, at the time, with stress-induced insomnia, any reprieve from the long-hours office culture would have been transformative for both my wellbeing and productivity. Yet even after sharing the most personal of medical information, my request was denied. I remained in situ, heart pounding and head spinning.

And this was far from an isolated incident. I’ve worked in newsrooms, for global charities, as part of a four-strong agency team and even in a failing school, yet for all the different quirks, cultures and formalities, keeping me tethered to the desk has been the common dominator.

“You’re OK manning the fort aren’t you, Caroline?” my editor would ask/tell me – not really waiting for a reply and sealing my fate to work yet another Easter week. The expectation that I would be available to attend evening and weekend events, often arising from last-minute requests, came with the matter-of-fact assumption that I had no other commitments.

The leeway given to working parents is an understandable and accepted convention, but whether this courtesy is extended to all employees too often hinges on the whim of a manager. This discrepancy ignores the many other valid reasons why workers should be cut a little slack beyond childcare. Notably, dependants come in different forms, be that a sick relative, a beloved pet or ageing parent. Then there are mental-health issues, which, being unpredictable and sometimes debilitating, pose a challenge to the rigidity of corporate life.

This sense that your concerns and wellbeing are under the radar is echoed by a broader invisibility in the cultural narrative. Yet childless workers do need to be part of the conversation. While discrepancies and inconsistencies prevail, where one person’s flexible working comes at the expense of another picking up the slack, where people’s needs are pitted against each other in a warped battle to be most deserving, we will still have divisions and toxicity that ultimately benefit no one. Indeed, if the approach to flexible working had been less selective from the outset, we might by now be further down the line in seeing the office-bound nine to five for the anachronism it undoubtedly is, and all be much closer to something far more progressive.

The occasions I have been able to work flexibly have been hugely beneficial to my mental wellbeing, giving me a psychological boost simply by having more control over my agenda and life. The opportunity to exercise at more convenient times, to be outside getting the endorphins flowing, has had a hugely positive effect on my mood in a way that being holed up in an office for eight hours with its politics and white noise did not. Furthermore, away from the perpetual soundtrack of gossip and other people’s calls, I’ve been infinitely more productive.

Professor Sharon Clarke and Dr Lynn Holdsworth of Alliance Manchester Business School find a direct correlation between flexible working and reduced occupational stress. In their 2017 report Flexibility in the Workplace: Implications of flexible work arrangements for individuals, teams and organisations, they discover that the upshot is more motivated, committed and productive staff and enhanced organisational effectiveness.

Interestingly it comes with another key recommendation; to avoid perceptions of unfairness, reduced team morale and disruption to working relationships, it must be implemented consistently.

Leaders of four states that will be hard hit by the decision were also disappointed that they failed to obtain a total of $68 billion in support and compensation they were demanding. Two of the three governors in east German states are facing difficult elections later this year and there are fears the far-right Alternative for Germany party could capitalize on the looming loss of the industry that once flourished in the regions of Brandenburg and Saxony.

A decisão do ministro Alexandre de Moraes que determinou a realização de busca e apreensão da Polícia Federal em residências de ativistas de direita ou extrema-direita nesta terça (16), com postagens atacando o Supremo Tribunal Federal, foi mais um passo na escalada de polarização do país.



Na decisão que determinou a busca, apreensão e bloqueio de redes sociais e de WhatsApp de críticos do Supremo Tribunal Federal, o ministro Alexandre de Moraes enquadrou os investigados na Lei de Segurança Nacional. As penas para os crimes variam de um a seis anos de prisão.



A operação ocorreu um dia depois do mesmo ministro Alexandre de Moraes determinar a censura à revista Crusoé, que publicou uma reportagem em que relatava que o delator Marcelo Odebrecht identificou o presidente do STF, Dias Toffoli, como o "amigo do amigo de meu pai".

Embora as duas decisões tenham ocorrido no lapso de menos de 24 horas, há diferenças fundamentais sobre o conteúdo censurado pelo Supremo.



No caso da Crusoé, trata-se de uma reportagem jornalística embasada em informação obtida pela revista, que julgou que a relação atribuída a Odebrecht, um dos pivôs da Lava Jato, era de interesse público. Não há pregação de ruptura constitucional.



Já as postagens que motivaram a censura hoje trazem desde críticas aos ministros ("ovo neles"), acusações sem provas de que o STF é "bolivariano" e "alinhado a narcotraficantes" a até a sugestão de fechamento do STF.



Foi essa pregação que levou Moraes a enquadrar os ativistas de extrema-direita na Lei de Segurança Nacional, sancionada em 1983, no final da ditadura militar.



A nota irônica do episódio é que uma dessas ativistas, Isabella Trevisani, tem tatuadas no antebraço a bandeira do Brasil e a expressão "ame-o ou deixe-o", slogan usado durante o período mais violento da ditadura militar, após o Ato Institucional nº 5, que fechou o Congresso.

If you loved the record-breaking Game of Thrones season 8 premiere, you can literally Thank “The Maker”, George Lucas. According to our sources, the Star Wars creator stepped in to help showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss craft the major themes and plot points for the final season of the smash hit show.

“At first he was only interested in working with the CG elements, dragons and such, but slowly he warmed up to the humans on set,” said our insider.

We’re told Lucas provided extensive notes and many unused Star Wars ideas to Benioff and Weiss. The news confirms a juicy rumor we’ve heard before. Namely, that Lucas is a Game of Thrones superfan, and has become very friendly with creator George R.R. Martin. In fact, the pair of legendary creators are said to be collaborating on an open-world video game by FromSoftware, developers of Dark Souls and the recently released Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

Of course, the Lucas/Martin connection goes deeper than simply two masters of fantasy excited to be working together. They’re also very keen on mentoring the next generation of creators. To that end, as a result of his frequent visits to the Game of Thrones set, for which any nude scenes are placed on hold, Lucas has become a father figure to Benioff and Weiss.

Not only has “The Maker” provided creative direction on the final season of Game of Thrones, but he’s also begun to weigh in on Benioff and Weiss’ forthcoming Star Wars trilogy, rumored to take place hundreds of years before the Skywalker saga.

FSW can’t wait to see where Benioff and Weiss take things, with a little help from the legendary imagination of Lucas.

Talk of the town: Trent Alexander-Arnold has been key to Liverpool’s success this season Lorne Campbell

The birds perch, resplendent, on the Liver Building and sunlight makes the Mersey a strip of dancing gold. Such a beautiful day. A day for not caring, for taking life lightly. But that’s not Trent Alexander-Arnold.

“Don’t let them down,” Bill Shankly always said before sending Liverpool players out to play for their public. Trent takes very seriously who he represents.

Family, city, academy; every kid on a Liverpool street, Scousers whatever their background and race: he’s conscious, with each step on the pitch, that he carries them all. We meet on this shimmering day for a conversation based around Trent reaching 50 Premier League games and he’s a revelation right up to his parting shot - that when the 2013-14 title slipped for Liverpool versus…
Social Media Not Done Banning Conservatives

Just had @GrrrGraphics account banned on Instagram #censorship "account disabled for violating our Terms" or translated "You're a threat to the Democrat narrative" 😡 #StopBias — GrrrGraphics Cartoons (@GrrrGraphics) April 16, 2019 Archive.is

Political cartoonist Ben Garrison was banned from Instagram earlier today. According to the social media platform, Garrison was banned for violating their terms of service. Social media platforms have been notorious for banning Conservative accounts in the past few years, and it shows no sign of stopping. Meanwhile, Jihadi’s are posting pictures of their 4 year olds with automatic weapons.



This isn’t a new thing. Social Media giant Facebook had to issue an apology to President Trump’s Social Media Director for banning him. Facebook’s apology went something like this: “Facebook software took away his ability to do mentions for an hour or two at most. And the spokesperson says the company apologizes.” Not much is known at this time about the ban on Ben Garrison, but we will keep you informed of any updates.

In the meantime, New Right Network issues this challenge. Find your favorite Ben Garrison cartoon and post it to Instagram. Don’t stop there though. Take the fight to Facebook and Twitter as well.

UPDATE: Ben Garrison Says “Two Faced Dem” Cartoon Deleted

Ben Garrison says Instagram first deleted his cartoon titled “Two Faced Dem.” The social media outlet informed Garrison it violated their guidelines on hate speech or symbols. The image below is apparently considered hate speech/symbols. Clearly the picture is a dig against hypocrisy and double minded Democrats. Yet Instagram somehow conflates it to hate speech, though it merely points out the incompatibility of Democrat policy.

Ben Garrison’s Instagram banned cartoon: “Two Faced Dem”

Garrison didn’t have much to say, but the cartoon itself lends a lot to the argument against censorship. The deliberate twisting of this cartoon is evidence of social media bias. This incident speaks louder than the claims of big tech gurus such as Mark Zuckerberg that there is no censorship happening. Shoot Ben Garrison a message on his new account:

The archetypal image of a baseball umpire originated in Norman Rockwell’s 1948 painting Tough Call, which depicts three signal-callers looking skyward as rain starts to fall during a game. The real-life umpires shown—Larry Goetz, Beans Reardon and Lou Jorda—had an average age of about 53, establishing the standard for what the men responsible for maintaining law and order on a major-league field should look like.

“That’s in our psyche, that the ump is this older, mature, sometimes rotund person,” said Mark T. Williams, a lecturer at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University.

Now Williams wonders if that stereotype needs to change. He and a team of graduate students recently completed a study that examined the accuracy of Major League Baseball umpires on ball/strike calls from 2008 through 2018, a data set encompassing nearly four million pitches. The results showed that when it comes to adjudicating the strike zone, younger umpires fare far better than their older counterparts.

Yet in the most important games of the season, MLB still prefers experience, with the seven umps deployed in the 2018 World Series having an average age of about 53. Crew chief honors went to Ted Barrett, a 53-year-old with 22 years of major-league service time. He ranked at the bottom of last season’s umpire standings according to Williams’s research.

“Our athletes are getting fitter, and we know they have a peak,” Williams said. “I guess our umps peak, too.”

Inspiration struck Williams while he watched Game 3 of the American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox last October. On that night, replay reviews overturned three separate incorrect calls by first-base umpire Ángel Hernández, an embarrassing set of blunders that exploded on social media and prompted MLB to issue a statement.

Hernández’s struggles made Williams curious about how Hernández earned such a coveted assignment and whether others deserved the job more. While MLB evaluates its umpires internally, it doesn’t make those grades public, creating secrecy around the best and worst performers. Those internal evaluations are among the factors that determine which umpires are assigned postseason games.

Williams focused on ball/strike calls because of the amount of data available and the intense fan interest in that realm. While managers can challenge most rulings on the field, balls and strikes remain the sole purview of the umpire stationed behind the plate.

Williams and his colleagues used information from PitchF/X and Statcast, which went online league-wide in 2015, to track how often umpires disagreed with the technology. The findings left little doubt about the aging curve: The worst 10 umpires by this measure over the 11-season sample had an average age of 56 and more than 20 years of experience. Jerry Layne, a 60-year-old with 30 years of service time, finished last, followed by Rob Drake (49) and Mike Winters (60).

Meanwhile, the best 10 umps had considerably less experience, averaging just six years on the job and about 38 years of age. Mark Wegner led the pack (47-years-old), followed by Triple-A fill-in John Libka (31) and Will Little (35). No new umpire was promoted to the MLB staff this season, though one was added last year and four the year before that. The average full-time ump has around 16 years of experience.

At first, this surprised Williams, who thought that umpires would improve with time, before peaking late in their careers. Eventually, he realized that he likely underestimated the physical and mental demands of the role.

“Why should we expect someone in his 50s or 60s to be as good as someone in his 30s and 40s?” Williams said. “It’s almost an unfair expectation.”

The Major League Baseball Umpires Association Executive Committee disputes the accuracy of the study. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, the committee said, “As professionals who are constantly evaluated under MLB’s own system, we know the study’s accuracy numbers are just plain wrong. The study is based on a misunderstanding of how these systems function and completely ignores substantial margins of error in the pitch-tracking systems.”

Major League Baseball also pushed back against Williams’s study. It released a statement staying, “In several significant ways, the findings—particularly regarding accuracy—are not in line with our comprehensive data, which, unlike the study, takes into account the margin of error of the tracking system.” It added that “the measurements of umpire performance have improved in recent years because of advances in the accuracy and consistency of pitch location data.”

Indeed, Williams’s results reflect that claim. The bad call rate decreased in every year the study encompassed, topping out at 16.4% in 2008 and dropping to 9.2% last season. Better technology has certainly played a role, proving that umpires get it right far more often than not.

But that doesn’t change the reality that younger umpires fare better than their older peers, a problem exacerbated by the fact that umpires disproportionately skew older. The 76 full-time MLB umpires this season have an average age of 49. More than half of them are 55 or older, led by 66-year-olds Gerry Davis and Joe West. Davis and West ranked sixth and second from the bottom, respectively, in bad-call rate last season, while five of the best 10 are Triple-A replacements with an average of just over 33. (Minor-league fill-ins represented about 15% of MLB umpire assignments last season.)

Jim Evans, a MLB ump from 1971 through 1999, said the findings didn’t surprise him, though he cautioned against interpreting it to mean that MLB should dismiss veteran umpires. He said that umps who worked before pitch-tracking technology developed their own strike zones and then focused on calling it consistently and fairly. It didn’t always match the rulebook strike zone, but, Evans said, “The strike zone has never been technically what’s written in the rulebook.”

Umps who learned their craft more recently advanced in part because of their performance against the technology. Evans said that sometimes leads to umpires making technically correct strike calls that, in practice, don’t hold up to scrutiny—like a curveball that nicks 1/8th of an inch of the zone before diving into a dirt.

That leads to controversy and confrontation. In 2003, Curt Schilling received a $15,000 fine when he smashed an early version of a pitch-tracking camera following a rough start, claiming the umpires told him the tech affected how they called games.

Evans stressed that while important, calling balls and strikes represents only a small part of an umpire’s overall responsibility, a point MLB echoed. In its statement, the league pointed out that, “Communication and situation-handling are essential to effective game management.”

Experienced umpires get postseason assignments not only because of their ability to make calls, but because, theoretically, they can better diffuse tense situations in emotional moments. That does—and should—matter.

An automated strike zone could solve the problem, especially as the technology continues to improve. It might lead to some weird-looking pitches getting called a strike, but players would ultimately adjust.

“It’s not that robots should replace umps,” Williams said. “It’s tech-assisted human collaboration.”

The Cycling Safety Ordinance requires the city to add permanent separated bike lanes when doing reconstruction of certain roads.

The Cambridge City Council on Monday night passed an ordinance to help expand the network of bicycle infrastructure across the city, a move that bike advocates and city officials called a “first-of-its-kind” law and one they hope will inspire surrounding communities to adopt similar measures.

The Cycling Safety Ordinance requires the city to add permanent separated bike lanes when doing reconstruction on any roads that have been previously identified in the Cambridge Bicycle Plan — a proposed network of 20 miles of protected lanes — and its five-year sidewalk and street reconstruction plan.

“This ordinance gives the bike plan teeth,” Sam Feigenbaum, a volunteer with Cambridge Bicycle Safety, a local bike advocacy group, said in a statement. “The intent of the ordinance is that when the bike plan says a street needs a protected bike lane, that street will get a protected bike lane. That’s a huge step forward for the city.”

The ordinance was a collaborative effort between City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s office, Mayor Marc McGovern’s office, and members of Cambridge Bicycle Safety. A proposal was first introduced by City Council members in January, after a year of conversations with advocates.

In an interview with the Globe before Monday’s vote, McGovern said the law would move the city in the direction “of more expeditiously installing this type of infrastructure” for cyclists.

McGovern said prior to the law, a lot of time was spent debating whether roads under construction would include new bike infrastructure. The ordinance should cut out any sort of impasse.

“People would fight about it and it would divide the community,” he said. “We have now said, ‘All right, look, we’re doing it.’ When we do it, and how we do it, will depend on specific projects — and there will be opportunities for community input — but people can expect that the city is moving in this direction.”

McGovern stressed that residents shouldn’t think that every street in Cambridge that undergoes reconstruction will get a bike lane.

“I don’t want people walking away thinking that,” he said. “But it does move us forward to completing this network that we have been talking about for many, many years.”

Joseph Barr, Cambridge’s director of traffic, parking, and transportation, said that while the city will implement the law, there could be situations “where it may not be physically possible to do what was in the bicycle plan.”

“We have been clear with the bike community about this,” he said. “But it’s something that could occur rarely, if ever.”

According to details of the ordinance, DePasquale, the city manager, can nix the addition of a bike lane based on a street’s physical features, the use of a road, or because of financial constraints, according to Cambridge Bicycle Safety.

In those circumstances, DePasquale would have to provide a written analysis of why the bike lane couldn’t be built, however.

“I have been asked about the term ‘rare circumstances’ and how it may influence the Cycling Safety Ordinance,” DePasquale said in a statement. “I take rare to mean rare in a layman’s sense of the word, and in the context of the Ordinance, it is something which is infrequent, irregular, and exceptional.”

Barr, who is unaware of any other city across the country with a similar ordinance in place, said next steps will include educating residents about what the ordinance does and doesn’t mean, and how it will be rolled out.

“This is one of those things when you first start to talk about it that can seem a little unique and scary,” Barr said. “But there was a good partnership that occurred and we were able to come to an agreement on an ordinance that the city manager and the vast majority of councilors were happy with, and that’s not necessarily something we might have expected.”

While the law passed, members of Cambridge Bicycle Safety stressed Tuesday that more work needs to be done in the meantime to ensure cyclists traveling through the city are safe.

“We’re so happy that the Cycling Safety Ordinance is now law,” the group tweeted. “But we will need to keep advocating for quick build protected bike lanes so that the network can be built in five years.”

As a result, his personal relationships suffered. “I’m on my third marriage,” he said. “My son’s 18, and I might have seen him five of those 18 years.” The realization that he had missed much of his son’s life was why Newton ultimately decided to leave the profession in 2015. “Up until then I hadn’t realized I was doing anything wrong,” he said.

Offshore platform work does pay well compared to the average hourly job. Such is a big reason why oil companies and their trade associations say the California plaintiffs in Parker Drilling vs. Newton shouldn’t be paid for their 12-hour on-call shifts. An electrician averages about $30-$35 an hour off the coast of California, Newton said, and about $18 to $26 an hour in the Gulf of Mexico. Workers also tend to save money faster than the average person because they’re not spending while they’re on the platform. They’re not driving to work, going to happy hours, or paying for their own food. And when they’re not actively working, they always have plenty to do, according to the drilling companies. “The platforms are equipped with various amenities for employees to use free of charge, including cable, internet access, and fitness and recreation facilities, allowing employees to engage cost-free in many of the same personal-time activities they enjoy on land,” the groups wrote in one legal brief.

The industry’s rosy picture of life offshore isn’t entirely accurate, however. Yes, some platforms have gyms, according to Newton, but not all of them. The Internet is also a fairly new addition to platform life, and rarely works correctly. And contrary to the picture industry paints, time spent on-call isn’t play time. When they’re not actively on the job, platform workers live with the knowledge that they could have to throw their hard hat back on at any moment—even while they’re sleeping. And they are dealing with a social dynamic that is far from equivalent to the average workers’ free time spent at home.

But even if it were a paradise on oil platforms, Newton said he still thinks workers off the coast of California should be paid for their on-call time because everyone else who works in the state is paid for it. “I give you a fair days’ work, and I’m waiting there on call, and I should be compensated for it,” he said. Newton does not sympathize with oil companies’ sob stories about their bottom lines. “They make a lot of money,” he said. “They should have a little bit to go out to the employees.”

“Why, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?”

The key point for Andrew Ellison, who’s also representing the workers in Parker Drilling vs. Newton, is fairness. “If they were on land in California, they’d be paid for this work,” he said. “Why, when you cross an arbitrary line in the water, do you cease to be paid for something you would be paid for in California?”

But for the oil industry, the key point is that arbitrary line. Because legally, anything beyond three miles off the California coastline is not California. It’s the Outer Continental Shelf. That’s governed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act—or OCSLA. And OCSLA says out there, federal law applies.

OCSLA also says, however, that the adjacent state’s laws can apply out there as well—but only if they’re “applicable and not inconsistent with” federal law. The workers say California’s wage law meets that standard; the oil industry says it doesn’t. That’s the legal question at the heart of the dispute before the Court, but the decision could also affect the future of the offshore oil industry.

If the Supreme Court were to rule in the workers’ favor, Parker Drilling (now in chapter 11 restructuring) would eventually be forced to pay its former employees for the time they worked on-call. But that wouldn’t be all it would do.

In a brief filed to the high court last year, the oil industry coalition warned of broad financial consequences to its operations if the justices found that California wage law can apply to platforms off its coastline. Any California-based offshore oil company that didn’t previously pay its workers for on-call shifts would be open to lawsuits from workers seeking backpay. That could “inflict hundreds of millions of dollars of liability” on companies. “Such a result would give employees—already generously compensated under existing arrangements—a windfall of backpay, plus interest and penalties,” they wrote.

But the industry coalition also issued another warning: to its own workers. If the Supreme Court didn’t rule in its favor, they wrote, “It is doubtful that employers could offer such generous compensation and benefit terms, if relationships are subject to state-law overtime and other requirements enacted without regard for the unique circumstances of [offshore] work.”

A ruling in Parker Drilling’s favor, on the other hand, could seal the offshore industry off from state wage claims. And depending on how broadly the Supreme Court rules, it could protect much of the industry from other state regulation, as well, whether labor, environmental, or otherwise.

Such potential is likely why the federal government intervened in the case, too. The Trump administration has been hell-bent on expanding and deregulating the offshore oil industry from its earliest days, but has faced strong opposition and roadblocks from coastal states. To solve that problem, the administration has been exploring various ways to take states out of the picture. The Los Angeles Times reported last month, for example, that Trump’s been “quietly laying the groundwork to weaken a decades-old federal law that empowers California and other states to slow and even stop offshore development in federal waters.”

In its Parker Drilling brief, the federal government urged the Supreme Court to rule against the workers, and protect “the federal government’s paramount interests on the Outer Continental Shelf.” Doing so would certainly reduce the oil industry’s liability, and thus their costs. But if the case itself shows one thing, it’s that those costs won’t ever really go away. They’ll just be absorbed by workers who, until now, have been largely invisible.
У них не было криминального прошлого, поэтому их не отправили в тюрьму. В другой ситуации им дали бы несколько часов испытательных работ, заставили написать письмо с извинениями, а сотрудник службы навещал бы их раз в месяц. Но Руэнда поручила нарушителям выполнить 12 заданий и написать эссе на три с половиной тысячи знаков о расовой ненависти. «Общество взорвалось — это понятно. Но некоторые из этих детей даже не знали, что означала свастика. Их можно было либо наказать, либо реабилитировать. Тогда я вспомнила, что научило меня, когда я была в их возрасте, что открыло мне глаза на другие культуры и религии: это было чтение», — говорит Руэнда. А потому она также составила для подростков список из 35 книг, в который вошли «Я знаю, отчего птица поет в клетке» Майи Анжелу, «Убить пересмешника» Харпер Ли, «Исход» Леона Юриса, «Двенадцать лет рабства» Соломона Нортапа, «Суровое испытание» Артура Миллера и другие произведения. Все пятеро юношей выполнили письменные задания, посетили музей Холокоста в Вашингтоне и Национальный музей американской истории. Один из подростков согласился рассказать, как на него повлияло наказание в виде чтения, и показал свое эссе:

«Я понятия не имел, насколько темны некоторые стороны человеческой истории. Я никогда не задумывался о том, что происходит, потому что часть меня действительно не хотела знать об этих ужасах. Я думал, что свастика — это только символ и больше ничего. Теперь я так не думаю. Я был неправ: это многое означало для тех, кого они затрагивали. Свастики являются напоминанием о притеснении и превосходстве белой расы среди других рас, а это не так. Люди не должны чувствовать себя менее значимыми, чем они есть, и никто не должен заставлять их чувствовать себя так. Мне особенно не по себе после написания эссе о том, как я сделал кому-то плохо. Ко всем нужно относиться одинаково, независимо от расы, религии или сексуальной ориентации. Я сделаю все возможное, чтобы никогда не быть таким невежественным снова».

Когда Руэнда прочитала сочинение подростка, она заплакала. «Это сработало, а тюремное заключение не работает. Да, некоторые дети должны быть в заключении, потому что они опасны для общества или для них самих, но чаще всего тюрьма может быть очень травмирующей. Это не является целью правосудия, когда дело касается детей», — уверена прокурор.

Facebook-owned virtual reality specialist Oculus is branching out and hiring for the development of new augmented reality glasses.

At the company’s Seattle, Washington office there are job listings for a ‘product designer - AR platform’ and a ‘product design prototyper - AR experiences’. Meanwhile at its Menlo Park, California branch, it’s hiring for a ‘head of AR/VR marketing strategy and operations'.

Each of these job listings mentions AR glasses, with the marketing role specifically stating:

“In the future, our AR glasses will merge the physical and digital worlds, blending what's real with what's possible, resulting in the next mainstream, must-have, wearable consumer technology.”

The product designer job meanwhile mentions that Oculus is recruiting to its team of designers who are “inventing the future of augmented reality and help define wearable AR experiences for Facebook”.

These aren’t the only roles Facebook is hiring in for AR. Across its various offices, the firm has vacancies related to the technology, including partnerships manager, market analytics managers, software engineering and more. These listings do not specifically mention AR glasses, however.

"Of course we're working on it"

Facebook’s head of augmented reality Ficus Kirkpatrick previously confirmed to TechCrunch that “of course we’re working” on an augmented reality headset.

“We are building hardware products,” he said back in October 2018.

“We’re going forward on this . . . We want to see those glasses come into reality, and I think we want to play our part in helping to bring them there.”

In January 2019, Business Insider reported that Facebook moved hundreds of staff from its Facebook Reality Labs research unit onto a team focused on developing a standalone AR product.

One source claimed around 400 people from the research team may have been put on the project, though Facebook representative Tera Randall said it was “a few hundred”.

Former Valve developer and Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash is heading up the AR team with Facebook VP of AR and VR Andrew Bosworth.

The report when on to claim that AR glasses have already been built into a physical prototype, with the hardware potentially being prepped for a 2022 launch.

New reality

Facebook and Oculus have previously focused on the virtual reality market with headsets such as the Oculus Rift, Go, Quest and Rift S.

But with VR’s slow growth, Facebook may see an opportunity to put its vast teams to work on AR/mixed reality headsets to compete with the likes of Microsoft’s HoloLens and Magic Leap.

It looks likely in the next couple of years that another tech giant, Apple, will also step into the space. A 2017 patent filing from the iPhone maker recently surfaced that suggested work on an AR/MR headset.

The Pocket Gamer Connects conference series is heading to Seattle on May 13th to 14th.

Opinion

New Jersey –-(Ammoland.com)-There are an estimated one million-gun owners with standard capacity magazines (10+ rounds) in the State of New Jersey, bringing an estimated number of magazines holding more than ten rounds to around ten million. Some estimates even have this number being higher.

When New Jersey passed a law making these magazines illegal in 2018, there was a debate on whether the gun owners of the state would hand in their magazines. When the law went into effect at the end of last year, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Attorney General Gurbir Grewal celebrated it as a victory against gun rights advocates.

AmmoLand news reached out to departments across the Garden State and the New Jersey State Police to see how many magazines were turned in for destruction. Local departments were quick to confirm that they did not receive any magazines turned in by the citizens of New Jersey. The State Police would not comment on the record on the number of magazines turned in by residents.

Off the record, State Police sources told AmmoLand no magazines were turned in. We filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to get the official answer from State Police officials. Our first request went unanswered, so we sent another, then another, and so on until we finally received a response from the State Police.

SGT Kristina Pados of the New Jersey State Police responded to our FOIA request. She confirmed what our sources inside the New Jersey Police told us. The gun owners of New Jersey have surrendered no magazines.

However, she did state that local departments might have them.

AmmoLand reached out to local police departments across New Jersey and have not been able to find a single magazine turned over to the authorities. It would seem like the gun owners of New Jersey have decided to ignore the law most likely because it is unenforceable.

As previously reported New Jersey residents have been openly mocking Democrat Governor Phil Murphy on message boards and Facebook groups. This revelation feeds into the narrative that the new law was just a ploy to please the Governor's anti-gun base.

According to sources inside the New Jersey law enforcement communities, they still have not received any guidance on how to enforce the magazine ban. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal's office still gives the evasive response of “not discussing law enforcement tactics” when pressed on why no guidance has been given to the State Police.

No law enforcement agency spoken to has charged anyone with having a standard capacity magazine. Short of going door to door there is no way of pro-actively enforcing the law. Law enforcement has not and are not planning on using this tactic.

When the law was going into effect, some agencies considered enforcing the ban as a secondary charge. Police would add on the charge of having an illegal magazine if a crime was committed with the magazine, but we have been unable to find anyone charged even under this circumstance.

Gov. Murphy has not commented on the failure of the new law. Last December the Governor's office referred us to the New Jersey Attorney General’s office. This time we shared the FOIA response from the State Police with them, but they did not return our request for comment at the time of publication.

The streets of Davos, Switzerland, were iced over on the night of January 25, 2018, which added a slight element of danger to the prospect of trekking to the Hotel Seehof for George Soros’ annual banquet. The aged financier has a tradition of hosting a dinner at the World Economic Forum, where he regales tycoons, ministers, and journalists with his thoughts about the state of the world. That night he began by warning in his quiet, shaking Hungarian accent about nuclear war and climate change. Then he shifted to his next idea of a global menace: Google and Facebook. “Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment,” he said. “The owners of the platform giants consider themselves the masters of the universe, but in fact they are slaves to preserving their dominant position ... Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.” Across town, a group of senior Facebook executives, including COO Sheryl Sandberg and vice president of global communications Elliot Schrage, had set up a temporary headquarters near the base of the mountain where Thomas Mann put his fictional sanatorium. The world’s biggest companies often establish receiving rooms at the world’s biggest elite confab, but this year Facebook’s pavilion wasn’t the usual scene of airy bonhomie. It was more like a bunker—one that saw a succession of tense meetings with the same tycoons, ministers, and journalists who had nodded along to Soros’ broadside. Over the previous year Facebook’s stock had gone up as usual, but its reputation was rapidly sinking toward junk bond status. The world had learned how Russian intelligence operatives used the platform to manipulate US voters. Genocidal monks in Myanmar and a despot in the Philippines had taken a liking to the platform. Mid-level employees at the company were getting both crankier and more empowered, and critics everywhere were arguing that Facebook’s tools fostered tribalism and outrage. That argument gained credence with every utterance of Donald Trump, who had arrived in Davos that morning, the outrageous tribalist skunk at the globalists’ garden party. May 2019. Subscribe to WIRED. Frank J. Guzzone CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recently pledged to spend 2018 trying to fix Facebook. But even the company’s nascent attempts to reform itself were being scrutinized as a possible declaration of war on the institutions of democracy. Earlier that month Facebook had unveiled a major change to its News Feed rankings to favor what the company called “meaningful social interactions.” News Feed is the core of Facebook—the central stream through which flow baby pictures, press reports, New Age koans, and Russian-­made memes showing Satan endorsing Hillary Clinton. The changes would favor interactions between friends, which meant, among other things, that they would disfavor stories published by media companies. The company promised, though, that the blow would be softened somewhat for local news and publications that scored high on a user-driven metric of “trustworthiness.” Davos provided a first chance for many media executives to confront Facebook’s leaders about these changes. And so, one by one, testy publishers and editors trudged down Davos Platz to Facebook’s headquarters throughout the week, ice cleats attached to their boots, seeking clarity. Facebook had become a capricious, godlike force in the lives of news organizations; it fed them about a third of their referral traffic while devouring a greater and greater share of the advertising revenue the media industry relies on. And now this. Why? Why would a company beset by fake news stick a knife into real news? And what would Facebook’s algorithm deem trustworthy? Would the media executives even get to see their own scores? Facebook didn’t have ready answers to all of these questions; certainly not ones it wanted to give. The last one in particular—about trustworthiness scores—quickly inspired a heated debate among the company’s executives at Davos and their colleagues in Menlo Park. Some leaders, including Schrage, wanted to tell publishers their scores. It was only fair. Also in agreement was Campbell Brown, the company’s chief liaison with news publishers, whose job description includes absorbing some of the impact when Facebook and the news industry crash into one another. But the engineers and product managers back at home in California said it was folly. Adam Mosseri, then head of News Feed, argued in emails that publishers would game the system if they knew their scores. Plus, they were too unsophisticated to understand the methodology, and the scores would constantly change anyway. To make matters worse, the company didn’t yet have a reliable measure of trustworthiness at hand. Heated emails flew back and forth between Switzerland and Menlo Park. Solutions were proposed and shot down. It was a classic Facebook dilemma. The company’s algorithms embraid choices so complex and interdependent that it’s hard for any human to get a handle on it all. If you explain some of what is happening, people get confused. They also tend to obsess over tiny factors in huge equations. So in this case, as in so many others over the years, Facebook chose opacity. Nothing would be revealed in Davos, and nothing would be revealed afterward. The media execs would walk away unsatisfied. Related Stories Inside the Two Years That Shook Facebook—and the World

Facebook Let Dozens of Cybercrime Groups Operate in Plain Sight

Facebook's Sloppy Data-Sharing Deals Might Be Criminal After Soros’ speech that Thursday night, those same editors and publishers headed back to their hotels, many to write, edit, or at least read all the news pouring out about the billionaire’s tirade. The words “their days are numbered” appeared in article after article. The next day, Sandberg sent an email to Schrage asking if he knew whether Soros had shorted Facebook’s stock. Far from Davos, meanwhile, Facebook’s product engineers got down to the precise, algorithmic business of implementing Zuckerberg’s vision. If you want to promote trustworthy news for billions of people, you first have to specify what is trustworthy and what is news. Facebook was having a hard time with both. To define trustworthiness, the company was testing how people responded to surveys about their impressions of different publishers. To define news, the engineers pulled a classification system left over from a previous project—one that pegged the category as stories involving “politics, crime, or tragedy.” That particular choice, which meant the algorithm would be less kind to all kinds of other news—from health and science to technology and sports—wasn’t something Facebook execs discussed with media leaders in Davos. And though it went through reviews with senior managers, not everyone at the company knew about it either. When one Facebook executive learned about it recently in a briefing with a lower-­level engineer, they say they “nearly fell on the fucking floor.” The confusing rollout of meaningful social interactions—marked by internal dissent, blistering external criticism, genuine efforts at reform, and foolish mistakes—set the stage for Facebook’s 2018. This is the story of that annus horribilis, based on interviews with 65 current and former employees. It’s ultimately a story about the biggest shifts ever to take place inside the world’s biggest social network. But it’s also about a company trapped by its own pathologies and, perversely, by the inexorable logic of its own recipe for success. Facebook’s powerful network effects have kept advertisers from fleeing, and overall user numbers remain healthy if you include people on Insta­gram, which Facebook owns. But the company’s original culture and mission kept creating a set of brutal debts that came due with regularity over the past 16 months. The company floundered, dissembled, and apologized. Even when it told the truth, people didn’t believe it. Critics appeared on all sides, demanding changes that ranged from the essential to the contradictory to the impossible. As crises multiplied and diverged, even the company’s own solutions began to cannibalize each other. And the most crucial episode in this story—the crisis that cut the deepest—began not long after Davos, when some reporters from The New York Times, The Guardian, and Britain’s Channel 4 News came calling. They’d learned some troubling things about a shady British company called Cambridge Analytica, and they had some questions. II.

It was, in some ways, an old story. Back in 2014, a young academic at Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan built a personality questionnaire app called ­thisisyourdigitallife. A few hundred thousand people signed up, giving Kogan access not only to their Facebook data but also—because of Facebook’s loose privacy policies at the time—to that of up to 87 million people in their combined friend networks. Rather than simply use all of that data for research purposes, which he had permission to do, Kogan passed the trove on to Cambridge Analytica, a strategic consulting firm that talked a big game about its ability to model and manipulate human behavior for political clients. In December 2015, The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica had used this data to help Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign, at which point Facebook demanded the data be deleted. This much Facebook knew in the early months of 2018. The company also knew—because everyone knew—that Cambridge Analytica had gone on to work with the Trump campaign after Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. And some people at Facebook worried that the story of their company’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica was not over. One former Facebook communications official remembers being warned by a manager in the summer of 2017 that unresolved elements of the Cambridge Analytica story remained a grave vulnerability. No one at Facebook, however, knew exactly when or where the unexploded ordnance would go off. “The company doesn’t know yet what it doesn’t know yet,” the manager said. (The manager now denies saying so.) The company first heard in late February that the Times and The Guardian had a story coming, but the department in charge of formulating a response was a house divided. In the fall, Facebook had hired a brilliant but fiery veteran of tech industry PR named Rachel Whetstone. She’d come over from Uber to run communications for Facebook’s WhatsApp, Insta­gram, and Messenger. Soon she was traveling with Zuckerberg for public events, joining Sandberg’s senior management meetings, and making decisions—like picking which outside public relations firms to cut or retain—that normally would have rested with those officially in charge of Facebook’s 300-person communications shop. The staff quickly sorted into fans and haters. And so it was that a confused and fractious communications team huddled with management to debate how to respond to the Times and Guardian reporters. The standard approach would have been to correct misinformation or errors and spin the company’s side of the story. Facebook ultimately chose another tack. It would front-run the press: dump a bunch of information out in public on the eve of the stories’ publication, hoping to upstage them. It’s a tactic with a short-term benefit but a long-term cost. Investigative journalists are like pit bulls. Kick them once and they’ll never trust you again. Facebook’s decision to take that risk, according to multiple people involved, was a close call. But on the night of Friday, March 16, the company announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica from its platform. This was a fateful choice. “It’s why the Times hates us,” one senior executive says. Another communications official says, “For the last year, I’ve had to talk to reporters worried that we were going to front-run them. It’s the worst. Whatever the calculus, it wasn’t worth it.” The tactic also didn’t work. The next day the story—focused on a charismatic whistle-­blower with pink hair named Christopher Wylie—exploded in Europe and the United States. Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, was claiming that the company had not deleted the data it had taken from Facebook and that it may have used that data to swing the American presidential election. The first sentence of The Guardian’s reporting blared that this was “one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches” and that Cambridge Analytica had used the data “to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.” The story was a witch’s brew of Russian operatives, privacy violations, confusing data, and Donald Trump. It touched on nearly all the fraught issues of the moment. Politicians called for regulation; users called for boycotts. In a day, Facebook lost $36 billion in its market cap. Because many of its employees were compensated based on the stock’s performance, the drop did not go unnoticed in Menlo Park. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches To this emotional story, Facebook had a programmer’s rational response. Nearly every fact in The Guardian’s opening paragraph was misleading, its leaders believed. The company hadn’t been breached—an academic had fairly downloaded data with permission and then unfairly handed it off. And the software that Cambridge Analytica built was not powerful, nor could it predict or influence choices at the ballot box. But none of that mattered. When a Facebook executive named Alex Stamos tried on Twitter to argue that the word breach was being misused, he was swatted down. He soon deleted his tweets. His position was right, but who cares? If someone points a gun at you and holds up a sign that says hand’s up, you shouldn’t worry about the apostrophe. The story was the first of many to illuminate one of the central ironies of Facebook’s struggles. The company’s algorithms helped sustain a news ecosystem that prioritizes outrage, and that news ecosystem was learning to direct outrage at Facebook. As the story spread, the company started melting down. Former employees remember scenes of chaos, with exhausted executives slipping in and out of Zuckerberg’s private conference room, known as the Aquarium, and Sandberg’s conference room, whose name, Only Good News, seemed increasingly incongruous. One employee remembers cans and snack wrappers everywhere; the door to the Aquarium would crack open and you could see people with their heads in their hands and feel the warmth from all the body heat. After saying too much before the story ran, the company said too little afterward. Senior managers begged Sandberg and Zuckerberg to publicly confront the issue. Both remained publicly silent. “We had hundreds of reporters flooding our inboxes, and we had nothing to tell them,” says a member of the communications staff at the time. “I remember walking to one of the cafeterias and overhearing other Facebookers say, ‘Why aren’t we saying anything? Why is nothing happening?’ ” According to numerous people who were involved, many factors contributed to Facebook’s baffling decision to stay mute for five days. Executives didn’t want a repeat of Zuckerberg’s ignominious performance after the 2016 election when, mostly off the cuff, he had proclaimed it “a pretty crazy idea” to think fake news had affected the result. And they continued to believe people would figure out that Cambridge Analytica’s data had been useless. According to one executive, “You can just buy all this fucking stuff, all this data, from the third-party ad networks that are tracking you all over the planet. You can get way, way, way more privacy-­violating data from all these data brokers than you could by stealing it from Facebook.” “Those five days were very, very long,” says Sandberg, who now acknowledges the delay was a mistake. The company became paralyzed, she says, because it didn’t know all the facts; it thought Cambridge Analytica had deleted the data. And it didn’t have a specific problem to fix. The loose privacy policies that allowed Kogan to collect so much data had been tightened years before. “We didn’t know how to respond in a system of imperfect information,” she says. Facebook’s other problem was that it didn’t understand the wealth of antipathy that had built up against it over the previous two years. Its prime decisionmakers had run the same playbook successfully for a decade and a half: Do what they thought was best for the platform’s growth (often at the expense of user privacy), apologize if someone complained, and keep pushing forward. Or, as the old slogan went: Move fast and break things. Now the public thought Facebook had broken Western democracy. This privacy violation—unlike the many others before it—wasn’t one that people would simply get over. Finally, on Wednesday, the company decided Zuckerberg should give a television interview. After snubbing CBS and PBS, the company summoned a CNN reporter who the communications staff trusted to be reasonably kind. The network’s camera crews were treated like potential spies, and one communications official remembers being required to monitor them even when they went to the bathroom. (Facebook now says this was not company protocol.) In the interview itself, Zuckerberg apologized. But he was also specific: There would be audits and much more restrictive rules for anyone wanting access to Facebook data. Facebook would build a tool to let users know if their data had ended up with Cambridge Analytica. And he pledged that Facebook would make sure this kind of debacle never happened again. A flurry of other interviews followed. That Wednesday, WIRED was given a quiet heads-up that we’d get to chat with Zuckerberg in the late afternoon. At about 4:45 pm, his communications chief rang to say he would be calling at 5. In that interview, Zuckerberg apologized again. But he brightened when he turned to one of the topics that, according to people close to him, truly engaged his imagination: using AI to keep humans from polluting Facebook. This was less a response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal than to the backlog of accusations, gathering since 2016, that Facebook had become a cesspool of toxic virality, but it was a problem he actually enjoyed figuring out how to solve. He didn’t think that AI could completely eliminate hate speech or nudity or spam, but it could get close. “My understanding with food safety is there’s a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as it’s going through the processing, and it’s not a large amount—it needs to be a very small amount,” he told WIRED. The interviews were just the warmup for Zuckerberg’s next gauntlet: A set of public, televised appearances in April before three congressional committees to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and months of other scandals. Congresspeople had been calling on him to testify for about a year, and he’d successfully avoided them. Now it was game time, and much of Facebook was terrified about how it would go. As it turned out, most of the lawmakers proved astonishingly uninformed, and the CEO spent most of the day ably swatting back soft pitches. Back home, some Facebook employees stood in their cubicles and cheered. When a plodding Senator Orrin Hatch asked how, exactly, Facebook made money while offering its services for free, Zuckerberg responded confidently, “Senator, we run ads,” a phrase that was soon emblazoned on T-shirts in Menlo Park. Adam Maida III.

The Saturday after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Sandberg told Molly Cutler, a top lawyer at Facebook, to create a crisis response team. Make sure we never have a delay responding to big issues like that again, Sandberg said. She put Cutler’s new desk next to hers, to guarantee Cutler would have no problem convincing division heads to work with her. “I started the role that Monday,” Cutler says. “I never made it back to my old desk. After a couple of weeks someone on the legal team messaged me and said, ‘You want us to pack up your things? It seems like you are not coming back.’ ” Then Sandberg and Zuckerberg began making a huge show of hiring humans to keep watch over the platform. Soon you couldn’t listen to a briefing or meet an executive without being told about the tens of thousands of content moderators who had joined the company. By the end of 2018, about 30,000 people were working on safety and security, which is roughly the number of newsroom employees at all the newspapers in the United States. Of those, about 15,000 are content reviewers, mostly contractors, employed at more than 20 giant review factories around the world. Facebook was also working hard to create clear rules for enforcing its basic policies, effectively writing a constitution for the 1.5 billion daily users of the platform. The instructions for moderating hate speech alone run to more than 200 pages. Moderators must undergo 80 hours of training before they can start. Among other things, they must be fluent in emoji; they study, for example, a document showing that a crown, roses, and dollar signs might mean a pimp is offering up prostitutes. About 100 people across the company meet every other Tuesday to review the policies. A similar group meets every Friday to review content policy enforcement screwups, like when, as happened in early July, the company flagged the Declaration of Independence as hate speech. The company hired all of these people in no small part because of pressure from its critics. It was also the company’s fate, however, that the same critics discovered that moderating content on Facebook can be a miserable, soul-scorching job. As Casey Newton reported in an investigation for the Verge, the average content moderator in a Facebook contractor’s outpost in Arizona makes $28,000 per year, and many of them say they have developed PTSD-like symptoms due to their work. Others have spent so much time looking through conspiracy theories that they’ve become believers themselves. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence Ultimately, Facebook knows that the job will have to be done primarily by machines—which is the company’s preference anyway. Machines can browse porn all day without flatlining, and they haven’t learned to unionize yet. And so simultaneously the company mounted a huge effort, led by CTO Mike Schroepfer, to create artificial intelligence systems that can, at scale, identify the content that Facebook wants to zap from its platform, including spam, nudes, hate speech, ISIS propaganda, and videos of children being put in washing machines. An even trickier goal was to identify the stuff that Facebook wants to demote but not eliminate—like misleading clickbait crap. Over the past several years, the core AI team at Facebook has doubled in size annually. Even a basic machine-learning system can pretty reliably identify and block pornography or images of graphic violence. Hate speech is much harder. A sentence can be hateful or prideful depending on who says it. “You not my bitch, then bitch you are done,” could be a death threat, an inspiration, or a lyric from Cardi B. Imagine trying to decode a similarly complex line in Spanish, Mandarin, or Burmese. False news is equally tricky. Facebook doesn’t want lies or bull on the platform. But it knows that truth can be a kaleidoscope. Well-meaning people get things wrong on the internet; malevolent actors sometimes get things right. Schroepfer’s job was to get Facebook’s AI up to snuff on catching even these devilishly ambiguous forms of content. With each category the tools and the success rate vary. But the basic technique is roughly the same: You need a collection of data that has been categorized, and then you need to train the machines on it. For spam and nudity these databases already exist, created by hand in more innocent days when the threats online were fake Viagra and Goatse memes, not Vladimir Putin and Nazis. In the other categories you need to construct the labeled data sets yourself—ideally without hiring an army of humans to do so. One idea Schroepfer discussed enthusiastically with WIRED involved starting off with just a few examples of content identified by humans as hate speech and then using AI to generate similar content and simultaneously label it. Like a scientist bioengineering both rodents and rat terriers, this approach would use software to both create and identify ever-more-complex slurs, insults, and racist crap. Eventually the terriers, specially trained on superpowered rats, could be set loose across all of Facebook. The company’s efforts in AI that screens content were nowhere roughly three years ago. But Facebook quickly found success in classifying spam and posts supporting terror. Now more than 99 percent of content created in those categories is identified before any human on the platform flags it. Sex, as in the rest of human life, is more complicated. The success rate for identifying nudity is 96 percent. Hate speech is even tougher: Facebook finds just 52 percent before users do. These are the kinds of problems that Facebook executives love to talk about. They involve math and logic, and the people who work at the company are some of the most logical you’ll ever meet. But Cambridge Analytica was mostly a privacy scandal. Facebook’s most visible response to it was to amp up content moderation aimed at keeping the platform safe and civil. Yet sometimes the two big values involved—privacy and civility—come into opposition. If you give people ways to keep their data completely secret, you also create secret tunnels where rats can scurry around undetected. In other words, every choice involves a trade-off, and every trade-off means some value has been spurned. And every value that you spurn—particularly when you’re Facebook in 2018—means that a hammer is going to come down on your head. IV.

Crises offer opportunities. They force you to make some changes, but they also provide cover for the changes you’ve long wanted to make. And four weeks after Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress, the company initiated the biggest reshuffle in its history. About a dozen executives shifted chairs. Most important, Chris Cox, longtime head of Facebook’s core product—known internally as the Blue App—would now oversee WhatsApp and Insta­gram too. Cox was perhaps Zuckerberg’s closest and most trusted confidant, and it seemed like succession planning. Adam Mosseri moved over to run product at Insta­gram. Insta­gram, which was founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, had been acquired by Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion. The price at the time seemed ludicrously high: That much money for a company with 13 employees? Soon the price would seem ludicrously low: A mere billion dollars for the fastest-growing social network in the world? Internally, Facebook at first watched Insta­gram’s relentless growth with pride. But, according to some, pride turned to suspicion as the pupil’s success matched and then surpassed the professor’s. Systrom’s glowing press coverage didn’t help. In 2014, according to someone directly involved, Zuckerberg ordered that no other executives should sit for magazine profiles without his or Sandberg’s approval. Some people involved remember this as a move to make it harder for rivals to find employees to poach; others remember it as a direct effort to contain Systrom. Top executives at Facebook also believed that Insta­gram’s growth was cannibalizing the Blue App. In 2017, Cox’s team showed data to senior executives suggesting that people were sharing less inside the Blue App in part because of Insta­gram. To some people, this sounded like they were simply presenting a problem to solve. Others were stunned and took it as a sign that management at Facebook cared more about the product they had birthed than one they had adopted. By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them. Most of Insta­gram—and some of Facebook too—hated the idea that the growth of the photo-sharing app could be seen, in any way, as trouble. Yes, people were using the Blue App less and Insta­gram more. But that didn’t mean Insta­gram was poaching users. Maybe people leaving the Blue App would have spent their time on Snapchat or watching Netflix or mowing their lawns. And if Insta­gram was growing quickly, maybe it was because the product was good? Insta­gram had its problems—bullying, shaming, FOMO, propaganda, corrupt micro-­influencers—but its internal architecture had helped it avoid some of the demons that haunted the industry. Posts are hard to reshare, which slows virality. External links are harder to embed, which keeps the fake-news providers away. Minimalist design also minimized problems. For years, Systrom and Krieger took pride in keeping Insta­gram free of hamburgers: icons made of three horizontal lines in the corner of a screen that open a menu. Facebook has hamburgers, and other menus, all over the place. Systrom and Krieger had also seemingly anticipated the techlash ahead of their colleagues up the road in Menlo Park. Even before Trump’s election, Insta­gram had made fighting toxic comments its top priority, and it had rolled out an AI filtering system in June 2017. By the spring of 2018, the company was working on a product to alert users that “you’re all caught up” when they’d seen all the new posts in their feed. In other words, “put your damn phone down and talk to your friends.” That may be a counterintuitive way to grow, but earning goodwill does help over the long run. And sacrificing growth for other goals wasn’t Facebook’s style at all. By the time the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit, Systrom and Krieger, according to people familiar with their thinking, were already worried that Zuckerberg was souring on them. They had been allowed to run their company reasonably independently for six years, but now Zuckerberg was exerting more control and making more requests. When conversations about the reorganization began, the Insta­gram founders pushed to bring in Mosseri. They liked him, and they viewed him as the most trustworthy member of Zuckerberg’s inner circle. He had a design background and a mathematical mind. They were losing autonomy, so they might as well get the most trusted emissary from the mothership. Or as Lyndon Johnson said about J. Edgar Hoover, “It’s probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in.” Meanwhile, the founders of WhatsApp, Brian Acton and Jan Koum, had moved outside of Facebook’s tent and commenced fire. Zuckerberg had bought the encrypted messaging platform in 2014 for $19 billion, but the cultures had never entirely meshed. The two sides couldn’t agree on how to make money—WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption wasn’t originally designed to support targeted ads—and they had other differences as well. WhatsApp insisted on having its own conference rooms, and, in the perfect metaphor for the two companies’ diverging attitudes over privacy, WhatsApp employees had special bathroom stalls designed with doors that went down to the floor, unlike the standard ones used by the rest of Facebook. Eventually the battles became too much for Acton and Koum, who had also come to believe that Facebook no longer intended to leave them alone. Acton quit and started funding a competing messaging platform called Signal. During the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he tweeted, “It is time. #deletefacebook.” Soon afterward, Koum, who held a seat on Facebook’s board, announced that he too was quitting, to play more Ultimate Frisbee and work on his collection of air-cooled Porsches. The departure of the WhatsApp founders created a brief spasm of bad press. But now Acton and Koum were gone, Mosseri was in place, and Cox was running all three messaging platforms. And that meant Facebook could truly pursue its most ambitious and important idea of 2018: bringing all those platforms together into something new. V.

By the late spring, news organizations—even as they jockeyed for scoops about the latest meltdown in Menlo Park—were starting to buckle under the pain caused by Facebook’s algorithmic changes. Back in May of 2017, according to Parse.ly, Facebook drove about 40 percent of all outside traffic to news publishers. A year later it was down to 25 percent. Publishers that weren’t in the category “politics, crime, or tragedy” were hit much harder. Jake Rowland/Esto At WIRED, the month after an image of a bruised Zuckerberg appeared on the cover, the numbers were even more stark. One day, traffic from Facebook suddenly dropped by 90 percent, and for four weeks it stayed there. After protestations, emails, and a raised eyebrow or two about the coincidence, Facebook finally got to the bottom of it. An ad run by a liquor advertiser, targeted at WIRED readers, had been mistakenly categorized as engagement bait by the platform. In response, the algorithm had let all the air out of WIRED’s tires. The publication could post whatever it wanted, but few would read it. Once the error was identified, traffic soared back. It was a reminder that journalists are just sharecroppers on Facebook’s giant farm. And sometimes conditions on the farm can change without warning. Inside Facebook, of course, it was not surprising that traffic to publishers went down after the pivot to “meaningful social interactions.” That outcome was the point. It meant people would be spending more time on posts created by their friends and family, the genuinely unique content that Facebook offers. According to multiple Facebook employees, a handful of executives considered it a small plus, too, that the news industry was feeling a little pain after all its negative coverage. The company denies this—“no one at Facebook is rooting against the news industry,” says Anne Kornblut, the company’s director of news partnerships—but, in any case, by early May the pain seemed to have become perhaps excessive. A number of stories appeared in the press about the damage done by the algorithmic changes. And so Sheryl Sandberg, who colleagues say often responds with agitation to negative news stories, sent an email on May 7 calling a meeting of her top lieutenants. That kicked off a wide-ranging conversation that ensued over the next two months. The key question was whether the company should introduce new factors into its algorithm to help serious publications. The product team working on news wanted Facebook to increase the amount of public content—things shared by news organizations, businesses, celebrities—allowed in News Feed. They also wanted the company to provide stronger boosts to publishers deemed trustworthy, and they suggested the company hire a large team of human curators to elevate the highest-quality news inside of News Feed. The company discussed setting up a new section on the app entirely for news and directed a team to quietly work on developing it; one of the team’s ambitions was to try to build a competitor to Apple News. Some of the company’s most senior execs, notably Chris Cox, agreed that Facebook needed to give serious publishers a leg up. Others pushed back, especially Joel Kaplan, a former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush who was now Facebook’s vice president of global public policy. Supporting high-quality outlets would inevitably make it look like the platform was supporting liberals, which could lead to trouble in Washington, a town run mainly by conservatives. Breitbart and the Daily Caller, Kaplan argued, deserved protections too. At the end of the climactic meeting, on July 9, Zuckerberg sided with Kaplan and announced that he was tabling the decision about adding ways to boost publishers, effectively killing the plan. To one person involved in the meeting, it seemed like a sign of shifting power. Cox had lost and Kaplan had won. Either way, Facebook’s overall traffic to news organizations continued to plummet. VI.

That same evening, Donald Trump announced that he had a new pick for the Supreme Court: Brett Kavanaugh. As the choice was announced, Joel Kaplan stood in the background at the White House, smiling. Kaplan and Kavanaugh had become friends in the Bush White House, and their families had become intertwined. They had taken part in each other’s weddings; their wives were best friends; their kids rode bikes together. No one at Facebook seemed to really notice or care, and a tweet pointing out Kaplan’s attendance was retweeted a mere 13 times. Meanwhile, the dynamics inside the communications department had gotten even worse. Elliot Schrage had announced that he was going to leave his post as VP of global communications. So the company had begun looking for his replacement; it focused on interviewing candidates from the political world, including Denis McDonough and Lisa Monaco, former senior officials in the Obama administration. But Rachel Whetstone also declared that she wanted the job. At least two other executives said they would quit if she got it. The need for leadership in communications only became more apparent on July 11, when John Hegeman, the new head of News Feed, was asked in an interview why the company didn’t ban Alex Jones’ InfoWars from the platform. The honest answer would probably have been to just admit that Facebook gives a rather wide berth to the far right because it’s so worried about being called liberal. Hegeman, though, went with the following: “We created Facebook to be a place where different people can have a voice. And different publishers have very different points of view.” This, predictably, didn’t go over well with the segments of the news media that actually try to tell the truth and that have never, as Alex Jones has done, reported that the children massacred at Sandy Hook were actors. Public fury ensued. Most of Facebook didn’t want to respond. But Whetstone decided it was worth a try. She took to the @facebook account—which one executive involved in the decision called “a big fucking marshmallow we shouldn’t ever use like this”—and started tweeting at the company’s critics. “Sorry you feel that way,” she typed to one, and explained that, instead of banning pages that peddle false information, Facebook demotes them. The tweet was very quickly ratioed, a Twitter term of art for a statement that no one likes and that receives more comments than retweets. Whetstone, as @facebook, also declared that just as many pages on the left pump out misinformation as on the right. That tweet got badly ratioed too. Five days later, Zuckerberg sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher, the influential editor of Recode. Whetstone was in charge of prep. Before Zuckerberg headed to the microphone, Whetstone supplied him with a list of rough talking points, including one that inexplicably violated the first rule of American civic discourse: Don’t invoke the Holocaust while trying to make a nuanced point. About 20 minutes into the interview, while ambling through his answer to a question about Alex Jones, Zuckerberg declared, “I’m Jewish, and there’s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down, because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” Sometimes, Zuckerberg added, he himself makes errors in public statements. The comment was absurd: People who deny that the Holocaust happened generally aren’t just slipping up in the midst of a good-faith intellectual disagreement. They’re spreading anti-Semitic hate—intentionally. Soon the company announced that it had taken a closer look at Jones’ activity on the platform and had finally chosen to ban him. His past sins, Facebook decided, had crossed into the domain of standards violations. Eventually another candidate for the top PR job was brought into the headquarters in Menlo Park: Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the UK. Perhaps in an effort to disguise himself—or perhaps because he had decided to go aggressively Silicon Valley casual—he showed up in jeans, sneakers, and an untucked shirt. His interviews must have gone better than his disguise, though, as he was hired over the luminaries from Washington. “What makes him incredibly well qualified,” said Caryn Marooney, the company’s VP of communications, “is that he helped run a country.” Adam Maida VII.

At the end of July, Facebook was scheduled to report its quarterly earnings in a call to investors. The numbers were not going to be good; Facebook’s user base had grown more slowly than ever, and revenue growth was taking a huge hit from the company’s investments in hardening the platform against abuse. But in advance of the call, the company’s leaders were nursing an additional concern: how to put Insta­gram in its place. According to someone who saw the relevant communications, Zuckerberg and his closest lieutenants were debating via email whether to say, essentially, that Insta­gram owed its spectacular growth not primarily to its founders and vision but to its relationship with Facebook. Zuckerberg wanted to include a line to this effect in his script for the call. Whetstone counseled him not to, or at least to temper it with praise for Insta­gram’s founding team. In the end, Zuckerberg’s script declared, “We believe Insta­gram has been able to use Facebook’s infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own. A big congratulations to the Insta­gram team—and to all the teams across our company that have contributed to this success.” After the call—with its payload of bad news about growth and investment—Facebook’s stock dropped by nearly 20 percent. But Zuckerberg didn’t forget about Insta­gram. A few days later he asked his head of growth, Javier Olivan, to draw up a list of all the ways Facebook supported Insta­gram: running ads for it on the Blue App; including link-backs when someone posted a photo on Insta­gram and then cross-published it in Facebook News Feed; allowing Insta­gram to access a new user’s Facebook connections in order to recommend people to follow. Once he had the list, Zuckerberg conveyed to Insta­gram’s leaders that he was pulling away the supports. Facebook had given Insta­gram servers, health insurance, and the best engineers in the world. Now Insta­gram was just being asked to give a little back—and to help seal off the vents that were allowing people to leak away from the Blue App. Systrom soon posted a memo to his entire staff explaining Zuckerberg’s decision to turn off supports for traffic to Insta­gram. He disagreed with the move, but he was committed to the changes and was telling his staff that they had to go along. The memo “was like a flame going up inside the company,” a former senior manager says. The document also enraged Facebook, which was terrified it would leak. Systrom soon departed on paternity leave. The tensions didn’t let up. In the middle of August, Facebook prototyped a location-­tracking service inside of Insta­gram, the kind of privacy intrusion that Insta­gram’s management team had long resisted. In August, a hamburger menu appeared. “It felt very personal,” says a senior Insta­gram employee who spent the month implementing the changes. It felt particularly wrong, the employee says, because Facebook is a data-driven company, and the data strongly suggested that Insta­gram’s growth was good for everyone. The Instagram founders' unhappiness with Facebook stemmed from tensions that had brewed over many years and had boiled over in the past six months. Friends of Systrom and Krieger say the strife was wearing on the founders too. According to someone who heard the conversation, Systrom openly wondered whether Zuckerberg was treating him the way Donald Trump was treating Jeff Sessions: making life miserable in hopes that he’d quit without having to be fired. Insta­gram’s managers also believed that Facebook was being miserly about their budget. In past years they had been able to almost double their number of engineers. In the summer of 2018 they were told that their growth rate would drop to less than half of that. When it was time for Systrom to return from paternity leave, the two founders decided to make the leave permanent. They made the decision quickly, but it was far from impulsive. According to someone familiar with their thinking, their unhappiness with Facebook stemmed from tensions that had brewed over many years and had boiled over in the past six months. And so, on a Monday morning, Systrom and Krieger went into Chris Cox’s office and told him the news. Systrom and Krieger then notified their team about the decision. Somehow the information reached Mike Isaac, a reporter at The New York Times, before it reached the communications teams for either Facebook or Insta­gram. The story appeared online a few hours later, as Insta­gram’s head of communications was on a flight circling above New York City. After the announcement, Systrom and Krieger decided to play nice. Soon there was a lovely photograph of the two founders smiling next to Mosseri, the obvious choice to replace them. And then they headed off into the unknown to take time off, decompress, and figure out what comes next. Systrom and Krieger told friends they both wanted to get back into coding after so many years away from it. If you need a new job, it’s good to learn how to code. VIII.

Just a few days after Systrom and Krieger quit, Joel Kaplan roared into the news. His dear friend Brett Kavanaugh was now not just a conservative appellate judge with Federalist Society views on Roe v. Wade; he had become an alleged sexual assailant, purported gang rapist, and national symbol of toxic masculinity to somewhere between 49 and 51 percent of the country. As the charges multiplied, Kaplan’s wife, Laura Cox Kaplan, became one of the most prominent women defending him: She appeared on Fox News and asked, “What does it mean for men in the future? It’s very serious and very troubling.” She also spoke at an #IStandWithBrett press conference that was live­streamed on Breitbart. On September 27, Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee after four hours of wrenching recollections by his primary accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Laura Cox Kaplan sat right behind him as the hearing descended into rage and recrimination. Joel Kaplan sat one row back, stoic and thoughtful, directly in view of the cameras broadcasting the scene to the world. Kaplan isn’t widely known outside of Facebook. But he’s not anonymous, and he wasn’t wearing a fake mustache. As Kavanaugh testified, journalists started tweeting a screenshot of the tableau. At a meeting in Menlo Park, executives passed around a phone showing one of these tweets and stared, mouths agape. None of them knew Kaplan was going to be there. The man who was supposed to smooth over Facebook’s political dramas had inserted the company right into the middle of one. Kaplan had long been friends with Sandberg; they’d even dated as undergraduates at Harvard. But despite rumors to the contrary, he had told neither her nor Zuckerberg that he would be at the hearing, much less that he would be sitting in the gallery of supporters behind the star witness. “He’s too smart to do that,” one executive who works with him says. “That way, Joel gets to go. Facebook gets to remind people that it employs Republicans. Sheryl gets to be shocked. And Mark gets to denounce it.” If that was the plan, it worked to perfection. Soon Facebook’s internal message boards were lighting up with employees mortified at what Kaplan had done. Management’s initial response was limp and lame: A communications officer told the staff that Kaplan attended the hearing as part of a planned day off in his personal capacity. That wasn’t a good move. Someone visited the human resources portal and noted that he hadn’t filed to take the day off. What Facebook Fears In some ways, the world’s largest social network is stronger than ever, with record revenue of $55.8 billion in 2018. But Facebook has also never been more threatened. Here are some dangers that could knock it down.

US Antitrust Regulation

In March, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren proposed severing Instagram and WhatsApp from Facebook, joining the growing chorus of people who want to chop the company down to size. Even US attorney general William Barr has hinted at probing tech’s “huge behemoths.” But for now, antitrust talk remains talk—much of it posted to Facebook.

Federal Privacy Crackdowns

Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission are negotiating a settlement over whether the company’s conduct, including with Cambridge Analytica, violated a 2011 consent decree regarding user privacy. According to The New York Times, federal prosecutors have also begun a criminal investigation into Facebook’s data-sharing deals with other technology companies.

European Regulators

While America debates whether to take aim at Facebook, Europe swings axes. In 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation forced Facebook to allow users to access and delete more of their data. Then this February, Germany ordered the company to stop harvesting web-browsing data without users’ consent, effectively outlawing much of the company’s ad business.

User Exodus

Although a fifth of the globe uses Facebook every day, the number of adult users in the US has largely stagnated. The decline is even more precipitous among teenagers. (Granted, many of them are switching to Instagram.) But network effects are powerful things: People swarmed to Facebook because everyone else was there; they might also swarm for the exits. The hearings were on a Thursday. A week and a day later, Facebook called an all-hands to discuss what had happened. The giant cafeteria in Facebook’s headquarters was cleared to create space for a town hall. Hundreds of chairs were arranged with three aisles to accommodate people with questions and comments. Most of them were from women who came forward to recount their own experiences of sexual assault, harassment, and abuse. Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other members of management were standing on the right side of the stage, facing the audience and the moderator. Whenever a question was asked of one of them, they would stand up and take the mic. Kaplan appeared via video conference looking, according to one viewer, like a hostage trying to smile while his captors stood just offscreen. Another participant described him as “looking like someone had just shot his dog in the face.” This participant added, “I don’t think there was a single male participant, except for Zuckerberg looking down and sad onstage and Kaplan looking dumbfounded on the screen.” Employees who watched expressed different emotions. Some felt empowered and moved by the voices of women in a company where top management is overwhelmingly male. Another said, “My eyes rolled to the back of my head” watching people make specific personnel demands of Zuckerberg, including that Kaplan undergo sensitivity training. For much of the staff, it was cathartic. Facebook was finally reckoning, in a way, with the #MeToo movement and the profound bias toward men in Silicon Valley. For others it all seemed ludicrous, narcissistic, and emblematic of the liberal, politically correct bubble that the company occupies. A guy had sat in silence to support his best friend who had been nominated to the Supreme Court; as a consequence, he needed to be publicly flogged? In the days after the hearings, Facebook organized small group discussions, led by managers, in which 10 or so people got together to discuss the issue. There were tears, grievances, emotions, debate. “It was a really bizarre confluence of a lot of issues that were popped in the zit that was the SCOTUS hearing,” one participant says. Kaplan, though, seemed to have moved on. The day after his appearance on the conference call, he hosted a party to celebrate Kavanaugh’s lifetime appointment. Some colleagues were aghast. According to one who had taken his side during the town hall, this was a step too far. That was “just spiking the football,” they said. Sandberg was more forgiving. “It’s his house,” she told WIRED. “That is a very different decision than sitting at a public hearing.” In a year during which Facebook made endless errors, Kaplan’s insertion of the company into a political maelstrom seemed like one of the clumsiest. But in retrospect, Facebook executives aren’t sure that Kaplan did lasting harm. His blunder opened up a series of useful conversations in a workplace that had long focused more on coding than inclusion. Also, according to another executive, the episode and the press that followed surely helped appease the company’s would-be regulators. It’s useful to remind the Republicans who run most of Washington that Facebook isn’t staffed entirely by snowflakes and libs. IX.

That summer and early fall weren’t kind to the team at Facebook charged with managing the company’s relationship with the news industry. At least two product managers on the team quit, telling colleagues they had done so because of the company’s cavalier attitude toward the media. In August, a jet-lagged Campbell Brown gave a presentation to publishers in Australia in which she declared that they could either work together to create new digital business models or not. If they didn’t, well, she’d be unfortunately holding hands with their dying business, like in a hospice. Her off-the-­record comments were put on the record by The Australian, a publication owned by Rupert Murdoch, a canny and persistent antagonist of Facebook. In September, however, the news team managed to convince Zuckerberg to start administering ice water to the parched executives of the news industry. That month, Tom Alison, one of the team’s leaders, circulated a document to most of Facebook’s senior managers; it began by proclaiming that, on news, “we lack clear strategy and alignment.” Then, at a meeting of the company’s leaders, Alison made a series of recommendations, including that Facebook should expand its definition of news—and its algorithmic boosts—beyond just the category of “politics, crime, or tragedy.” Stories about politics were bound to do well in the Trump era, no matter how Facebook tweaked its algorithm. But the company could tell that the changes it had introduced at the beginning of the year hadn’t had the intended effect of slowing the political venom pulsing through the platform. In fact, by giving a slight tailwind to politics, tragedy, and crime, Facebook had helped build a news ecosystem that resembled the front pages of a tempestuous tabloid. Or, for that matter, the front page of FoxNews.com. That fall, Fox was netting more engagement on Facebook than any other English-language publisher; its list of most-shared stories was a goulash of politics, crime, and tragedy. (The network’s three most-shared posts that month were an article alleging that China was burning bibles, another about a Bill Clinton rape accuser, and a third that featured Laura Cox Kaplan and #IStandWithBrett.) Politics, Crime, or Tragedy? In early 2018, Facebook’s algorithm started demoting posts shared by businesses and publishers. But because of an obscure choice by Facebook engineers, stories involving “politics, crime, or tragedy” were shielded somewhat from the blow—which had a big effect on the news ecosystem inside the social network. Source: Parse.ly That September meeting was a moment when Facebook decided to start paying indulgences to make up for some of its sins against journalism. It decided to put hundreds of millions of dollars toward supporting local news, the sector of the industry most disrupted by Silicon Valley; Brown would lead the effort, which would involve helping to find sustainable new business models for journalism. Alison proposed that the company move ahead with the plan hatched in June to create an entirely new section on the Facebook app for news. And, crucially, the company committed to developing new classifiers that would expand the definition of news beyond “politics, crime, or tragedy.” Zuckerberg didn’t sign off on everything all at once. But people left the room feeling like he had subscribed. Facebook had spent much of the year holding the media industry upside down by the feet. Now Facebook was setting it down and handing it a wad of cash. As Facebook veered from crisis to crisis, something else was starting to happen: The tools the company had built were beginning to work. The three biggest initiatives for the year had been integrating WhatsApp, Insta­gram, and the Blue App into a more seamless entity; eliminating toxic content; and refocusing News Feed on meaningful social interactions. The company was making progress on all fronts. The apps were becoming a family, partly through divorce and arranged marriage but a family nonetheless. Toxic content was indeed disappearing from the platform. In September, economists at Stanford and New York University revealed research estimating that user interactions with fake news on the platform had declined by 65 percent from their peak in December 2016 to the summer of 2018. On Twitter, meanwhile, the number had climbed. There wasn’t much time, however, for anyone to absorb the good news. Right after the Kavanaugh hearings, the company announced that, for the first time, it had been badly breached. In an Ocean’s 11–style heist, hackers had figured out an ingenious way to take control of user accounts through a quirk in a feature that makes it easier for people to play Happy Birthday videos for their friends. The breach was both serious and absurd, and it pointed to a deep problem with Facebook. By adding so many features to boost engagement, it had created vectors for intrusion. One virtue of simple products is that they are simpler to defend. X.

Given the sheer number of people who accused Facebook of breaking democracy in 2016, the company approached the November 2018 US midterm elections with trepidation. It worried that the tools of the platform made it easier for candidates to suppress votes than get them out. And it knew that Russian operatives were studying AI as closely as the engineers on Mike Schroepfer’s team. So in preparation for Brazil’s October 28 presidential election and the US midterms nine days later, the company created what it called “election war rooms”—a term despised by at least some of the actual combat veterans at the company. The rooms were partly a media prop, but still, three dozen people worked nearly around the clock inside of them to minimize false news and other integrity issues across the platform. Ultimately the elections passed with little incident, perhaps because Facebook did a good job, perhaps because a US Cyber Command operation temporarily knocked Russia’s primary troll farm offline. Facebook got a boost of good press from the effort, but the company in 2018 was like a football team that follows every hard-fought victory with a butt fumble and a 30-point loss. In mid-November, The New York Times published an impressively reported stem-winder about trouble at the company. The most damning revelation was that Facebook had hired an opposition research firm called Definers to investigate, among other things, whether George Soros was funding groups critical of the company. Definers was also directly connected to a dubious news operation whose stories were often picked up by Breitbart. After the story broke, Zuckerberg plausibly declared that he knew nothing about Definers. Sandberg, less plausibly, did the same. Numerous people inside the company were convinced that she entirely understood what Definers did, though she strongly maintains that she did not. Meanwhile, Schrage, who had announced his resignation but never actually left, decided to take the fall. He declared that the Definers project was his fault; it was his communications department that had hired the firm, he said. But several Facebook employees who spoke with WIRED believe that Schrage’s assumption of responsibility was just a way to gain favor with Sandberg. Inside Facebook, people were furious at Sandberg, believing she had asked them to dissemble on her behalf with her Definers denials. Sandberg, like everyone, is human. She’s brilliant, inspirational, and more organized than Marie Kondo. Once, on a cross-country plane ride back from a conference, a former Facebook executive watched her quietly spend five hours sending thank-you notes to everyone she’d met at the event—while everyone else was chatting and drinking. But Sandberg also has a temper, an ego, and a detailed memory for subordinates she thinks have made mistakes. For years, no one had a negative word to say about her. She was a highly successful feminist icon, the best-selling author of Lean In, running operations at one of the most powerful companies in the world. And she had done so under immense personal strain since her husband died in 2015. But resentment had been building for years, and after the Definers mess the dam collapsed. She was pummeled in the Times, in The Washington Post, on Breit­bart, and in WIRED. Former employees who had refrained from criticizing her in interviews conducted with WIRED in 2017 relayed anecdotes about her intimidation tactics and penchant for retribution in 2018. She was slammed after a speech in Munich. She even got dinged by Michelle Obama, who told a sold-out crowd at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 1, “It’s not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn’t work all the time.” Everywhere, in fact, it was becoming harder to be a Facebook employee. Attrition increased from 2017, though Facebook says it was still below the industry norm, and people stopped broadcasting their place of employment. The company’s head of cybersecurity policy was swatted in his Palo Alto home. “When I joined Facebook in 2016, my mom was so proud of me, and I could walk around with my Facebook backpack all over the world and people would stop and say, ‘It’s so cool that you worked for Facebook.’ That’s not the case anymore,” a former product manager says. “It made it hard to go home for Thanksgiving.” XI.

By the holidays in 2018, Facebook was beginning to seem like Monty Python’s Black Knight: hacked down to a torso hopping on one leg but still filled with confidence. The Alex Jones, Holocaust, Kaplan, hack, and Definers scandals had all happened in four months. The heads of WhatsApp and Insta­gram had quit. The stock price was at its lowest level in nearly two years. In the middle of that, Facebook chose to launch a video chat service called Portal. Reviewers thought it was great, except for the fact that Facebook had designed it, which made them fear it was essentially a spycam for people’s houses. Even internal tests at Facebook had shown that people responded to a description of the product better when they didn’t know who had made it. Two weeks later, the Black Knight lost his other leg. A British member of parliament named Damian Collins had obtained hundreds of pages of internal Facebook emails from 2012 through 2015. Ironically, his committee had gotten them from a sleazy company that helped people search for photos of Facebook users in bikinis. But one of Facebook’s superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic, no matter how absurd, into a media hero. And so, without much warning, Collins released them to the world. One of Facebook’s superpowers in 2018 was the ability to turn any critic, no matter how absurd, into a media hero. The emails, many of them between Zuckerberg and top executives, lent a brutally concrete validation to the idea that Facebook promoted growth at the expense of almost any other value. In one message from 2015, an employee acknowledged that collecting the call logs of Android users is a “pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective.” He said he could imagine the news stories about Facebook invading people’s private lives “in ever more terrifying ways.” But, he added, “it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it.” (It did.) Perhaps the most telling email is a message from a then executive named Sam Lessin to Zuckerberg that epitomizes Facebook’s penchant for self-justification. The company, Lessin wrote, could be ruthless and committed to social good at the same time, because they are essentially the same thing: “Our mission is to make the world more open and connected and the only way we can do that is with the best people and the best infrastructure, which requires that we make a lot of money / be very profitable.” The message also highlighted another of the company’s original sins: its assertion that if you just give people better tools for sharing, the world will be a better place. That’s just false. Sometimes Facebook makes the world more open and connected; sometimes it makes it more closed and disaffected. Despots and demagogues have proven to be just as adept at using Facebook as democrats and dreamers. Like the communications innovations before it—the printing press, the telephone, the internet itself—Facebook is a revolutionary tool. But human nature has stayed the same. XII.

Perhaps the oddest single day in Facebook’s recent history came on January 30, 2019. A story had just appeared on TechCrunch reporting yet another apparent sin against privacy: For two years, Facebook had been conducting market research with an app that paid you in return for sucking private data from your phone. Facebook could read your social media posts, your emoji sexts, and your browser history. Your soul, or at least whatever part of it you put into your phone, was worth up to $20 a month. Other big tech companies do research of this sort as well. But the program sounded creepy, particularly with the revelation that people as young as 13 could join with a parent’s permission. Worse, Facebook seemed to have deployed the app while wearing a ski mask and gloves to hide its fingerprints. Apple had banned such research apps from its main App Store, but Facebook had fashioned a workaround: Apple allows companies to develop their own in-house iPhone apps for use solely by employees—for booking conference rooms, testing beta versions of products, and the like. Facebook used one of these internal apps to disseminate its market research tool to the public. Apple cares a lot about privacy, and it cares that you know it cares about privacy. It also likes to ensure that people honor its rules. So shortly after the story was published, Apple responded by shutting down all of Facebook’s in-house iPhone apps. By the middle of that Wednesday afternoon, parts of Facebook’s campus stopped functioning. Applications that enabled employees to book meetings, see cafeteria menus, and catch the right shuttle bus flickered out. Employees around the world suddenly couldn’t communicate via messenger with each other on their phones. The mood internally shifted between outraged and amused—with employees joking that they had missed their meetings because of Tim Cook. Facebook’s cavalier approach to privacy had now poltergeisted itself on the company’s own lunch menus. But then something else happened. A few hours after Facebook’s engineers wandered back from their mystery meals, Facebook held an earnings call. Profits, after a months-long slump, had hit a new record. The number of daily users in Canada and the US, after stagnating for three quarters, had risen slightly. The stock surged, and suddenly all seemed well in the world. Inside a conference room called Relativity, Zuckerberg smiled and told research analysts about all the company’s success. At the same table sat Caryn Marooney, the company’s head of communications. “It felt like the old Mark,” she said. “This sense of ‘We’re going to fix a lot of things and build a lot of things.’ ” Employees couldn’t get their shuttle bus schedules, but within 24 hours the company was worth about $50 billion more than it had been worth the day before. SIGN UP TODAY Sign up for the Backchannel newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED. Less than a week after the boffo earnings call, the company gathered for another all-hands. The heads of security and ads spoke about their work and the pride they take in it. Nick Clegg told everyone that they had to start seeing themselves the way the world sees them, not the way they would like to be perceived. It seemed to observers as though management actually had its act together after a long time of looking like a man in lead boots trying to cross a lightly frozen lake. “It was a combination of realistic and optimistic that we hadn’t gotten right in two years,” one executive says. Soon it was back to bedlam, though. Shortly after the all-hands, a parliamentary committee in the UK published a report calling the company a bunch of “digital gangsters.” A German regulatory authority cracked down on a significant portion of the company’s ad business. And news broke that the FTC in Washington was negotiating with the company and reportedly considering a multibillion-­dollar fine due in part to Cambridge Analytica. Later, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren published a proposal to break Facebook apart. She promoted her idea with ads on Facebook, using a modified version of the company’s logo—an act specifically banned by Facebook’s terms of service. Naturally, the company spotted the violation and took the ads down. Warren quickly denounced the move as censorship, even as Facebook restored the ads. It was the perfect Facebook moment for a new year. By enforcing its own rules, the company had created an outrage cycle about Facebook—inside of a larger outrage cycle about Facebook. XIII.

‘They’re Trying To Kill Us In Here’

At Virginia’s Hampton Roads Regional Jail, reform has been slow even after high-profile tragedies including the death of mentally disabled man incarcerated who allegedly stole $5 worth of snacks.

Prosecutors wanted to know what happened to Jamycheal Mitchell, a 24-year-old man who died in his cell at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Virginia, on August 19, 2015, just months after he was arrested on charges of trespass and petit larceny for allegedly stealing about $5 worth of snacks from a 7-Eleven.

So, on May 24, 2017, prosecutors from the Portsmouth commonwealth’s attorney’s office attempted to empanel a special grand jury to investigate the jail’s treatment of Mitchell, who had a documented history of severe mental disability including a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. But just days later, a judge denied their grand jury request. Prosecutors then spent nearly two years interviewing employees of NaphCare Inc., the company that provided medical services for the jail, which houses approximately 1,100 people per day from cities including Portsmouth, Newport News, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Hampton. Prosecutors, however, were able to speak with only 14 of the 22 NaphCare employees they sought to interview.

On Feb. 20, Portsmouth prosecutors released a 166-page report on Mitchell’s death, concluding that he had been subjected to abuse, “substandard conditions,” and inadequate care from jail staff. Prosecutors wrote that Mitchell’s family examined his signatures on certain NaphCare medical records and believed that they were forgeries, although prosecutors never proved that allegation. (NaphCare did not respond to requests for comment from The Appeal.)

“If one [Hampton Roads] officer had enough compassion for Jamycheal Mitchell to take up his cause, demand that he be properly treated for his clear bouts of mania, psychosis, and refusals of medication, to generate the appropriate emergency reports documenting their requests, and to not rest until Mr. Mitchell was stabilized and his decompensation was reversed, this report would be unnecessary,” prosecutors wrote.

In the end, however, prosecutors acknowledged that they were “still missing a great deal of information” from the jail and could only cite “relevant case law on the potential crimes that could be charged” in the Mitchell case. “Our investigative process was marred by obstacles and delays because we were forced to deal with the medical services provider on their own time, without subpoena power,” Portsmouth Commonwealth’s Attorney Stephanie N. Morales wrote in a Feb. 20 open letter to Virginia lawmakers.

DOJ blasts restrictive housing

When Mitchell was booked at Hampton Roads on May 11, 2015, after being arrested for allegedly stealing a 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew, a king size Snickers bar and a Zebra Cake from a Portsmouth 7-Eleven, he could speak intelligibly, one person incarcerated at the jail later told investigators with the Portsmouth commonwealth attorney’s office. But during the months that Mitchell was housed at the jail, this person said, his speech devolved into “gibberish.” On May 21, 2015, the Portsmouth General District Court found that Mitchell was not competent to stand trial or assist in his own defense. The court ordered him to receive treatment from Eastern State Hospital, either at the jail or the hospital itself. But that didn’t happen.

While incarcerated at the jail, correctional officers allegedly struck Mitchell on the knuckles with a flashlight, hurled profanities, mocked him, and called him “dirty,” all as punishment for being uncooperative. When Mitchell was found dead in his cell in August 2015, he was covered in urine. Portsmouth’s chief medical examiner said the cause of death was a “probable cardiac arrhythmia accompanying wasting syndrome of unknown etiology.” Mitchell’s death received extensive national media coverage, and his family settled lawsuits against the jail and NaphCare for approximately $3 million.

He was one of 68 in-custody deaths at Hampton Roads between 2003 and 2018. In 2016, the growing body count sparked a Department of Justice investigation into conditions at the jail. In December 2018, the agency released a scathing report on Hampton Roads, blasting its use of restrictive housing for the severely ill as well as the prevalence of people, like Mitchell, who were incarcerated for minor offenses.

Hampton Roads jail superintendent David Hackworth told The Appeal that increases in staffing and medical personnel began in 2016. When the DOJ visited during its investigation, he said, there were roughly 50 people from its medical services provider working in the jail. Now, there are more than 62, Hackworth said.

“The change was happening before I got here [and] changes continue to happen,” Hackworth, who became superintendent in March 2018, said during a recent phone interview. “I’ve increased the number of RNs that we have on site. I’ve increased the number of mental health professionals that we’ll have.”

But in its report, the DOJ cited the jail’s overuse of restrictive housing for severely ill people, meaning that people in poor mental or physical health were confined to their cells for most of the day. Approximately 25 percent of Hampton Roads’s 774 cells were designated as restrictive housing cells, according to the DOJ. “The jail’s practice of subjecting prisoners with serious mental illness to prolonged periods of restrictive housing under conditions, including the denial of access to adequate medical and mental health care, that places these prisoners at substantial risk of serious harm shows deliberate indifference to their health and safety,” the report stated.

On April 1, 2015, a 54-year-old who had a history of major depression identified by the DOJ only as “P.P.,” complained that he was being threatened by other people incarcerated at Hampton Roads and that he had a mental health issue not being addressed by staff. A supervisor agreed to refer P.P. to a mental health professional, but she also wrote him up for having contraband in his cell, for which he was placed in restrictive housing. On April 3, P.P. was found hanging in his cell. “Despite a history of serious mental illness, he did not see a psychiatrist during the nearly two months between his admission and his suicide,” according to the DOJ. “The only evaluation he received was by a social worker on the morning of his death.”

The DOJ also criticized the incarceration of 62 people with severe mental illness at Hampton Roads who had booking histories of “minor offenses,” such as shoplifting, trespassing, and violating their probation. During Virginia’s 2017 fiscal year, this group of people collectively spent 8,030 days at the jail and cost the local communities at least $505,890, according to the DOJ.

Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College in New York and the author of “The End of Policing,” said this population should never have been in the jail in the first place.“The ultimate solution is to quit using these facilities to manage the problems of poverty, such as mass homelessness, untreated mental illness, substance abuse and involvement in black markets, all of which are responsible for the vast majority of current jail populations,” he said.

Hackworth told The Appeal that mental health status is not a factor in the decision making process to put a person in restrictive housing. He also said there are fewer people in restrictive housing than were before he became superintendent. “I don’t put anybody in any type of restrictive housing because they’re mentally ill,” Hackworth said. “It would be based on the circumstances of what’s going on. I mean, if I’ve got somebody who is suicidal, of course we’re going to pull them out and we’re going to do appropriate suicide protocol. If I’ve got somebody who has a disciplinary issue, it’s going to be because of a disciplinary issue.”

In its December 2018 report, the DOJ gave the jail just over a month and a half to implement its recommendations. The agency also said it would sue if the jail did not “satisfactorily” improve its conditions during that time period. But when the deadline passed in February, the federal government had just emerged from the longest shutdown in history. As of early this month, the DOJ had not followed through on its threat to sue Hampton Roads. (The agency did not respond to The Appeal’s request for comment.) The jail continues to work with the DOJ on its recommendations, Hackworth said. He told The Appeal that he is awaiting more clarity from the agency on its more than 40 recommended remediations, such as auditing of administrative records regularly for completeness and accuracy, ensuring there are improved intake screenings and health assessments, and ending restrictive housing for people who say they are suicidal.

Changes not apparent to advocates

But after a coalition of advocates including the Virginia ACLU, the Portsmouth chapter of the NAACP and the Virginia branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) toured Hampton Roads on March 21, they told The Appeal that the DOJ’s recommendations did not appear to have been implemented. The inside of the jail was “dismal,” one advocate said. As they toured the locked-down restricted housing pod, some people yelled from their cells, “They’re trying to kill us in here!”

Coalition representatives said they were shocked and disappointed at the lack of a detailed plan in their discussions about mental health with jail staff.

“You don’t need to wait for the Department of Justice to tell you what good quality care and respecting people’s human rights looks like,” Rhonda Thissen, executive director of NAMI Virginia, said in a phone interview. “The staff that we met with didn’t really have a good handle on the details—how inmates were being treated, what kind of services were available.”

James Boyd, president of the NAACP in Portsmouth, said in a recent phone interview that the March visit convinced him that a court-ordered federal monitor was needed to ensure that Hampton Roads achieved real reforms.

“Jamycheal Mitchell is probably the worst civil rights injustice of our time,” he said. “There’s people in Guantánamo Bay, they get treated better than in the regional jail.”

Sheriff stops sending prisoners

In-custody deaths continue to occur at Hampton Roads. On Dec. 31, 2018, an officer found Jakub Michael Plucinski, 33, unresponsive in his cell. In late February, Victor Rhea Fountain, 62, died at the jail after he was reported to be in “medical distress.”

Because of the jail’s persistent issues with conditions of confinement, Portsmouth Sheriff Michael Moore stopped transferring arrestees there. Before the DOJ’s 2018 report, Moore told The Appeal, he was sending 15 to 20 people to Hampton Roads per month. “We haven’t sent anyone to the regional jail this year,” Moore said in a recent phone interview. “It’s not that we don’t have confidence in the new leadership there. It’s just that it makes sense from our standpoint, until those issues can be addressed and we can see some improvement moving forward, we’re just not in a position to send an inmate to that facility.”

“I just still have that conscience, that I just can’t send people to an institution that I don’t feel comfortable with. So I have to treat them just like they’re a family member,” Moore added. “I wouldn’t want a family member in those certain types of conditions. All of these people belong to someone.”
Les architectes et les historiens de l'art dénoncent un manque cruel d'entretien dans les bâtiments du patrimoine français.

Après l'incendie de la cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris, lundi 15 avril,qui a presque entièrement détruit la toiture de l'édifice, les architectes et les historiens de l'art font part de leur colère froide face au manque d'entretien de ces bâtiments. Didier Rykner, le rédacteur en chef du magazine la Tribune de l'art, et Alexandre Gady, historien de l'art, étaient les invités de franceinfo, mardi.

>> Incendie à Notre-Dame de Paris : suivez notre direct

Parce que les normes de sécurité sont insuffisantes

"On aurait pu éviter ça" s'indigne Didier Rykner, le rédacteur en chef du magazine la Tribune de l'art, mardi sur franceinfo. Selon lui, les normes de sécurité sur les chantiers de rénovation des monuments historiques sont notoirement insuffisantes. "C'est l'incendie de trop ! (...) Il y a déjà eu une série d'incendies de ce type. Les prescriptions pour les travaux sur monuments historiques étaient insuffisantes. J'avais demandé une loi et on n'a rien fait. Si la piste se précise, il va falloir que les responsables soient désignés. Un architecte du patrimoine m'a dit qu'on aurait pu éviter ça avec certaines mesures" explique le journaliste.

La flèche de Notre-Dame était en cours de rénovation. Sur ce type de chantier de rénovation, il existe des "points chauds", explique Didier Rykner. "On fait du soudage, on fait des travaux et c'est une fois que les ouvriers sont partis que le feu peut prendre. Il y a des moyens de détection immédiate qui permettent d'agir très vite. Manifestement, le feu s'est propagé très vite et d'une manière anormale. Il y a un problème. J'ai étudié cela et la plupart des spécialistes disent que ce qu'il s'est passé n'est pas normal".

"Le ministère de la Culture a fait de très gros investissements sur la sécurité incendie il y a quelques années", complète André Finot, le porte-parole de Notre-Dame. Des détecteurs avaient été installés "un peu partout", en même temps qu'un PC de sécurité incendie "avec du personnel 24h/24 pour éviter tout départ de feu." Cela a permis d'évacuer le bâtiment en "deux, trois minutes" mais pas de maîtriser l'incendie.

>> Incendie de Notre-Dame : pourquoi l'intervention des pompiers a été particulièrement complexe

"On ne va pas reconstruire Notre-Dame, on va la réparer. Mais on l'a perdue", déplore Alexandre Gady, historien de l'art, qui fait part "d'une forme de colère froide. On se dit qu'un tel édifice, dans une ville comme Paris, dans un pays qui est la sixième puissance mondiale, ça a un côté profondément dérisoire d'assister impuissant à ce qu'il s'est passé."

Parce que les monuments sont délaissés

"Nous disons depuis des années que le budget des monuments historiques est trop faible, qu'on en fait une variable d'ajustement mais à un moment, ça devient des problèmes de sécurité graves", pointe Alexandre Gady.

Didier Rykner alerte lui aussi sur l'état des autres églises parisiennes. "J'ai visité il y a quelques temps l'église de la Madeleine. J'ai pris des photos de prises électriques dans tous les sens... ce n'est absolument pas aux normes. Demain la Madeleine peut flamber. Il faudrait que madame Hidalgo se rende compte que les églises de Paris sont dans un état désastreux." Didier Rykner demande un plan d'action de grande ampleur pour sauver les monuments de la capitale.

Pour Didier Rykner, "on va dépenser des milliards d'euros pour les Jeux Olympiques en 2024 qui vont nous ruiner et avant cet incendie, on n’avait pas l’argent pour entretenir la cathédrale ? Je ne cache pas une certaine colère, qui est aussi celle de beaucoup d'historiens d'art et beaucoup de conservateurs."

Parce que la politique du patrimoine est inadaptée

"On s'aperçoit tout à coup que le patrimoine, c'est formidable, et on va mettre beaucoup d'argent... Mais il aurait peut-être fallu s'en apercevoir avant !" déplore Didier Rykner. Même son de cloche pour Alexandre Gady, qui fait part de son "immense tristesse". "L'état du patrimoine n'est pas du tout à la hauteur du niveau d'un grand pays. On a rogné sur les budgets, cherché des pis-aller, jusqu'au dernier, le loto du patrimoine. Tout ça est bien sympathique mais le patrimoine, c'est une charge régalienne, c'est l'image de la France, c'est notre histoire ! A force de faire des petits bouts de trucs à droite et à gauche, on finit par le mettre en danger."

Tous les travaux qu'on ne fait pas, qu'on repousse... On attend, on fait autre chose, on fait du festif, on s'amuse, et puis un jour la facture arrive. Pour Notre-Dame, ça va coûter des dizaines de millions d'euros pour un accident qui aurait pu être évité tout simplement avec un tout petit peu plus de protocole de sécurité.Alexandre Gadyà franceinfo

"Je ne cache pas une certaine colère (...) L'État doit prendre sa responsabilité" poursuit Didier Rykner. Selon lui, en annonçant le lancement d'une "collecte nationale" pour la reconstruction de Notre-Dame, Emmanuel Macron n'a pas eu la bonne réaction. "La bonne réaction aurait été de dire que l’État reconstruira. C’est l'État qui est propriétaire de la cathédrale de Paris. Il faut effectivement lancer des souscriptions, mais que l'État prenne enfin en charge le patrimoine dans ce pays. L'État a l'argent".

Didier Rykner salue le geste de la famille Pinault qui va donner 100 millions d'euros pour la reconstruction de Notre-Dame. "Et même pour la famille Pinault ce n'est pas rien, 100 millions d'euros. Cela fait 1/350e de sa fortune, ce n'est pas rien."
Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano said he thinks that he can overcome his age, his reputation and a long major league absence to make it back to the big leagues.

''Why not?'' Zambrano said Monday from Marlins Park, where the Cubs are playing this week. ''Bartolo [Colon] pitched until he was 45. I'm 37.''

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Zambrano showed off an email from the independent Chicago Dogs that welcomed him to this season's team. The Dogs play in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, and their season starts May 17.

Carlos Zambrano says he had "an encounter with God" that brought him back to baseball. https://t.co/7fyx3FigAz — Chicago Sun-Times (@Suntimes) April 16, 2019

Zambrano hasn't pitched in the big leagues since 2012. From 2003 to '08, however, he won double-digit games each season, leading the league with 16 in 2006. He has a career 3.66 ERA with 1,637 strikeouts.

But he also got into a fistfight in the dugout with catcher Michael Barrett in 2007. In 2009, he got into a heated argument with an umpire and beat up a Gatorade dispenser, earning a six-game suspension.

These weren't his only outbursts, but in 2011 he had his last with the Cubs. After giving up five home runs in an August start in Atlanta, Zambrano erupted and was ejected. He cleaned out his locker and left the stadium, reportedly telling teammates he was retiring. The Cubs suspended Zambrano, and he never pitched for the team again. One of new president Theo Epstein's first acts was to trade him to Miami.

Zambrano now credits God for changing him. The pivotal event happened at a Christian youth conference in his native Venezuela.

''I went to that conference, and something happened to me and changed my life,'' he said, according to the newspaper. ''I had an encounter with God. I used to believe in God. And now I'm committed.''

Zambrano played in the Mexican League last year, and his fastball topped out at 89 mph. In winter league, he said he hit 94.

''I want to see if I can throw 95 again,'' Zambrano said.

In his prime, Zambrano had some of the best stuff of a group of Cubs pitchers that included Kerry Wood and Mark Prior, but he could not control his emotions. He feels that his stuff can translate to a relief role in the majors and that he has a new emotional perspective.

''What happened with me was for a purpose," he said, according to the Sun-Times. "God can convert the most evil guy into the most dedicated man in a ministry. I'm not saying I'm perfect now. I think I can handle myself.''
There's no doubt in our mind that the fire which swept through Paris’ famed historic cathedral, Notre Dame on April 16 was undoubtedly devastating. Sure, it's not a tragedy where lives are lost or destroyed, but to anyone who watched the video of the cathedral's spire falling, there's definitely a sense of loss over a piece of iconic history.

There's a silver lining, of course. If you consider the fact that this event signified that Notre Dame was a fire hazard, then maybe it really was time for it to be rebuilt. Notre Dame was already in the midst of renovation, which means a lot of artifacts such as the historic statues are safe as they were already removed. The Holy Crown of Thorns, and a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French King Louis- two irreplaceable artifacts - had been rescued as well.
district0x Dev Update - April 16th, 2019

Development progress and product changes from district0x

Alexander Khoriaty Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 16

The most recent development cycle from our service providers at district0x yielded several important enhancements across our open projects. Meme Factory received crucial administrative upgrades to the DANK faucet, as well as improvements to several navigation features and many content filter upgrades. Meanwhile, the District Registry continues to be hammered into shape, with several more pages and features being designed and worked into the app. Similarly, Ethlance previously received several pages of work from our designers, and since we’ve been building out the front-end components needed to house these designs.

Meme Factory

At this point, Meme Factory has had all of it’s basic functionality thoroughly battletested on Ropsten testnet. However, several aspects of our original implementation were ripe for deeper updates. Primary among these is the infinite scrolling feature to Meme Factory. Our previous implementation was inconsistent at best, and often slow to perform it’s duties when a user scrolls to the bottom of the page. We proceeded with several infrastructure updates to improve the speed of content polling, and refactored the pieces needed to smooth out the infinite scroll feature. Along with our ongoing work on the guided website tutorial, this has unfortunately introduced a few regressions, some of which we’re continuing to work through currently.

In addition to infinite scrolling, we’ve also been making smaller enhancements to grouping and filtering systems across the marketplace. We’ve added several radio buttons to group memes by different parameters — including the order of issuance and the cheapest memes on offer. We’ve also made several devops improvements to the re-syncing process on our test server, allowing us to reboot and resync quickly from cache instead of a complete sync from nothing. We’ve also introduced several redundancies to our IPFS services to prevent any unexpected loss of pinned content. This has come hand in hand with some optimizations to improve fetch times by minimizing image sizes.

Lastly, work with the DANK faucet has been proceeding accordingly, with several upgraded administrative features now in place. These include things like an auto-check against double claims, whereby we can verify a phone number as unique and unused before calling out to the contract to check. This will prevent all kind of unnecessary waste through gas and transaction fees. We’ve also added a variety of functions to allow us to reset the DANK distribution to particular users, as well as up the total allocation amount for all users (in case we ever want to re-distribute DANK to participants in the future). On the whole, we have gone from having a simple straightforward faucet that spits out DANK when you give it a number to a more complete tool for managing alll manner of DANK distribution post-launch.

District Registry

The District Registry remains in a very similar development state as the previous update. With the arrival of a new batch of design work, we were able to start constructing the final versions of each registry webpage, and identify any blind spots or missing buttons/feature we would have missed earlier in the development cycle. With each passing week, as more of the larger issues are resolved, the smaller ones appear, requiring additional design work. These include very minor elements (like a custom made 404 page, and additional fancy loading spinners) that will ultimately lend to a much fuller and unique experience. Efforts will continue in this manner until we can no longer see any room for improvement, at which point we will return to the requirements for completing our Aragon integration.

Ethlance

Ethlance, like the District Registry, is at the point of receiving most of its design assets and hammering out any unexpected or missing assets for further development. As mentioned in prior development updates, Ethlance is sharing development resources with service providers also contributing towards Meme Factory, and as such has had little visible progress in the past two weeks in favor of further polishing of front end components for Meme Factory. However, with these aspects to Meme Factory’s development nailed down, efforts and resume towards restyling Ethlance components in accordance with the process we’ve used for the District Registry.

In the coming weeks, the team will be working to migrate Meme Factory to a real production server environment, as well as testing ghost contracts on the actual Ethereum mainnet to confirm nothing has changed from our QA instance to a live public one. It’s been a very long journey for Meme Factory, but we’re excited to get our latest application into the hands of the users, and to apply the hard lessons we’ve learned from this development journey towards future projects.

ASHEVILLE — What police described in arrest warrants as a months-long graffiti tour of downtown and the South Slope ended for a local man late last month.

Leonardo Nunes Borgneth, 39, was arrested March 28 and charged with several counts of misdemeanor larceny and breaking into coin machine charges. On April 12, police added 15 counts of graffiti vandalism to the charges against Borgneth.

Between November and March, police say that Borgneth tagged 14 Asheville businesses grouped along Lexington and Biltmore avenues and in the South Slope.

Along the brick wall that forms one side of Lexington's Chevron Trading Post and Bead Co. Borgneth used black spray paint to write "relax, space and Egypt," according to arrest warrants, which date the graffiti to early March. That wall, a seafoam color before, now bears a slightly darker patch of paint used to cover the graffiti.

According to Borgneth's warrants, space and Egypt were a common theme in his tags across town. On the doors to Twin Leaf Brewery in the South Slope, police say, Borgneth used a white paint pen to write "Egypt and space." That happened in late February, warrants state.

About a month earlier, a van belonging to Swannanoa Cleaners, a staple of Coxe Avenue located just down the road from Twin Leaf, got a fresh coat of unwanted paint. "Relax, space and your mother's idol" had been sprayed in black across the side of the white vehicle, according to warrants.

Police allege that Borgneth also tagged TakoSushi, Food Lion Skate Park, Manicomio Pizza, Bender Gallery, and Patton Avenue Pet Company among other businesses.

Each graffiti count came with a $500 secured bond, totaling $7,500. That's in addition to the $17,000 secured bond Borgneth was already being held in lieu of at the Buncombe County jail.

He is next expected in court on May 9.

Last year, Joseph Ferraiola wrote that “we’re thinking about quarterback ceilings all wrong,” poking holes in the conventional draft wisdom on QB projections. He re-examines this theory by looking at 2018 rookies Josh Rosen and Josh Allen and applies this lens to the 2019 class’ top signal-callers, Kyler Murray and Dwayne Haskins.

When projecting NFL Draft prospects, evaluators have to consider a wide range of outcomes before putting their final grade on a player. Many of us attempt to answer, “What can this player do?” But often projections have to go deeper than that. Projections not only have to detail what a player can do, but what he can do in certain situations and environments. The raw player traits we study can help set expectations for our projections and determine floors and ceilings for incoming prospects. We can then generalize and bucket which traits translate to certain skills and which traits are attainable through practice and film study.



Nearly a year ago I generalized that quarterbacks with high level mental traits —e.g., processing speed and decision making — had higher ceilings than quarterbacks with superior athletic traits — e.g., arm strength and scramble ability. And athletically superior quarterbacks actually had higher floors than originally believed because their athleticism allowed them to compensate for deficiencies.



The idea originally stemmed from studying current Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen during the 2018 NFL Draft cycle. Allen possessed a rare level of arm strength and an excellent ability to make plays scrambling when the play broke down. But Allen struggled with processing speed, often waiting to see his target open before pulling the trigger, rather than anticipating the throwing window. This got Allen in trouble at times, but other times his rocket launcher for an arm proved to be the great equalizer for a QB with less than superb processing speed and decision making ability.



Allen’s arm strength and ability to use his legs carved out what I would call a successful first season in the NFL. Allen wasn’t a particularly good thrower of the ball, but he did enough in that area combined with his ability to scramble and break tackles to look like a solid “win with” QB. My projection on Allen was a bottom half of the league starter by his third year in the league that you could win with. That projection is two seasons away from being confirmed, but it’s seemingly on the right track.



The reasoning behind the projection was that while Allen didn’t have the processing speed, decision making, or accuracy you desire in a QB prospect, he did possess exceptional athleticism that could makeup for those weaknesses to set a baseline starter floor. He ultimately landed in a good situation as Bills’ offensive coordinator Brian Daboll schemed around Allen’s weaknesses and played to his strengths, allowing his QB to run wild while prescribing him a heavy dose of play action on dropbacks.



Of course, there’s more to it than blanket generalizations. Prospects have varying levels of mental and physical traits. Josh Allen just happened to be the extreme case.



The top two 2019 QB prospects, Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray and Ohio State’s Dwayne Haskins, allow for more nuance in their evaluations pertaining to their ceilings and floor. Murray possesses better athletic ability, arm talent, and accuracy, while Haskins possesses better knowledge of schemes, manipulation of defenders, and quicker processing speed.



As is often the case for non-transcendent QB prospects; landing spot is going to play a major role in their development. But studying their traits and how they succeed can point us to who’s the safer prospect in what environment.



And thus, there are a few conundrums a QB-needy War Room has to solve when pitting Murray against Haskins…



Does Murray’s athleticism outweigh Haskins’ mental traits?



Do the results matter more than the process?



Does our organization have the infrastructure in place to maximize this player’s potential?



Murray clearly possesses the better athleticism of the two. Just two months ago Murray was going to report to Spring Training for the Oakland Athletics before he declared he was all in on preparing for the 2019 Scouting Combine. Murray’s rare athleticism and speed would have allowed him to be a major league-level outfielder who could also be a nightmare when he got on base.



Murray’s speed and quickness are going to translate to skills that can benefit an NFL QB. Many are going to point to Murray’s size as a concern for why he may struggle in the NFL, but his athletic traits are more than enough to make up for any deficiency.



Against Oklahoma State, Murray displayed the ability to avoid pressure and escape the pocket prior to completing a pass off-platform. The Oklahoma State cornerback hides the slot blitz well on this play, not showing much indication of his intentions pre-snap. When the ball is snapped the slot CB rushes free inside of the right tackle, with the weakside linebacker blitzing to widen the edge.







Murray feels the rush and passes up an opportunity to throw to his RB open down the seam—more on that later—to improvise and scramble outside the pocket before completing a pass for a nice gain downfield.



Murray’s ability to evade pressure and avoid sacks is going to be an invaluable tool for him in the NFL. With his burst and quickness, he can scramble and create with his legs. Rookie QBs that come into the NFL unequipped to evade the rush struggle in their first year or two in the league. This is because the teams that are in need of a QB are most likely lacking pass protection too, as was the case for Josh Rosen and the Arizona Cardinals offensive line last season.



Rosen, despite facing a lot of pressure at UCLA in 2017, was sacked at the lowest rate (5.5%) among 2018 first-round QBs in his final collegiate season. This was due to his functional mobility that allowed him to climb the pocket and avoid rushers running the arc. In Arizona, Rosen was unable to avoid those sacks, going down on 10.3% of dropbacks, despite having the same level of functional mobility.



Murray could have an easier transition to the NFL in an environment like Arizona because of how dynamic he is and his ability to make throws off-platform.



Haskins, much like Rosen, has displayed he can maneuver in the pocket by sliding and climbing when pressure threatens. But overall, Haskins is a pure pocket passer who struggles to create outside of structure and doesn’t always display poise when pressured. He tends to backpedal and not stand his ground in the face of the rush, and he will sometimes create pressure by escaping the pocket too early as a result of feeling ghosts. Haskins struggles when he’s not allowed to step up in the pocket to throw and when he’s forced to move laterally to create throwing angles like on this play against Michigan State.



(Haskins pressured vs Michigan State)



Climbing the pocket to elude pressure is a skill that’s highly valued in QBs. But without the dynamic ability to create outside of structure, like Murray, the skill may not be as useful in year one if the pieces around the quarterback aren’t up to par. That makes a player like Haskins who struggles with accuracy in the face of pressure more reliant on the quality of his teammates.



Murray’s legs can add another element to an offense in ways Haskins cannot via the run game, whether on designed runs using read options to put defenders in conflict or taking off on dropbacks due to the void left by a Cover 2 Man defense. With offense’s adding more concepts from the college game, Murray’s ability to run can be more valuable in today’s evolving NFL than a pure pocket passer.



On the other hand, Murray’s athleticism can be a double-edged sword. If Murray relies too much on his legs to make plays instead of fully going through his progressions or taking what’s given, his athleticism could hinder his ability to develop as a QB. While the play I detailed earlier of Murray against Oklahoma State displayed his ability to feel and avoid the rush, the right process on that play is to check down to the open RB, who was the intended target after the scrambling occurred anyway.



Mark Schofield explains that while Murray often produces good results, the process is not always sound. For instance, this TD run against Army that Mark breaks down here. Players like Murray who possess rare athletic traits want to flex those abilities, sometimes to their detriment. It’s something to consider as he transitions to the NFL game.



On this play against Texas, Murray rolls to the outside, abruptly stops his momentum and recklessly targets the middle of the field. Murray doesn’t see the safety lurking, who ends up intercepting the throw because Murray rushes his post-snap process.





This is a recurring issue I’ve noted on quite a few of Murray’s interceptions. Against Texas Tech, Murray fails to recognize the defensive back near the line of scrimmage drop into coverage underneath, resulting in an INT.



(Murray INT vs Texas Tech)



Prior to the snap Murray recognizes the defensive back near the line of scrimmage indicating a blitz is potentially coming.



Murray uses cadence to attempt to get the defensive back to tip his hand prior to the snap. The defender looks to drop back into coverage as Murray fakes the snap count.



Murray confirms this by taking one last look to that side of the field before the ball is snapped.

Everything leading up to the snap is sound process and encouraging. The post-snap process is what is concerning for Murray. He locks onto receiver Marquise Brown and doesn’t see the defensive back he confirmed moments earlier playing underneath to cut off the curl.



From a processing speed standpoint Haskins grades out higher than Murray. At 6’3”, 218 pounds, with a well built frame, not only does Haskins looks the part of an NFL QB, but he also thinks like one. That’s a trait that can be the differentiator in some War Rooms.



Haskins’ ability to diagnose where the blitz is coming from pre-snap and change protections at the line of scrimmage is advanced for a first-year starter. Haskins is dedicated to his craft and spent all off-season working with then-offensive-coordinator Ryan Day on protections and responsibilities.



Haskins is also adept at processing information quickly in the post-snap phase, going through his progressions and pulling the trigger. This was something he hesitated to do at the start of the season, but he improved mightily as time progressed, becoming more comfortable throwing with anticipation, allowing his passes to arrive on time.





What separates Haskins from most QB in this class is how he reacts when the pre- and post-snap looks don’t align.



In a Film Room breakdown for the Big Ten Network, Haskins explained his pre- and post-snap thought process on this QB scramble for a gain of eight yards on 2nd and 9 against Michigan. Haskins explains that all week in practice SLB #59 was the blitzer. Because he believes #59 is blitzing, Haskins slides the protection to his right to pick up #59 and #10.



But Michigan goes against their tendency on the play by sending boundary pressure from the weak side with LB #12 and CB #28.



Haskins recognizes the blitz and knows he needs to react quickly to avoid taking a hit. He makes the smart decision to run to the soft spot of the protection and is able to pick up positive yardage. This play is a good example of Haskins processing information quickly and making the right decision.



(Haskins vs Michigan blitz pre/post snap decision)



Despite all the right things Haskins does in his preparation, process, and decision making, he lacks the results due to issues with his lower half mechanics that create inconsistencies with his accuracy. This is especially true on passes downfield.







Against Purdue, Haskins missed an opportunity to complete a deep pass to a wide open Terry McLaurin. The mechanical deficiency causing this relates to Haskins’ plant leg. Haskins has a tendency to keep his plant leg completely stiff when he finishes his throw and this causes him to sail the ball beyond his intended target.



In terms of accuracy, Murray is the most accurate QB in the 2019 draft. He possesses excellent arm talent to put the ball anywhere on his receiver to any distance of the field. Arm talent isn’t purely grading arm strength. Arm talent can also be defined as the feel a QB has for throwing the ball. Does he put enough velocity on passes thrown into tight windows? Can he take some velocity off to throw with touch? Does he have control of the trajectory of his passes? Can he throw from different platforms?



Murray displays the ability to throw with plus velocity and placement on this play against Oklahoma State, throwing a dart into the turkey hole of the Cover 2 defense for a completion.







Murray can also throw with excellent touch and trajectory to all depths of the field. Against Alabama, he executed a perfect touch pass with placement to his WR CeeDee Lamb, recognizing Lamb had leverage to the boundary setting up 1st and goal for Oklahoma’s offense.







With both prospects having just one full season as starters, there are still traits that have yet to fully develop, adding to the difficulty of projecting each of these QB’s floors and ceilings. Yet, both QBs are talented prospects and are deserving of being first-round selections.



Based on my evaluation of each player I prefer Kyler Murray to Dwayne Haskins. I’d take the advanced processor over the raw athletic QB in most drafts, but Murray can become a good “win with” QB that flashes “win because of” ability if everything comes together. That isn’t to knock Haskins, as both QBs have environments they can have success in.



Haskins environment fit: Best suited to enter an organization that has a stable infrastructure in place in the form of a quality offensive line. From there it would help for him to have one or two playmakers he can rely on, allowing him to act a distributor, making quick throws nears the line of scrimmage. Ideally he can utilize the mesh concept and take the occasional downfield shot. While not dynamic, Haskins has good functional mobility and would excel in an offense that called designed roll outs to get him throwing high-percentage passes on the run.



Murray environment fit: Best fits in a downfield offense because of his arm talent and pinpoint deep ball accuracy. His play caller should build in plays that create conflict and deception: e.g., RPOs, read options, play action. Using the read option inside the red zone to stretch a defense horizontally would be ideal, preferably in tandem with an equal threat to receive the pitch at RB. Murray doesn’t need a top notch offensive line unit because he can avoid pressure with his legs to create outside of structure and on the run.

On Monday, Michael Knowles discussed his ordeal at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where a group of Leftists disrupted his speech and one attempted to spray him with an unknown liquid. Not only has the faculty refused to apologize, but some of their staff have openly endorsed the actions of the students. A local newspaper even theorized that Knowles deserved it. Knowles breaks it all down in a special episode of “The Michael Knowles Show.”

There was this event last Thursday at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Many of you watched it. I was invited to give a lecture there on the topic, "Men Are Not Women." Pretty basic topic. If you took a time machine back to five years ago and told people that that would be a controversial topic in five years, they would laugh in your face. So, I go there, and I give this talk, I try to give this talk. From the very beginning, there was a group of about a dozen leftists screaming like banshees, screaming so loudly that the other people in the room could not hear it. Some of the people on video could hear because I was speaking directly into a microphone that was being broadcast.

People in the room couldn't because these leftists screamed like hyenas consistently for about 20 minutes. Eventually, they get up and they go to leave, and they are screaming all these crazy things at me. And then from behind me, out of my periphery, some leftist thug wearing a face mask and bandana, comes in and squirts some unknown chemical at me which had a very strong smell and it had a weird color. What he didn't realize is that the police were right by that door. They dropped him to the ground in a matter of seconds and they arrested him very quickly. He was fighting back. He did not count on there being any consequences to this. So, I went on and I made some jokes about it and tried to push on with the speech.

It was first then reported that it was paint that the guy tried to spray on me. That's kind of what I thought it was. Then a lot of people in the room who were closer to where the super soaker full of this chemical was were reporting that it was bleach. So obviously, it seems like the authorities in the room thought that this could be a dangerous chemical, which is why they responded so quickly. We later found out it was a non-toxic household chemicals. Seems pretty clear that the kid, this attacker, was trying to give the impression that it was some sort of dangerous chemical, but he wanted to avoid multiple felonies on his record, so probably that was smart for him. Regardless, the point of this is pretty clear.

First of all, it could've been anything that he was hurling onto a conservative speaker and what it really seems to be is a warning shot. Which is that if you don't shut up, if you don't kowtow to leftist orthodoxy, you will be intimidated, you'll be shouted down, and ultimately, you'll be physically attacked. Don't forget they didn't start out trying to physically attack me. They started out just trying to scream me down and hoping that I would leave and shut up. Only when I didn't do that, did this guy bust in and try to hurl some liquid on me. That was the ultimate point. So we know that this kind of violence has happened at universities. I'm not the first conservative speaker to be attacked, Charles Murray has been attacked. I think Christina Hoff Summers was attacked. This has happened at other places.

The more shocking thing here was the response. The response of the university, the chancellor of the University of Missouri-Kansas City Mauli Agrawal and the response of the Kansas City Star, and the mainstream media more broadly. What the left is doing here is trying to equate violence with nonviolence; that's the big takeaway. They've been doing it not just to me in this story over the past three days. They've done it to President Trump; they've done it to Dan Crenshaw. They're trying to equate violence with nonviolence. The university's reaction: the next morning a letter comes out from the chancellor's office. I expect there to be an apology to an invited speaker who was harassed and then assaulted… No no no.

Here's the letter from Chancellor Mauli Agrawal: "A student group brought a speaker to campus, a speaker who's professed opinions do not align with our commitment to diversity and inclusion and our goal of providing a welcoming environment to all people particularly to our LGBT community."

First of all, what's my stated opinion? The topic of the speech is "men are not women" and the university doesn't agree with that. Does the university think men are women? Also, the irony they said this doesn't speak to our values of diversity — I'm the only one talking about diversity. I'm saying there's a diversity of sexes. I'm saying there is diversity between men and women. You're the one saying that the sexes are completely homogenous. There's no such thing as women. There's only one sex, and we're all the same. There's no difference between men and women.

More broadly this guy opens up his letter not by condemning violence on campus, not by condemning the heckler's veto in these banshee behaving students who should be expelled from the university… No no no. He opens up the letter by baselessly smearing the invited speaker as some sort of bigot, and he said my opinions are not welcoming to the LGBT community. I'm some sort of anti-gay bigot. Now does he cite any of the opinions that are apparently so bigoted? No, of course not because he can't. What could he say? But that's how he begins.

So you can see where the letter is going to go from there. He says, "Upon learning of the speaker's visit members of the UMKC community responded in the best way, by organizing and conducting a counter event across campus Thursday afternoon focused on positive messages about diversity and inclusion."

First of all, that's not the best way to respond. The best way would be to go and listen to the speaker and then at a different time hold another event where people who disagree with you will go and then you will discuss these differing ideas, and people can come to their own conclusions. But to try to just distract from the event and try to pull people away from that actually isn't the best way to respond. He goes on: "Even during the speech some peaceful protesters stood and expressed disagreement with the speaker's views. Then, unfortunately, some others crossed a line."

No, what happened during the speeches from the very moment that I started to speak, these activists shrieked so loudly that nobody could hear the speech.

If a university chancellor believes that is one of the best ways to respond, then he is a disgrace to higher education. Mauli Agrawal is a disgrace to American higher education, to liberal education. He should resign. He should be pressured by the trustees and the alumni and the governor and the students to resign. That is an outrage. What he is saying in that letter, is that the best way to engage with ideas that we might not understand or that we might think that we disagree with or that we maybe never have heard before, is to scream at the top of our lungs like little children, like toddlers, until they are cowered and intimidated into leaving.

Mauli Agrawal, the chancellor of UMKC should resign or else the trustees, the alumni, and the governor are sending a message to every other college in the country, that it's perfectly fine to shout down speakers and to shout down views that are not trendy or faddish at the time. So, this disgrace to higher education, Mauli Agrawal goes on, after defending the heckler's veto after baselessly smearing an invited speaker as some sort of bigot he goes on. Imagine the message this university is sending out to say — hey speakers we'd like you to come to campus, we'd like you to fly across the country, take time out of your schedules to come here and give a speech. And by the way we're going to defend harassment and the heckler's veto. We're not really going to condemn political violence at least not primarily. We'll get to that eventually maybe. And by the way, we're going to baselessly smear you as a bigot. But come on. That's what the university is for.

He goes on, he says, "UMKC must maintain a safe environment in which all points of view even extreme ones are allowed to be heard."

I mentioned this one because in 2019 the opinion that men are not women is an extreme point of view. We hear a lot of sort of moral equivalence between the left and the right. Oh well you know the left they do their crazy things and the right they do their crazy things and come on… No no no. The chancellor of an American university, a state university, who is a left-winger is saying that the point of view that men are not women is extreme and then the right is saying men are not women. Those are not equally extreme crazy viewpoints — one of those is radical and the other is common sense. No equivalence whatsoever.

He says, "We continue to urge everyone in our UMKC community and the broader community to stay true to our values in the face of provocation and to respond to bias and intolerance with reason and courage to hardened attitudes with open minds and honest questions to false statements with calm fact-based challenges."

Listen to what this disgrace does in this letter. He says that the students need to respond to provocation in this way as though I was begging to go visit UMKC. I was begging to fly across the country to give the lecture, please let me come, please. I'll pay you to let me come. I was invited to the school, your school Mauli Agrawal, the school that you represent, invited me to come. You provoked me if anything.

Provocation? You invited me to speak on a specific topic, which I then did. And for that grave mistake that I apparently made taking Mauli Agrawal on face value, for that crazy mistake, I was harassed and physically assaulted.
Rio de Janeiro — O governo do Brasil formalizou nesta segunda-feira, 15, a decisão de deixar a União das Nações Sul-Americanas (Unasul) pouco depois de ser informado que a Bolívia havia passado para o país a presidência temporária do bloco.

“O governo brasileiro denunciou, no dia de hoje, o Tratado Constitutivo da Unasul, formalizando sua saída da organização”, informou o Ministério de Relações Exteriores em comunicado.

O governo Bolsonaro é crítico ao bloco, criado por Hugo Chávez, ex-presidente da Venezuela, com a intenção de fazer um contraponto aos Estados Unidos. Além do Brasil, Argentina, Colômbia, Chile e Equador já saíram do bloco.

Em abril de 2018, ainda no governo Temer, o país já havia suspendido sua participação no bloco.
district0x Dev Update - April 16th, 2019

Development progress and product changes from district0x

Alexander Khoriaty Blocked Unblock Follow Following Apr 16

The most recent development cycle from our service providers at district0x yielded several important enhancements across our open projects. Meme Factory received crucial administrative upgrades to the DANK faucet, as well as improvements to several navigation features and many content filter upgrades. Meanwhile, the District Registry continues to be hammered into shape, with several more pages and features being designed and worked into the app. Similarly, Ethlance previously received several pages of work from our designers, and since we’ve been building out the front-end components needed to house these designs.

Meme Factory

At this point, Meme Factory has had all of it’s basic functionality thoroughly battletested on Ropsten testnet. However, several aspects of our original implementation were ripe for deeper updates. Primary among these is the infinite scrolling feature to Meme Factory. Our previous implementation was inconsistent at best, and often slow to perform it’s duties when a user scrolls to the bottom of the page. We proceeded with several infrastructure updates to improve the speed of content polling, and refactored the pieces needed to smooth out the infinite scroll feature. Along with our ongoing work on the guided website tutorial, this has unfortunately introduced a few regressions, some of which we’re continuing to work through currently.

In addition to infinite scrolling, we’ve also been making smaller enhancements to grouping and filtering systems across the marketplace. We’ve added several radio buttons to group memes by different parameters — including the order of issuance and the cheapest memes on offer. We’ve also made several devops improvements to the re-syncing process on our test server, allowing us to reboot and resync quickly from cache instead of a complete sync from nothing. We’ve also introduced several redundancies to our IPFS services to prevent any unexpected loss of pinned content. This has come hand in hand with some optimizations to improve fetch times by minimizing image sizes.

Lastly, work with the DANK faucet has been proceeding accordingly, with several upgraded administrative features now in place. These include things like an auto-check against double claims, whereby we can verify a phone number as unique and unused before calling out to the contract to check. This will prevent all kind of unnecessary waste through gas and transaction fees. We’ve also added a variety of functions to allow us to reset the DANK distribution to particular users, as well as up the total allocation amount for all users (in case we ever want to re-distribute DANK to participants in the future). On the whole, we have gone from having a simple straightforward faucet that spits out DANK when you give it a number to a more complete tool for managing alll manner of DANK distribution post-launch.

District Registry

The District Registry remains in a very similar development state as the previous update. With the arrival of a new batch of design work, we were able to start constructing the final versions of each registry webpage, and identify any blind spots or missing buttons/feature we would have missed earlier in the development cycle. With each passing week, as more of the larger issues are resolved, the smaller ones appear, requiring additional design work. These include very minor elements (like a custom made 404 page, and additional fancy loading spinners) that will ultimately lend to a much fuller and unique experience. Efforts will continue in this manner until we can no longer see any room for improvement, at which point we will return to the requirements for completing our Aragon integration.

Ethlance

Ethlance, like the District Registry, is at the point of receiving most of its design assets and hammering out any unexpected or missing assets for further development. As mentioned in prior development updates, Ethlance is sharing development resources with service providers also contributing towards Meme Factory, and as such has had little visible progress in the past two weeks in favor of further polishing of front end components for Meme Factory. However, with these aspects to Meme Factory’s development nailed down, efforts and resume towards restyling Ethlance components in accordance with the process we’ve used for the District Registry.

In the coming weeks, the team will be working to migrate Meme Factory to a real production server environment, as well as testing ghost contracts on the actual Ethereum mainnet to confirm nothing has changed from our QA instance to a live public one. It’s been a very long journey for Meme Factory, but we’re excited to get our latest application into the hands of the users, and to apply the hard lessons we’ve learned from this development journey towards future projects.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been given an award established in honour of an assassinated journalist.

Assange, jailed in England last week after being forcibly removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, was awarded the 2019 GUE/NGL Award for Journalists, Whistleblowers & Defenders of the Right to Information.

It is sponsored by European parliamentarians after being established in 2018 in honour of assassinated Maltese journalist Daphne Galizia.

The award is given to individuals "uncovering the truth and exposing it to the public" and to honour "individuals or groups who have been intimidated and/or persecuted for uncovering the truth and exposing it to the public".

Nobel Peace prize winner Mairead Maguire, from Belfast, collected the award on Assange's behalf at an event in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor, said: "Through WikiLeaks Julian Assange's vision of transparency has revolutionalised journalism.

"His imprisonment and threatened extradition to the United States has drawn a sharp line in the sand. You are either encouraging the crackdown on media freedom or you are standing with Julian Assange."

Last year the Galizia prize was jointly awarded to murdered Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak and LuxLeaks whistleblower Raphael Halet.

Assange had lived inside the embassy for almost seven years before his diplomatic asylum was revoked.

Stressing transparency in government, more than a half-dozen Democrats running for the White House have released their tax returns.

And while the filings are a way for the Democratic candidates to spotlight Republican President Trump’s refusal to release his taxes -- both as a 2016 White House candidate and as a sitting president -- the returns also have revealed that some of the biggest class warriors of the 2020 field happen to be among the wealthiest.

AT FOX NEWS TOWN HALL, BERNIE SANDERS MAKES NO APOLOGIES FOR HIS WEALTH

"This year, we had $560,000 in income," Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont explained Monday night during a Fox News town hall.

Minutes before the start of the town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the independent senator from Vermont’s presidential campaign released his 2018 returns. According to the figures, Sanders and his wife Jane paid a 26 percent effective tax rate on $561,293 in income, and made more than $1 million in both 2016 and 2017. Nearly $400,000 of his income last year came from book sales.

Sanders doubled down on his previous defenses of his wealth, which even some progressives have criticized considering his advocacy for an increase in the tax rates the wealthiest Americans pay.

2020 CANDIDATES' TAX RETURNS: BY THE NUMBERS

"In my and my wife's case, I wrote a pretty good book. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it," he said.

And Sanders, who’s faced calls for the past month to release his returns, acknowledged that he had been "fortunate" even as he pushed for a more progressive tax system.

WARREN RELEASES RETURNS MOMENTS AFTER PUSHING WEALTH TAX

Sanders isn’t the only populist senator running for the White House whose tax returns indicate income in the upper six-digits.

Minutes after pushing her proposal to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released her tax returns last week. The figures show that the Massachusetts Democrat and her husband Bruce – a professor at Harvard University – paid more than $230,000 in taxes last year on just over $846,000 in adjusted income, for an effective tax rate of 27 percent. Warren made about $325,000 in book sales in addition to the $175,000 salary she receives as a senator. Her husband earned around $400,000 from Harvard.

The wealthiest Democrat among those 2020 candidates who’ve so far made their tax returns public is Sen. Kamala Harris of California.

The former Golden State attorney general and her husband – attorney Doug Emhoff – reported an adjusted income of nearly $1.9 million in 2018. They paid nearly $700,000 in taxes, for an effective rate of 37 percent. Besides her Senate income, Harris earned around $320,000 in income from writing a book that was published earlier this year. Her husband earned $1.5 million for his work as an attorney.

While Harris is reporting the most income of the candidates who’ve so far released their 2018 tax returns, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland appears to be the wealthiest candidate in the field of Democratic presidential nomination contenders.

Last year, the then-three-term congressman was listed as the sixth wealthiest member of Congress, with an estimated net worth of $92.6 million according to rankings from Roll Call. Delaney, who grew up in a working-class family in New Jersey, became the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.

According to his first quarter of fundraising report, the candidate infused $11.7 million of his own money into his campaign, making up the vast majority of the $12.1 million he brought in during the first three months of the year.

Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and his wife, meanwhile, made $366,455 – according to their 2017 returns – paying an effective tax rate of 22 percent. The candidate released 10 years of returns on Monday, but didn’t include his 2018 taxes.

"As a candidate aspiring to restore the American people's trust in the nation's highest office, O'Rourke will also release his 2018 tax returns as soon as possible after they are filed," his campaign explained.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and her husband earned $338,121 last year, paying a 19 percent effective tax rate. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and her husband earned nearly $215,000 in income last year, paying an effective tax rate of 14 percent.

GILLIBRAND THE FIRST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO RELEASE TAX RETURNS

Gillibrand became the first of the 2020 Democrats to make public her returns, when she released her returns on March 27.

“Join me in calling on every presidential candidate to disclose their taxes. This is what transparency and accountability is all about,” Gillibrand said in a video at the time, as she challenged the rest of the Democratic 2020 contenders to make their returns public.

Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee also released his returns, indicating that he and his wife earned nearly $203,000 last year, paying an effective tax rate of 15 percent.
A new movie on Creation, the label behind My Bloody Valentine, Oasis, the Jesus & Mary Chain, Slowdive, Primal Scream, and dozens more artists, is in the works. Danny Boyle will executive-produce Creation Stories and Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh are the screenwriters, Deadline reports. Nick Moran, who has helmed Telstar: The Story of Joe Meek and The Kid, will direct the film, which is based on founder Alan McGee’s memoir The Creation Records Story: Riots, Raves and Running a Label. Also starring are Rupert Everett (My Best Friend’s Wedding), Suki Waterhouse (Assassination Nation), and Jason Fleming (Snatch). In the lead role, Ewen Bremner—Spud in Trainspotting—plays McGee.

Boyle and Welsh famously teamed up on the original Trainspotting, with Boyle directing the adaptation of Welsh’s novel. Welsh said of Creation Stories, “I’ve been lucky to work with both Danny and Nick over the years and to have the two of them together on this project, along with Ewen, feels like a lottery win.” Shooting begins in London next month.

I do like when I don’t have to come up with a good idea for an article. Much better to find someone elses and steal it. A few weeks ago I happened upon a facebook thread where a group of female martial arts enthusiasts discussed the anxiety they felt the first time they walked into an Mixed Martial Arts or other martial arts class.

I forget sometimes how male dominated the sport is and how intimidating it might be for young women to just breeze into a club or a class and just start swinging;especially where the vast majority of members are male.

The idea for the original post was that Indra Davis was trying to encourage a new member that had more than a little anxiety about the idea of rolling on the mats for the first time. The comments and responses to the post illustrated to the student that it was an anxiety that most if not all of the women faced and overcame. In other words she wasn’t alone. Imagine if all teachers went to this much trouble for a pupil. What an educational system we would have. Anyway let’s get to the good stuff!

Melissa Miskell

Oh man, sat nav’d my way to Shaolin, made it through the front door and my heart was pounding, very nearly turned just as quickly out the door shouting “nope” to myself 😂😂😂

When I got a very smiley friendly hello from Indra Davis at the top of the stairs so up I went and made a new life long friend in her and met my coach, got absolutely hooked after my first ever double leg takedown 😂 I never knew what jiu-jitsu was before that day and I am damn glad i didn’t turn away 😂😂

Now I have faced new fears through competing in the sport and it’s a very worthwhile journey for continuous personal growth 💖💖

Aisling Ni Fhalluin

Stepping on the mats for that first time was probably one of the scariest things I’ve ever done, I was suffering with severe anxiety at the time & something led me to Shaolin. A random new Facebook friend Fiona O’Neill & me both met and weathered that first experience together. My heart was beating just as fast as my mind was racing & (even though my coordination is as bad as ever 😂) it was worse then & I felt like I never really had any control of my movements. I was always only ever in fight or flight mode on and off the mats because of my anxiety but you were there Indra Davis & told me that before you started you could barely tell your right from your left too and those words combined with some encouragement from Ben Davis & spotting Melissa Miskell who looked beautifully fierce & strong tearing into the bag doing ground and pound with such control, passion, and technique gave me hope that one day I might be able to improve myself too surrounded by the right people and right then I decided that I’d keep returning no matter how scared I initially was. Still so much to improve upon but my anxiety (except for a normal bad day we all have) is gone, I walk around a lot lighter, & even though my sense of direction & coordination is still atrocious I move from a place not of a hostile war within myself but from within a much more calmer space. Thank you for everything; family always ☯️🖤💛

Sadie Keary

Nervous badly nervous .. but the club is a family not like other clubs I’ve seen where some is to themselves and others the same everyone is with everyone we all click no matter the background … I loved fighting before this but now there is a whole new level of love between the members of the club and coaches ur made feel at home from day one anyway 💙 best club sublaws and subleens

Kelly Campbell Ward

Was too afraid to come out of the changing rooms and rang my mam to collect me but Benjamin convinced me to stay and I haven’t stopped going since then 💪🏻❤️

Rosa Walsh

To be completely honest – I started jiu-jitsu on my own, for a boy unfortunately when I was 16, and he wasn’t even there my first class!. A ten year old was my first training partner and I was absolutely smoked , left feeling a little shook but intrigued- put 100% in the class and ended up vomiting later on that night due to exhaustion😂😂

I had been boxing from a young age before that and my boxing coach was like a grandad to me so I never had an issue with not feeling welcome. He was super protective over me being the only girl .Both boxing and jiu- jitsu always made me feel super welcome, never spoke about other girls etc.. as boys do 😂.

I think it was a welcoming arrival to boxing and jiu-jitsu was definitely the reason I am still here 4 years later and still the only girl ❤️

Catherine Boa Connolly

I remember walking into Team Caveman for the first time! I was so scared I could hardly talk to the Head Coach Sean.. There were only men in the club and I asked myself what the hell am I doing here 😂 Sean introduced himself to me and everyone in the team. They were so helpful and managed to get me relaxed and involved with the class.. Walking through them doors was the best thing I ever did. I was hooked on bjj from the first night I started 😀 I couldn’t ask for a nicer team/family to be apart of! I was welcomed with big hugs. I am truly grateful for everything my professors Sean Davitt, Adonias Miranda Filho and team mates have done for me.. I’ll be 3 years with Team Caveman PGT Ireland next month and it’s been an amazing journey so far 😃

Sineadh Ni Nuallain

My 1st lord help me😂 I was so nervous!! 😂 there wasn’t a girl in sight as you said yourself Indra Davis !! I fell in love with all my martials arts bjj, k1, mma so much I couldn’t not go back🤷🏽‍♀️🤘🏻 having no girls led me down to you girliess at Shaolin and I’m grateful because now I have a group of gals to train with, especially Melissa Miskell💪🏻❤️❤️

Zlata Lovett

My first day, it was cool. I didn’t had any emotional or psychological difficulties tho as I knew that I don’t know anything and I’m there to learn… My amazing colleague at the time Dawid took me to a Cathal Mannings gym for my first ever kickboxing class, it was fun, I had no idea what am I doing, but I liked it 😂.

I think after 2 classes there Dawid and Sebastian brought me along to Shaolin in our Ladies boys club, at the time, that was the day I met Indra, Benjamin and Rowan 😁 Indra partnered up with me and made me feel so welcomed 🖤 also that was the day when Ollie tried to choke me unconscious( I didn’t know yet what rolling was and I was chosen to roll after class. Also I didn’t know what was tapping either 😂🙈).

Priscilla Batista

I started Muay Thai when I was 15, so 11 years ago. I never intended to be professional just for fun. The second month I was training my coach asked if I wanted to fight in an internal competition and I said Yes. After that I’d never leave martial arts anymore (he said that in that fight me and my partner looks like two dogs fighting 🤣🤣 I had no idea what I was doing!)

I found it easy to start Muay Thai, and I loved since day 1, in jiu jitsu the history was different I was 21 and couldn’t accept my ridiculous motor coordination that didn’t allow me to even do “scape the hips” on the warm up or repeat the same technique in 3 classes and completely forget about in 4th class 😂😂

As usual, I’m persistent and Jiu Jitsu become my life now 💕

Amy Nesbitt

I started the beginners course with my work friend ,walked in and about 20 lads warming up..stood at door contemplating whether to leave or not, Then I heard in room next door Melissa Miskell taking the women’s class and I went in and never looked back . Got addicted straight away💕☯️

Reah Higgins

” I never intended to have a “first”. The coach just persuaded me to join in with my son, rather than watching. “Sure tis just like a fitness class” he said. And it was at first I guess but then I got more and more into it. We all joined as a family, gave it our all. Never missed a class, attended all the competitions. I will never forget the sense of achievement and the surprise as I improved, managed new moves and became more flexible. I began to love the sport and realised the whole ethos behind it from going to other clubs/comps. Seeing it all first hand helped me to respect something I did not even understand before. But unfortunately I didn’t have the wonderful experience of a good coach like the rest of ye here, I just did not feel he had my back. He was good at the actual sport I guess but totally missed out on the emotional and psychological support I (and others) needed. This should never be underestimated in my opinion. You can do it for yourself for so long and as a team you support one another but at the end of the day you need your coach to “get you” and to know how to carry you through. You can only so so much by yourself. It is so lovely to read the positive experiences above… For me “the first” I will never forget is my first competition. I made up my mind that day I was not going to fight but my hubby threw my gear in the car as we left. Our son fought and won. All the kids were so happy for him and then turned to me and said “Sure if he can do it so can you”. What choice did that leave me?! So I fought… And won!… And had to fight again in the final… And won!… But I did not go into those fights with the belief I would win. I was petrified and felt inadequate after seeing some amazing and experienced fights. So I told myself “Just do your best and try to score something. If you can get a score that is success for today and you can walk away without total despair”. So I focused on score after score rather than the fight as a whole.. Unfortunately I felt no support afterwards, no “well done” and no advice on what I could have done differently to improve for the next time. And that in itself stripped me of my confidence so there was no “next time”… So Indra and Ben, give yourselves a massive clap on the back. Ye recognise how important the mind is, aswell as the body, you create a family-like club with great support. And that is what makes you hugely successful… Big up 👏💜👏 “

Fiona O’Neill

I remember that feeling of family as soon as I went to Shaolin with Aisling Ni Fhalluin. We had signed up for the beginners course, there was no backing out. We had tried another club and although my experience there was great I just felt more at home at Shaolin 🏡😊. I knew that was were I wanted to be.

It was such a welcoming atmosphere and everyone was so nice. I remember getting stared at because i didn’t bow before I got on the mats, as a beginner I didn’t know any better.

I honestly can’t wait to get back if / when that time comes, even if its just to train again or throw a few punches on the bag. ☯️👪♥️

On a hot night last July, I walked into a bar appropriately named Loves Me Not, expecting my first date not to show up. We’d made plans to meet here, more than a week prior, but when I opened Hinge earlier that day to confirm, our conversation was missing. Although grabbing a drink with Andrew was on my calendar, my list of matches no longer included anyone by that name.

Had he unmatched me as a way of canceling? Or was it some kind of technical goof, and he was still planning to show up? Or had I simply imagined those plans, like a mirage in a wasteland where follow-through and basic human decency are scarce? In such a climate, it’s easy to get thirsty.

I had no idea. In today’s dating culture of extreme flakiness, people “ghost” at any and all points: Right after you’ve matched on an app, after a few texts are exchanged, after a few dates, even after months or years of dating. Although it was plausible that someone would make specific plans and then cancel without actually canceling, I’d never experienced this particular disappearing act, where someone makes plans and then cuts off all methods of communication.

Andrew did not walk through the doors of Loves Me Not that night. I ordered a pizza and dirty martini anyway and savored them while wondering what to call this confusing experience.

Nearly a year later, I have an answer. Rachel Thompson, a single woman in London, coined the term “cloaking” to describe it. “Cloaking is when a person doesn’t just stand you up for a date, they also block you on any app that you’ve previously communicated on,” Thompson describes in a video for Mashable.

It’s as though your date is donning a Harry Potter invisibility cloak. Not showing up would be ghosting. But cloaking involves taking steps to hide yourself even more — leaving someone no way to contact you. (Simply unmatching on a dating app qualifies.)

“It’s really a humiliating thing to go through,” Thompson said in her video. “But it’s also a really common thing.”

She has been through it herself. She also met a guy on Hinge. They hit it off, exchanging flirty messages about their shared love of pasta and burrata — and made plans to meet for Italian food later that night. But when she sent him a WhatsApp message to say she was on her way, he didn’t respond. She didn’t even get the standard read receipt WhatsApp usually sends. When Thompson clicked over to Hinge, their conversation was gone. She sent him an iMessage. No response.

I went through a similar period of silence and confusion with Andrew. We’d made plans but hadn’t exchanged phone numbers, so I couldn’t text him. I had his first and last name, so the day our date was supposed to happen, I sent a Facebook message to see if we were still on. No reply.

I even wrote to Hinge support to see if they had any clues. “With respect to Andrew’s privacy,” Hinge wrote back, “I can tell you that when a member disappears from your Matches it could be that they either deliberately or accidentally removed your profile from their Matches, or that they deleted their Hinge profile. I’m really sorry about the confusion around this.”

At this point, just a few hours before our supposed date, I probably should have made other plans for the evening. But even though most people on dating apps seem to be total flakes, I am not. I would show up just in case he did, too.

Thompson also stuck around for a drink just in case her date showed up. Eventually, she gave up, ordered an Uber and joined her friends for Chinese food instead. Her Uber driver was furious on her behalf, she said, wondering: “How could someone do that to you?”

Thompson didn’t want this person to get away with his bad dating etiquette. “While I was putting my highlighter on my face, and getting excited for the date, he was busy blocking me on every single app. I was so frustrated, because obviously I wanted to say something and just be like: ‘That is not cool. Like, what are you doing?’ ”

But with no way to reach him, she couldn’t even do that. Instead, she created a word for this weird, humiliating experience.

After Thompson took to Twitter, she found out that many people have been cloaked. “I feel like having a word for it helps to unite people and helps validate those experiences,” she said.

It sure does. And like Thompson, I found a way to salvage the evening. After finishing my pizza and martini, I walked to my new favorite ice cream shop and picked up several pints — one for myself, another for my friend who was having a miscarriage and a third for friends who were adjusting to life with a newborn.

This wasn’t just going to be the night I was stood up. It was going to be the night I did something nice for the people in my life who do show up for me.

The closest star to the solar system may have yet another planet. Proxima Centauri, which is just about 4.2 light-years away, may be home to a frigid world six times as big as Earth.

Mario Damasso at the Observatory of Turin in Italy and Fabio Del Sordo at the University of Crete announced their find at the Breakthrough Discuss conference in California on 12 April. They spotted the new exoplanet, called Proxima c, by looking for signs of the star wiggling back and forth as it is pulled by an orbiting planet’s gravity.

This is the same method used by a different group of astronomers in 2016 to detect Proxima Centauri’s other planet, Proxima b. But while Proxima b may orbit in the star’s habitable zone, where it’s neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water on the planet’s surface, Proxima c is much farther out, about 1.5 times the distance between Earth and the sun.

That means that it is very cold, around -233° C. From the star’s wiggles, it appears that Proxima c takes about 1936 Earth days to circle its star and is about six times the size of Earth, making it an example of a super-Earth. It’s possible that Proxima c formed closer to its star and then migrated outward, Del Sordo said.

The researchers emphasised that Proxima c is still just an exoplanet candidate – it will take more observations to prove that it’s really there. “We asked ourselves many times if this is a real planet,” said Del Sordo. “But what is sure is that even if this planet is a castle in the air, we should keep working to put even stronger foundations under it.”

One thing that could throw a wrench into the detection is that these sort of wiggles could be caused by several smaller planets in different orbits rather than just one big one.

“My concern is that there are maybe other planets hiding in this system that we haven’t found yet,” said Lauren Weiss at University of Hawaii. Only time, and more observations, will tell whether Proxima c is really there. “All we can do is just keep working, and it’s going to be a long road.”

En lo que representó una amarga novedad que impactó duramente en el seno del Gobierno, varias empresas alimenticias y cadenas de hipermercados comenzaron a remarcar un conjunto de productos de la canasta básica, con aumentos que trepan al 16%, y justo en medio de una negociación contrarreloj de cara a los anuncios que dará el miércoles el presidente Mauricio Macri.

Fuentes del sector del retail y la industria admitieron a BAE Negocios que existió una remarcación de precios en alimentos y limpieza durante el fin de semana y que continuó ayer, como consecuencia del aumento de los costos en los últimos meses. En el caso de Molinos, surgió una lista para supermercados y mayoristas con aumentos del 9% en sus yerbas Nobleza Gaucha y Cruz Malta; y del 5% en el aceite Cocinero. La Paulina confirmó una suba de los lácteos de entre el 5% y 6%, en tanto que la sal Dos Anclas subirá hasta un 16% y el arroz Carogran, que envasa para las marcas propias de supermercados, aumentó 12%.

Los nuevos valores de los productos de la canasta básica llegaron a las góndolas de los supermercados antes del esperado anuncio oficial, lo que ya produjo un profundo malestar en la Casa Rosada porque el plan era que los consumidores no vivieran nuevos incrementos en este período. Con los argumentos en torno a la suba de costos, la industria del sector alimenticio se anticipó al megaanuncio y queda por ver cuál será la eficacia de los "precios congelados", especialmente por el lado del abastecimiento.

Los supermercados dicen que el precio base del litro de leche en Precios Cuidados será de $35

Las compañías y grandes cadenas de supermercados tomaron la decisión de remarcar sus precios mientras el jefe de Gabinete, Marcos Peña, negaba que el Gobierno fuera a poner en marcha un plan de congelamiento. Los incrementos incluso tienen plazos de entrada en vigencia hacia "fines de abril y principios de mayo", agregaron a este medio desde los supermercados, con lo que la pretensión gubernamental de instalar un clima de armonía en el mercado ya se ve frustrada.

Además, de acuerdo con las fuentes privadas, los precios conocidos y otros que están en vías de aumento en góndola alcanzarán todos los formatos: hipermercados, tiendas exprés, autoservicios, almacenes y supermercados chinos. En el caso de la yerba que, en promedio, registrará una suba del 9%, se debe a que el Gobierno acaba de reconocerle una recomposición del 37,5% a los productores. En definitiva, lo que ocurre ahora refiere al inevitable traslado de aquel incremento a las góndolas.

Leche más cara

El Gobierno y las empresas afinan la letra del acuerdo para fijar los valores de la canasta de productos esenciales. El ministro de Producción y Trabajo, Dante Sica, adelantó que ampliarán la oferta de leche pero "el precio mínimo pasaría de $25 a $35", apuntaron desde las grandes superficies comerciales.

Macri anunciará una canasta de 40 a 50 productos "esenciales" y no sería una buena señal que la leche, el alimento básico que más escasea en las góndolas, tenga un aumento del orden del 30%. Según supo el portal TN de fuentes oficiales y del sector privado, la Secretaría de Comercio Interior negocia para incorporar una nueva marca de Mastellone (que fabrica la leche Armonía), en formato sachet, y una segunda marca de Adecoagro, la firma que compró activos de SanCor. En este caso, la leche sería en envase UAT, larga vida.

Borussia Dortmund have the highest average attendance in world football with an average of 80,000 people attending the Signal Iduna Park between 2013 and 2018.

Manchester United came second and Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid made up the top five according to the CIES Football Observatory.

Arsenal came in 7th, Manchester City in 12th, Liverpool in 21st, Chelsea in 33rd and Tottenham a place behind in 34th.

Borussia Dortmund have the highest average attendance in football with an average of 80,000

Sunderland were 38th on the list even though they play in League One.

The Black Cats were higher than Lyon, Juventus, Napoli, Everton, Roma and Valencia.

Atlanta United were the most popular non-European club as they sat 10th on the list.

The study analysed match attendances in 51 national football elagues situated in 42 different countries.

As a league as a whole, Germany's Bundesliga leads the way with an average attendance of 43,302 across the division.
La titular de la Oficina Anticorrupción (OA), Laura Alonso, reconoció que no interviene como querellante en las causas de corrupción que involucran al Gobierno por una especie de cansancio por las múltiples “acusaciones personales" que recibe y desató un gran escándalo. Ahora, referentes del kirchnerismo la denunciarán penalmente por “incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionaria pública” por no involucrarse en las denuncias judiciales de la actual gestión.

"En este momento no estamos querellando en ninguna de esas causas para que (no) me acusen de encubridora en las causas y de ir a embarrar causas de la corrupción", lanzó la funcionaria en una entrevistada con Luis Majul en La Cornisa, programa emitido en la noche de este domingo 14 de abril por el canal América. Esto generó fuerte indignación en la oposición y la diputada por el FPV, Gabriela Cerruti junto a los abogados Gregorio Dalbón y Maximiliano Rusconi tomaron la iniciativa de denunciarla penalmente.

Cerruti, Dalbón y Rusconi denunciarán a Alonso por los delitos de incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionaria pública y abuso de autoridad. "Hoy estamos denunciando a Laura Alonso por abuso de autoridad e incumplimiento de los deberes de funcionaria pública. Tenemos que frenar la locura que reina en la Oficina Anticorrupción”, explicó Cerruti en su cuenta de Twitter.

La legisladora cuestionó a la funcionaria al asegurar que “su decisión política implica sólo impulsar causas contra funcionarios y funcionarias de otras gestiones", en referencia a las causas que enfrentan funcionarios del gobierno de Néstor y Cristina Kirchner.

Por su parte, Dalbón expresó que “esperamos la renuncia de Laura Alonso. Sino el despido de la misma por parte de su enamorado Mauricio Macri. Si un Fiscal no la denuncia tengan por cierto que habrá muchas denuncias de abogados e instituciones que la sacará de su cargo, en breve tiempo".
New research from computer security analysts dangles the possibility of a link between WikiLeaks and Iranian government hackers, by way of a server in Moscow that was used by both within a span of weeks.

The research by Virginia-based ThreatConnect involves a notorious hacking campaign that targeted more than 500 diplomats, journalists, human rights workers, scientists, and researchers, primarily in the Middle East. The hackers used spear phishing to lure targets into installing malware or entering their passwords into a fake login page. Though technically unremarkable, the hacks stood out for the brazen persistence of the attackers, who in some cases followed up their phishing emails with a phone call encouraging the victim to open the attachment.

The Israeli security company ClearSky detected the campaign in May 2015, and from a number of clues attributed it to the hacking organization “Rocket Kitten,” also known as “APT33,” which has been linked to the government of Iran.

ThreatConnect’s three-page report connects some tentative dots between that attack, which targeted Saudi Arabia more than any other country, and WikiLeaks’ release a few weeks later of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables taken from Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry—and suggests that WikiLeaks may have worked with Rocket Kitten to engineer its own leak.

The research comes on the heels of the Thursday arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are seeking Assange’s extradition on a charge of conspiring to crack an Army password to help leaker Chelsea Manning in 2010.

The June 2015 Saudi Arabia files marked WikiLeaks’ first high-profile release after resurrecting its leak submission system that May following five years of downtime. Two weeks after the Saudi release, WikiLeaks began growing its infrastructure and expanded its website hosting onto a rented server in Moscow.

And that’s what got ThreatConnect’s interest. The IP address of WikiLeaks’ new server in July 2015 had last been seen in May 2015 hosting the website login-users[.]com, a fake Google Drive login page used in the Rocket Kitten phishing attacks.

Under some circumstances, a single IP address can host thousands of websites in a low-cost shared hosting arrangement. But that’s not the case here. “This IP was part of a range of dedicated HostKey servers,” notes the report. “This indicates that a single actor or collective had control over the infrastructure hosted at this IP.”

That suggests to the researchers that WikiLeaks may have hosted the phishing site itself to help out Iran’s hackers, perhaps in exchange for the leaked cables, just as Assange allegedly helped Manning.

“We cannot definitively state who was behind the attack that resulted in the files WikiLeaks released, or if that domain was a part of that attack,” said Kyle Ehmke, an intelligence researcher at ThreatConnect. “But the timing, co-location, and overlap in potential source and leaker are seemingly too significant to be coincidental.”

But the report acknowledges several other more innocent scenarios that might explain how WikiLeaks, after posting a big leak of hacked files from Saudi diplomats, wound up controlling a slice of internet that was used to hack Saudi diplomats a few weeks earlier.

For one, the Iranian hackers may have transferred the phishing server to Assange after the hacking was done. ​”This may have facilitated the transfer of files from the malicious actor to Wikileaks if the stolen files were stored at a server on that IP,” ThreatConnect wrote. “Wikileaks domains being first hosted at this IP after the malicious domain is possibly evidence of this explanation.”

It could also just be a coincidence, the report notes. WikiLeaks could have been randomly assigned the same dedicated IP address after the Iranian hackers were finished with it.

Eyal Sela, head of threat intelligence at ClearSky, favors that last theory. He said WikiLeaks may have innocently obtained Rocket Kitten’s old address if both groups happened to use the same “bulletproof hosting” provider, a no-questions-asked reseller with a small inventory of servers.

“I obviously cannot be sure, but this makes more sense to me then the other theories,” Sela told The Daily Beast.

Complicating things further, Iran’s Rocket Kitten may not have been the only state-sponsored hackers on the playing field.

WikiLeaks claimed at the time that the Saudi leak came from a completely different group of hackers who also purportedly targeted Saudi diplomats in May 2015: the Yemen Cyber Army. If so, it wouldn’t be the last time Assange received documents from that particular hacker group. In 2017, the Senate Intelligence Committee identified Yemen Cyber Army as a false front for Russia’s GRU.
BALADA O TROBENTI IN OBLAKU





Čas druge svetovne vojne. Na samotni kmetiji sredi zasneženih gora se Temnikarjevi pripravljajo na praznovanje božiča. Starega Temnikarja (Lojze Potokar) že od jutra mučijo prisluhi zloveščih zvokov trobente, ko se na vratih nenadoma pojavijo belogardisti in povedo, da gredo pokončat ranjene partizane, ki so skriti v neki votlini. Temnikar ve, da jim mora to preprečiti. Čeprav je star mož in je sneg globok, pograbi sekiro ter se odpravi čez drn in strn, da bi belogardistom prekrižal pot.

Mračna, a razsvetljujoča, blodna, a nedvoumno jasna ekspresionistična balada o težki (tu zlasti etični) eksistenci navadnih ljudi med narodnoosvobodilnim bojem. Vrtoglavo atipičen partizanski film, ki ga vendarle podpirata tipična stebra slovenske duše: secirana psihologija “trenutkov odločitve” ter sekira kot orodje in orožje.

“Štiglic je Baladi pustil, da je film. Filmu je pustil, da je film. Pustil mu je, da halucinira. Filmi so najboljši, ko halucinirajo. Ob Temnikarju se pač sprašuješ to, kar se v Scorsesejevem Taksistu sprašuješ ob Travisu Bicklu, ki ga igra Robert De Niro, ali pa to, kar se ob Boormanovi Čistini sprašuješ ob Walkerju, ki ga igra Lee Marvin: je res živ ali pa je vse, kar se dogaja, le njegova predsmrtna blodnja? /…/ Je že mrtev ali pa se je vrnil od mrtvih, da bi lahko umrl junaško in dostojno, kot Peckinpahova Divja banda, in da bi si zagotovil mesto v zgodovini ali pa, še raje, v muzeju novejše zgodovine? Je že mrtev ali pa še vedno – tako kot križarski vitez (Max von Sydow) v Bergmanovem Sedmem pečatu – šahira s smrtjo, da bi svojo smrt odložil? Atmosfera – mrka, hladna, apokaliptična – diši po obdukciji. V obeh filmih. Balada, posneta v času, ko se intimizirali in subjektivizirali tudi jugoslovanski partizanski, enobejevski filmi (Đorđevićeva trilogija Dekle/Sen/Jutro, Petrovićev Tri, Pavlovićeva Zaseda), je le navidez klicala po parodiji – v resnici je klicala po koncu filma.”

– Marcel Štefančič, jr., Maškarada: Strašne fantazije slovenskega filma (1948–1990)


Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez raised eyebrows during an interview Sunday when she said the possibility of cutting military or economic aid to Israel is "on the table" after the election of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Ocasio-Cortez was on Yahoo News’ “Skullduggery” podcast when she said Netanyahu's election comes during a disturbing trend of "authoritarianism across the world" and called the leader a "Trump-like figure."

Netanyahu has pledged to “apply sovereignty” to Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He told Israeli Channel 12 TV that, “we will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty."

"I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements," he continued, The Associated Press reported. "From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians."

The annexation of large parts of the West Bank could damage hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967. The New York Times reported that American officials have discouraged any Israeli attempt to extend sovereignty in the disputed territory.

Trump has recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term. The Palestinians, who seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their capital, suspended contact with the U.S. Trump has also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The move was viewed in Israel as a political gift from Trump to Netanyahu.

This is not the first time that the freshman representative talked about the tension in the region.

Ocasio-Cortez in July was forced to explain her comment on PBS’ “Firing Line” when she referred to the “occupation of Palestine.” Republicans took the comment to criticize her knowledge on the region. The host of the show, Margaret Hoover, asked a follow-up question and Ocasio-Cortez admitted, “I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” but said she believed in a two-state solution.
US prosecutors have unsealed an affidavit against Julian Assange that outlines their case against the WikiLeaks co-founder on a single count of “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion” that may or may not have succeeded.

As FBI special agent Megan Brown admits in the affidavit, “it remains unknown whether Manning and Assange were successful in cracking the password” to the Department of Defense computer they allegedly conspired to hack, meaning the sole charge against Assange remains his alleged attempt to assist Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning in accessing the documents that were eventually leaked in 2010.

The “probable cause” for Assange’s extradition to the US is described as hundreds of messages sent between Manning and Assange on the Jabber platform. The two “conspirators” should have known that releasing the documents “would cause injury to the United States,” Brown declares, since it contained information about US allies in Afghanistan who were assisting coalition forces.

The affidavit dramatically refers to “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States,” but fails to even ascertain whether the “illegal agreement that Assange and Manning reached” was what ultimately unleashed the trove of documents. Brown can only speculate as to how the computer was eventually breached.

Also on rt.com Unsealed Assange indictment proves Chelsea Manning's imprisonment is 'purely punitive' – legal team

In an effort to present the leaks in as damaging a light as possible, Brown reproduces one almost cartoonish exchange, claiming “after the release of the Afghanistan War Reports, a member of the Taliban contacted the New York Times” and stated: “We are studying the report… If they are US spies, then we will know how to punish them.” Osama bin Laden is also said to be a WikiLeaks fan, with letters found during the raid on his Abbottabad compound instructing an al-Qaeda member to “gather” the material leaked by Manning.

Having been assigned to the case in 2017 - less than a year before filing the affidavit – Brown admits her understanding of the seven-year-old “criminal conspiracy” is based on “testimony of a forensic examiner in Manning’s court martial, my conversations with FBI forensic examiners, and research on the internet.” The internet was quick to pick apart her timing – and the rest of the document.

The alleged crime was in 2010, but Brown wasn't assigned to the case until 2017.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Monday that she would immediately move to place a "total moratorium" on new federal fossil fuel leases if elected president, blocking energy companies from drilling offshore and producing oil, gas and coal from U.S. government-owned land.

The Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 contender said she would prioritize building new renewable energy projects. Warren said her administration would set a goal of producing 10 percent of the nation's electric power from wind towers, solar farms, and other clean energy projects constructed offshore or on public lands.

Warren revealed the proposal in a blog post on Medium that laid out her plans for managing the public parks and vast swaths of land that the federal government manages. She said it would form part of her strategy for addressing climate change.

"It is wrong to prioritize corporate profits over the health and safety of our local communities," she wrote.

"And it's not enough to end our public lands' contribution to climate change. We have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution, and for both economic and environmental reasons, we should take it."

Warren said she would also reinstate an Obama-era rule to prevent methane — a potent greenhouse gas — from escaping into the atmosphere from oil and gas operations on federal land.

The policy would mark a dramatic reversal from President Donald Trump's position. Trump has sought to increase drilling on public lands and open virtually all federal offshore areas to oil and gas exploration.

The Trump administration has overseen the rollback of dozens of environmental and energy regulations, including the methane rule.

Warren's plan goes further than measures taken by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama placed a moratorium on federal coal leasing — though not on oil and gas production — and sought to indefinitely block offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean and parts of the Atlantic.

Permitting for onshore oil and gas drilling was up nearly 40% in 2018, due in large part to expanded use of automated systems set in motion under Obama, according to a Reuters analysis.

In 2018, the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management generated $1.1 billion in onshore oil and gas lease sales, nearly three times the previous annual record set in 2008. The previous year, the leases drummed up nearly $360 million, the second-highest total on record at the time.

Nearly half of the revenue goes to the states where land is leased. New Mexico accounted for the biggest lease sales in both 2017 and 2018.

Warren's vow to ban fossil fuel leasing comes as climate change becomes an increasingly prominent component of the Democratic platform. Freshmen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's expansive Green New Deal has focused attention on the issue and sparked several proposals for federal climate strategies, including from Republicans.
Kornblumen statt Geranien, Grün statt Kies, seltener Rasen mähen – und pestizidfrei sowieso. Jeder Garten- oder Balkonbesitzer kann seinen kleinen Anteil zum Schutz unserer Insekten leisten. Die Natur dankt es mit Vielfalt und spannenden Beobachtungen selbst am Blumenkübel. Wir haben zehn Vorschläge, die meist einfach umzusetzen sind.

1. Rund 550 Wildbienenspezies wurden in Deutschland nachgewiesen – und fast zwei Drittel davon gelten als bedroht oder ausgestorben. Viele dieser Arten sind Spezialisten, die sich nicht unbedingt in den Garten verirren, weil sie beispielsweise auf bestimmte Pflanzen wie Orchideen angewiesen sind. Aber für den immer noch großen Rest können wir etwas tun. Eine Ackerhummel zum Beispiel besucht in der gleichen Zeit die drei- bis fünffache Zahl an Blüten wie eine Honigbiene. Rund 150 Nutzpflanzensorten und etwa 80 Prozent aller Wildpflanzen hier zu Lande sind auf wilde Bestäuber wie Wildbienen, Schwebfliegen, Schmetterlinge oder andere Insekten angewiesen. Und diese können Sie am besten mit einheimischen Blütenpflanzen fördern. Doch auch manche Zierpflanze leistet gute Dienste: In vielen Gartenbaumärkten können Sie mittlerweile Blumenwiesenmischungen kaufen, die sich statt des eigenen Rasens oder auch im Balkonkasten eignen. Wer sich an der Umgebung orientieren will, kann selbst Samen auf Brachflächen und an Wegrändern sammeln. Diese Pflanzen sind dann mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit an die lokalen Bedingungen angepasst. Wer dennoch nicht auf Zierpflanzen verzichten möchte, sollte im Gartencenter die Augen aufhalten, welche Arten dort besonders eifrig von Bienen und Hummeln angeflogen werden. Eine Liste guter Pflanzen bietet der BUND zum Download an.

2. Das Gleiche wie bei den Blumen gilt auch für Sträucher: Viele in Baumärkten und Gartencentern angebotene Büsche sind für unsere Insekten wertlos, weil es sich um Exoten handelt. Türkische Kirschlorbeeren oder chinesische Glanzmispeln werden kaum von einheimischen Insekten aufgesucht, sieht man vielleicht von Blattläusen ab. Dagegen nutzen Dutzende Insekten- und rund 60 Vogelarten den Holunder als Nahrungspflanze: Sie fressen Blätter oder Beeren und nutzen die Blüten als Nektarspender. Optimal für Tiere ist eine Mischhecke aus verschiedenen Pflanzenarten, in denen neben Holunder zum Beispiel Haselnuss, Weißdorn, Schlehen, wilde Rosen oder Felsenbirnen wachsen. Davon profitiert nicht nur die Fauna – Sie ziehen ebenfalls Nutzen daraus, wenn Sie Früchte ernten wollen. Selbst wenn Sie eine Schnitthecke wollen, die regelmäßig getrimmt wird, bietet die heimische Natur Alternativen: Hainbuchen, Liguster oder Weißdorn bieten Vögeln und Insekten (oder Igeln) Unterschlupf oder zumindest die Blätter zum Fressen. Heimische Wildsträucher bieten zudem den Vorteil, dass sie an unsere Klimaverhältnisse angepasst und daher deutlich robuster und pflegeleichter sind als Exoten. Eine Liste geeigneter Sträucher bietet der NABU auf seiner Seite an.

3. Ein kurz geschnittener, sattgrüner englischer Rasen ist für viele Gartenbesitzer das höchste der Gefühle: Jedes Gänseblümchen, jeder Löwenzahn gilt als persönliche Beleidigung und wird rigoros bekämpft. Für einheimische Wildtiere ist das gestutzte Gras jedoch praktisch wertlos, sieht man vielleicht von Wurm suchenden Amseln ab. Dabei könnten schon kleine Maßnahmen die Vielfalt und Anzahl beispielsweise von Wildbienen dramatisch erhöhen. Das zeigt eine Studie aus den USA. Die Wissenschaftler wollten wissen, wie sich unterschiedliche Rasenmähintervalle auf Bestäuber in Gärten auswirken. Sie ließen dazu 16 Rasenflächen in Springfield entweder wöchentlich, alle zwei oder alle drei Wochen trimmen und zählten die Arten und Individuen von Wildbienen, welche diese Testareale aufsuchten. Dabei wurde sichergestellt, dass keiner der Gärten zur Vernichtung so genannter Unkräuter mit Pestiziden eingenebelt wurde. Wie zu erwarten, schnitt der englische Rasen mit Abstand am schlechtesten ab. Bei einem Intervall von drei Wochen wiederum war die Anzahl der Blumen – vor allem von Löwenzahn und Klee – am höchsten, was auch die größte Bienenvielfalt anlockte. Die größte Individuenzahl wiederum stellte sich ein, wenn alle zwei Wochen gemäht wurde. Wer also nicht unbedingt daheim Wimbledon-Tennis spielen möchte, könnte vielleicht doch ab und an den Rasenmäher in der Garage lassen. Die mittlerweile häufig eingesetzten Mähroboter stellen zudem eine Gefahr für Amphibien, Reptilien und sogar Igel dar, wie Naturschutzverbände mahnen. Die Tiere werden nicht als Hindernisse erkannt und erleiden schwere Schnittverletzungen durch das Mähwerk.
Trailhead Direct, the popular transit-to-trails service that connects city dwellers to nearby hiking destinations, will return this week with even more pickup locations and trailheads.

Starting April 20, King County Metro riders can board shuttles from Sound Transit’s Tukwila International Boulevard, University Street, Mount Baker and Capitol Hill light-rail stations — as well as other transit hubs along the routes — to reach the region’s mountain forests on weekends and Metro holidays.

The Sky Country Trailhead in Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park has been added as a new destination this year. Hikers can reach the mountain via the shuttle that picks up riders at Sound Transit’s Tukwila International Boulevard Station.

Traffic Lab is a Seattle Times project that digs into the region’s thorny transportation issues, spotlights promising approaches to easing gridlock, and helps readers find the best ways to get around. It is funded with the help of community sponsors Alaska Airlines, CenturyLink, Kemper Development Co., NHL Seattle, PEMCO Mutual Insurance Company and Seattle Children’s hospital. Seattle Times editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over Traffic Lab content.

That route will also stop at the Renton Transit Center and Renton Park-and-Ride. Passengers can stay on the shuttle and continue to the Issaquah Transit Center, where they can transfer to Trailhead Direct routes that serve the Issaquah Alps and Mailbox Peak.

Hikers who board shuttles at the Capitol Hill and University Street light-rail stations, the Eastgate Freeway Station in Bellevue or the North Bend Park-and-Ride can reach Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe and Little Si.

Boarding at the Mount Baker Transit Center or the Eastgate Freeway Station, hikers can reach Margaret’s Way, Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point, the High School Trail and East Sunset Way. That route also stops at the Issaquah Transit Center.

For detailed information about pickup and drop-off times for each site, visit King County’s website.

The service costs about $913,000 to provide this year, with money coming from Metro, the Seattle Department of Transportation and outdoor retailer REI, Metro said.

In its first year, about 900 people used the service. That was about 40 per day on weekends and on Labor Day between August and October.

Last summer, passengers took more than 10,000 trips, King County reported.

In a survey of more than 1,000 respondents, people said they took Trailhead Direct mostly because the service was “more environmentally friendly than driving.” People also said they relied on the shuttle because they don’t own a car and didn’t want to have to worry about finding parking.

Trailhead Direct riders who board from downtown Seattle and Tukwila will arrive at trailheads in less than an hour, the county said.

Shuttles can carry between 13 and 27 passengers, depending on the size of the bus, plus two bicycles for each trip. Rides cost Metro’s standard $2.75 fare.

Passengers can pay with an ORCA card, the Transit GO ticket, or cash with exact change.

Dogs may ride the shuttles, with a Metro operator’s permission. Larger, non-service dogs may require an additional fare.

Brian Brusseau (left), member of the Roofers Union Local 33, and Senator Edward Markey spoke in support of the United Council of Food Workers who have been picketing outside of Stop & Shop in Quincy for the past four days. Union powerhouses that used to reign over swaths of the New England grocery industry have either consolidated or have fallen into disarray.

Last Thursday, when 31,000 Stop & Shop employees walked off the job in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, it was one of the largest supermarket strikes in 15 years.

It might also be a last stand for unionized grocery workers, whose stores are under attack by a host of competitors, all looking to grab a piece of the supermarket bounty.

“Stop & Shop is the last, best, and final hope for the great Roman empires of unionized food retail chains,” said Burt Flickinger, a grocery industry analyst with the Strategic Resource Group.

Stop & Shop, one of the last remaining union shops in the industry, is the largest grocery store chain in New England. But the dynamics affecting its fortunes reach around the world; over the last two decades, the company has been buffeted by the forces of consolidation and globalization and by the rise of the Internet.

In the late ’90s, as Walmart used its vast supply chain network to push down prices and extended its reach in the United States, Stop & Shop and other legacy unionized grocery stores sought to fend off the big box chain through acquisition and consolidation.

Walmart’s efficiencies created a “a new model for retail,” said Sterling Hawkins, the cofounder of the Center for Advancing Retail & Technology. “A lot of the smaller retailers got bought up and got pushed out of business.”



One by one, union powerhouses that used to reign over swaths of the New England grocery industry, including A&P, Pathmark, and Grand Union, fell into disarray. Stop & Shop, which was acquired by Netherlands-based Royal Ahold in 1996, stepped in to scoop up some of the languishing players. But in the process, it acquired their pensions and other benefit plans, some of which are now at issue in the ongoing labor dispute.

Ahold Delhaize, now the fourth-largest supermarket owner in the United States, also owns the Hannaford and Food Lion chains and the Peapod delivery service.

Today, there’s even more competition. Hawkins said traditional grocery stores have seen the coming tide of e-commerce for the last decade but have only moved to respond in the nearly two years since Amazon acquired Whole Foods.

“What Stop & Shop and others are bumping into,” he said, “is [that] what it means to be a supermarket retailer is shifting in terms of consumer expectations.” Customers now have an different, and higher, set of standards on factors such as delivery, costs, pick-ups, and online purchases.

“The pressures that legacy physical stores have is now through the roof, and they’re responding by trying to cut some of their overhead” and allocate those savings toward new tools to compete in the market, he said. “Hence the strike.”

Flickinger also said that the cost of benefits can be difficult to convey to union workers.

“It really becomes a challenge to communicate to the team members at the stores that while the compensation could be going up 5 to 8 percent,” other factors, like filling the hole in an unfunded pension plan, providing a robust health insurance package, and accommodating new minimum wage laws, hurt profit margins, he said. Especially when primarily nonunion players like Aldi and Costco can run their payrolls at a fraction of the cost.

Meanwhile, nontraditional players are fighting to grab a piece of the grocery industry pie.

When bulk-buying club stores, including Costco and BJ’s, first opened in New England, Flickinger said, about 30 percent of their stock were supermarket items, as opposed to paper goods, electronics, and the like. Today that number is more than 70 percent. The same can be said for Walmart and Target, which started with about 35 percent of their sales in grocery-related items. Now those numbers are closer to 75 percent of their sales.

Drug stores such as CVS are also stealing market share, driving consumers in with big discounts on items in traditional supermarket “power aisles” including cereal, tea, canned foods, and coffee, he said. And family-owned grocery stores — Big Y, Roche Bros., Market Basket, and Wegman’s — all have loyal followings and stand ready to scoop up shoppers turned away from Stop & Shop.

With Amazon slicing prices at Whole Foods and well-funded delivery options such as Instacart using their technological prowess to serve shoppers whenever they want, it really has become a perfect storm for the unionized grocery stores like Stop & Shop to withstand.

One consideration to watch is how well customers will deal with the ongoing strike and whether they’ll stick with the brand.

New Englanders are uniquely loyal to their grocery stores, analysts said, as proven by the scenario that played out in the aftermath of the Market Basket shutdown in 2014.

The stores bounced back phenomenally in the wake of the temporary closures, said Scott Sanders, who runs Boston consultancy Growcery Partners. And the timing might benefit Stop & Shop and its workers; given the increasing attention to workers’ rights on the political left, especially among millennials, some shoppers may make a point of returning to Stop & Shop after the current crisis ends.

According to statistics released in February by the Department of Labor, 2018 saw the highest number of employees going on strike since 1986.

Sanders, who consulted with Stop & Shop at a previous job, said the store’s managers had been trained to operate cash registers and stock shelves in the event of a strike. The question, he said, was how well they’d be able to manage those jobs along with their own.

“They’ll keep running the stores, but I don’t know if they’ll be run well,” Sanders said. “During the strike, if the stores become ghost towns and it’s hard to even buy anything, people might change their habits enough to shop somewhere else. If it’s an extended enough time for shoppers to change a habit, it could be troublesome.”

Oh, dear Phoenix. The Suns are a franchise plagued by losing seasons, painful memories, and Bob Sarver. The bright spots of their team include Devin Booker, DeAndre Ayton, and other young players that could pan out into serviceable starters. That being said, the Suns are a long, long way from contention in the west. A huge offseason looms for Phoenix, as they try to make their way towards a brighter future in the desert.

The NBA Draft

The Suns are projected to receive the second overall pick in this year’s draft but have an equal chance of first or third. Depending on where this pick falls, the Suns will have different plans. Their two biggest needs are at the PG and PF. Booker runs the SG, Ayton plays center, and one of Josh Jackson or Mikal Bridges should develop into a plug-and-play 3-and-D wing. The obvious pick for this team is Zion Williamson. He fills a need perfectly at PF and is the most highly-touted player in the draft. If they get the first pick, it’ll be used on Zion.

If the pick falls to second, they should pivot to drafting PG Ja Morant, the second most talented player in the draft. He also fills a need at the PG position. Anything lower and the Suns should target Coby White, the second best PG in the draft. This would allow them to at least fill a need with a very talented prospect, albeit not one of the top two. Assuming Phoenix drafts either a PG or a PF in the first round, their free agency needs are clear.

The position that Phoenix doesn’t draft should be the one they pursue in free agency. I’m going to keep it realistic and assume that players such as Kyrie Irving (and Eric Bledsoe) don’t answer Phoenix’s calls. If the Suns need a PG, they should target three players. I’d call one a reach, one a possibility, and one a safety.

First off, Phoenix should attempt to woo Kemba Walker. A backcourt of him and Devin Booker would be a sight to see. The more realistic option is Terry Rozier. While Boston does have the right to match any offer made by Phoenix, it’s unlikely they’d pay him too much money to back up Kyrie. He’d complement Devin Booker well and provide a young PG to develop amongst the rest of the team.

If the Suns draft a guard, though, they’ll need a PF. The best-case scenario for Phoenix is to nab Julius Randle. He and Ayton could develop together and form a two-headed monster in the frontcourt. That would certainly catapult the Suns out from the Western Conference cellar. Some lower-ceiling options include Thaddeus Young (unlikely to leave Indiana) or Marcus Morris. Finally, if the Suns strike out on everyone, they could simply allow Dragan Bender to develop with some minutes at the four, though this would lead to more losses than the other options.

The best-case scenario for the Suns is to round out their starting five with two young players that can develop alongside the rest of the team. If they can accomplish that, good things will follow in Phoenix.

OTTAWA — Canada has formally joined a German-French coalition aimed at saving the international world order from destruction by various world dictators and autocrats — and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The initiative is part of ongoing government efforts to shore up international co-operation at a time of waning American leadership and Trump’s outspoken disdain of institutions created after the Second World War, including the G7, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland offered Canada’s support for the Alliance for Multilateralism during a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Dinard, France earlier this month.

Japan also joined the new alliance during the meeting, and Freeland marked the moment on Twitter posting a photo of herself with Jean-Yves Le Drian, Heiko Mass and Taro Kono, her French, German and Japanese counterparts.

“Many of today’s greatest challenges are global and they can only be solved when we work together. That is why Canada stands united with its German, French, and Japanese friends,” Freeland said in the photo’s caption.

Freeland also avoided any direct mention of the Trump administration, as has been her approach generally in her frequent critiques of the attacks on the world’s multilateral order and the need to defend against them.

Le Drian and Maas appeared to dance around the fact that the United States was not a member when they formally unveiled the new alliance in early April at the United Nations.

France’s envoy to Canada, however, connected the initiative to Trump in a recent interview.

“Mr. Trump doesn’t like to value multilateralism,” said Ambassador Kareen Rispal, referring to his withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement, and his criticism of the UN and WTO.

“It sends the wrong message to the world if we think that because Mr. Trump is not in favour of multilateralism, it doesn’t mean we — I mean countries like Canada, France, Germany and many others — are not still strong believers.”

During testimony last week before the Senate foreign affairs committee, Freeland said that Canada joined the alliance overs concerns in the G7 over the growing threats posed by authoritarian regimes and their disinformation campaigns aimed and discrediting democracy and its institutions.

She commended “G7 partners” Germany, France and Japan, but again made no mention of the U.S.

“We agree that the greatest challenges of our time like climate change, income inequality, managing the power of global technology platforms, maintaining rules-based global trade and mass migration, are truly international challenges,” Freeland said.

“We know in order to walk the walk in supporting the rules-based international order we need to show people how essential these institutions are in our daily lives.”

Freeland cited Canada’s participation in several other multilateral initiatives, including the Lima Group coalition on Venezuela, and ongoing support for international trade bodies and treaties.

On Monday, Canada imposed sanctions on another 43 people it says are implicated in the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.

The sanctions, now totalling 113, target high ranking officials in the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including regional governors and those undermining democratic institutions, said Global Affairs Canada.

The new sanctions coincided with Freeland joining her counterparts in Santiago, Chile at their 12th Lima Group meeting. The Western Hemisphere Coalition does not include the U.S., but is nonetheless aligned with the Trump administration in calling for Maduro’s ouster.

Canada, its Lima Group allies, and the U.S. are among approximately 50 countries that say Maduro stole his country’s election last year and is no longer the legitimate leader of Venezuela.

They instead recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s interim president, and have called on the Venezuelan military to back him.

Canada has excluded the U.S. from another multilateral initiative, aimed at reforming the WTO. In October, Canada hosted 13 of the WTO’s more than 160 members in Ottawa for a meeting that is looking at ways to reform the world’s trade referee.

On Monday, Freeland’s office responded to the WTO’s most recent decision in its ongoing softwood lumber dispute with the U.S. Last week, the WTO issued what was essentially a split decision that upheld a controversial U.S. practice known as “zeroing” to calculate anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood.

“We welcome the recent WTO panel ruling that the United States did not follow the rules in calculating its anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. The United States must bring its measures into conformity with its WTO obligations,” Freeland said in a separate statement.

“Canada will be appealing the WTO panel’s separate findings on the U.S. practice of zeroing and its use of the differential pricing methodology. The WTO has ruled more than 20 times that zeroing, a method of calculating and applying artificially high and unfair duty rates, is inconsistent with WTO rules.”


Nationals pitchers celebrate a win in the cabbage races at the start of spring training. The Nationals have carried it over into the regular season as a symbol of big wins. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)

It was as if someone had lost control of a confetti cannon of cabbage.

On Saturday, after a come-from-behind, 3-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Washington Nationals gathered in the clubhouse, formed two teams and passed around a head of cabbage in a relay race until the last person in each line hurled it to the floor. Afterward, shreds of translucent green coated the clubhouse carpet. It looked like iceberg lettuce, but players asserted later it was indeed cabbage, the leafy, “firm-headed,” Brussels sprouts-parenting, bloated basketball-looking vegetable that, on average, weighs about six times more than a baseball — and has come to define the Nationals’ dramatic wins this season.

“The boys like their cabbage,” Manager Dave Martinez said.

On April 9 in Philadelphia, Martinez’s team erased a 6-1 deficit and won in extra innings. When the players returned to the visitors’ clubhouse, they shuttled around the sauerkraut staple for the first time during the regular season and smashed it on the floor. Within hours, two companies had already started selling Nationals “Cabbage Smash Kids” T-shirts.

In that moment, the Nationals were resurrecting an activity from spring training. It started Feb. 17, when third base coach Bob Henley assumed the responsibility of firing up the players. He searched the Internet for inspiration, read it was “National Cabbage Day” and “National Random Acts of Kindness Day,” and apparently opted to become the Vegetable Vagabond.

[After Max Scherzer finds his footing, Wander Suero slips in Nationals’ 4-3 loss to Pirates]

That day, Henley acquired heads of cabbage and gathered some team members, mostly pitchers. He preached the hidden virtues of cabbage and surprised a few players, including veteran starter Jeremy Hellickson, who “had never looked at cabbage that way before.”

“Cabbage is very versatile, and it sticks together,” Hellickson said, even though the players ended this exercise by spiking the symbol of solidarity into smithereens.

That first day in camp, the pitchers were the only ones who relay-raced, so closer Sean Doolittle’s favorite part about last week’s comeback against the Phillies was getting the hitters involved.

“It’s a good, healthy way to get our vegetables in after a game,” Doolittle deadpanned. He added: “It’s a fun thing. We had fun in camp. And the message is about being able to pick your teammates up. We’re all in this as a group. It was just a fun way to end the night.”

Since spring training, the Nationals have tried to keep the specifics of their cabbage conventions confidential. The team believes, as Martinez and Henley do, that maintaining “the circle of trust” in the clubhouse will build chemistry and help performance. When reporters questioned center fielder Victor Robles about the debris after the Philadelphia win, the rookie revealed little.

“It's something we do together as a team, so obviously I was involved,” he said, smiling.

The journeyman Hellickson has seen these positive reinforcement techniques before. The most common from his 10-year, five-team career is a fog machine that the team turns on for the players to walk through after victories. Early in his career, with Tampa Bay, the player of the game got to flick on the light to a Captain Morgan sign after victories. Hellickson said he finds this one, turning triumphs into scenes from a dark, twisted episode of “VeggieTales,” “the most random.”

Still, though, after his stints with Arizona, Philadelphia and Baltimore, Hellickson respects the difficulty of rallying to a victory. He understands it’s a long season, that the team will need something good-natured to break up the monotony. He knows there won’t always be a head of cabbage to smash and to appreciate the chance when there is one.

“It’s hard to win ballgames,” Hellickson said, “so it helps to celebrate ‘em.”

In preparation for his Beyond mission, ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano was at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, USA, in March 2019. Here he is strapped to the Partial Gravity Simulator to practice repairing the dark-matter hunter AMS-02.

AMS-02, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, consists of seven instruments that monitor cosmic rays from space. The 6918 kg instrument was installed in 2011 and results hint at a new phenomenon that may reveal more about the invisible ‘dark matter’.

The facility was only meant to run for only three years, but it has been so successful that the International Space Station partners and scientific community wish to extend its working life. Despite this, three of the four cooling pumps have stopped working and need to be repaired – this is where Luca comes in.

At the Space Vehicle Mock-up Facility in ‘Building 9’ Luca is testing tools, procedures and techniques to replace the cooling system during a series of spacewalks planned for this year. AMS-02 was never designed to be repaired in space so each aspect of the spacewalk needs to be considered and practiced in detail.
BHATPARA: Amid claims of "misusing" the armed forces for electoral gain, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the strength of "one vote" had enabled the surgical strike and air strike in Pakistan.Addressing a poll rally here in Chhattisgarh , Modi said the India of today carries out surgical and air strikes across the border and shoots down satellite in space due to the strength of "one vote" of the people.The Election Commission last week sought a report from poll officials in Maharashtra after Modi's remarks at a rally in Latur, where he asked first-time voters to dedicate their vote to those who carried out the Balakot air strike.The report was sought in the context of an EC advisory issued last month asking parties to desist from indulging in political propaganda involving actions of the armed forces.Modi also stepped up attack on Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, saying it was the mindset of the "sultanate" of the 'Naamdar' to abuse the deprived and treat them as slaves.Modi's barb came a day after Gandhi made the "how come all Modis are thieves" remark.Modi attributed Gandhi's comment to frustration among the Congress and its "Mahamilvati" allies caused by the "BJP wave" being witnessed across the country."These people are crossing limits daily. According to them, anyone whose name is Modi is a thief. What kind of politics is this? They have labelled a whole community as thieves only to get some applause, just to insult your 'chowkidar'," Modi said."I have a question. Why all the thieves have Modi in their names whether be it Nirav Modi Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi? We don't know how many more such Modis will come out," Gandhi had said, addressing a rally in Maharashtra Monday."The Congress and its Mahamilavati allies are unable to sleep during night. Now they are abusing me in frustration, are insulting me. The voters of India are seeing this," Modi said."It is naamdar's sultanate mindset which sneers at the exploited, deprived and treats them as slaves," he said.The Congress labelled honest tax-payers as selfish, Modi said. The naamdars are faced with cases of income tax theft of crores of rupees, he added."They are having fun after committing scam following land allotment to bring out a newspaper...they are out on bail," Modi said, without naming the National Herald case."They seek commission in deals relating to national security," Modi said, in a veiled reference to the Bofors scam, in which late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's name was dragged by the opposition.

eToroX, the blockchain division of global investment company eToro, has today announced the launch of its crypto exchange – a secure and regulated trading venue offering a range of cryptoassets as well as a suite of stablecoins.

Commenting on the news, Yoni Assia, Co-founder and CEO of eToro, said: “Just as eToro has opened up traditional markets for investors, we want to do the same in the tokenized world. We want to bring crypto and tokenized assets to a wider audience, allowing them to trade with confidence. This is the future of finance. Blockchain will eventually ‘eat’ traditional financial services through tokenization.”

At launch the exchange will have a range of instruments including:

• 8 fiat-stablecoins (eToro New Zealand Dollar (NZDX), eToro Japanese Yen (JPYX), eToro Swiss Franc (CHFX), eToro United States Dollar (USDEX), eToro Euro (EURX), eToro Pound Sterling (GBPX, eToro Australian Dollar (AUDX), eToro Canadian Dollar (CADX)

• 6 cryptos (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Dash (DASH), BitcoinCash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC)

• 37 pairs including BTC-USD, XRP-GBP etc.

The launch of the exchange is a natural next step in eToro’s blockchain journey which began with the work with Colored Coins in 2012. eToro was one of the first regulated financial companies to offer crypto, enabling users to trade bitcoin in 2014 and today has 15 cryptoassets on the eToro platform.

The exchange is managed by eToroX, a subsidiary of eToro Group. eToroX is one of the first companies to be certified as a regulated Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC).

Doron Rosenblum, Managing Director of eToroX, said: “We are proud to be one of the first companies in the world to obtain a license for cryptoassets, and one of only a handful of regulated exchanges in the crypto space.

“In the coming weeks and months we will add more cryptoassets, stablecoins and tokens to the exchange and will work with other exchanges to encourage them to list our growing range of stablecoins.”

Tokenization helps open up markets and encourages diversification by facilitating fractional ownership and removing geographical boundaries.

Yoni Assia concluded: “We believe that we will see the greatest transfer of wealth ever as financial services move onto the blockchain. The blockchain brings transparency and a new paradigm for asset ownership. In time, we will see the tokenization of all traditional asset classes, as well as the emergence of new asset classes such as tokenized art, property or even IP. Cryptoassets are just the first step on this journey and we are excited to explore the opportunities offered by tokenization with the launch of our exchange.”

Probably the most hated feature of Electribe ER-1 is those four boring samples. Everybody has complained about them and the permanent nature of those. Actually, the samples are stored in Flash memory so there’s nothing sacred about them and it was simply a choice of the designers to make them look permanent. Electribe Shaman Firmware update 3.0.5 exposes new MIDI System Exclusive Message (ALL SAMPLE DATA DUMP) that makes loading custom samples in place of the factory ones possible.

Caveats? All four samples have to be loaded together. The total size of samples must not exceed 250 KBytes. And Shamen Firmware update has to be installed for this to work.

The samples have to be in a specific format – 16-bit .WAV. 32 KHz. Mono. Linear PCM, no compression. Aside from that they can contain anything. Electribe ER-1 assumes that the samples are in predefined order: Close Hi-Hat, Open Hi-Hat, then Crash, then Hand Clap. Of course it is up to anyone’s imagination what he/she wants to hear in place of Hand Clap. The samples have to be crafted into a special Sysex message in predefined format and compressed with Electribe dump data 8×7 compression. The ER-1 Flashing utility downloadable from this site does it for you if used with /samples option. The exact format of this message is described at the bottom of this page for those who simply insist on knowing every detail.

Can the original samples be restored after reflashing with custom ones? Absolutely. The process is exactly the same, You provide the four original samples (for your convenience the original, authentic samples are made downloadable on this page), let the conversion utility assemble them into the Sysex format and send it over MIDI. The message takes approximately 80 seconds to transmit. The samples on both of my ER-1 and ER-1mkII are exactly the same. Besides, according to data sheet, the minimum guaranteed erase/program cycle count for this particular Flash memory device is 100,000 so you have plenty of time to experiment.



 Electribe ER-1 Close Hi-Hat Sample

 Electribe ER-1 Open Hi-Hat Sample

 Electribe ER-1 Crash Sample

 Electribe ER-1 Hand Clap Sample



Here is the complete SysEx message restoring the original samples that can be transmitted with any SysEx capable MIDI utility. I prefer C6 Sysex Tool by Elektron. Configure the Delay to 900 ms and you are good to go.

Over the past week I've learned two important things from our moral, ethical, and intellectual betters on the left: 1) Free speech that criticizes a Democrat is tantamount to violence, and 2) Actual violence committed by a Democrat is a form of free speech.

For the first part of this oxymoronic equation, let's go to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Last week she made the news again for summarizing the 9/11 attacks as "Some people did something." And now she'd like you to stop criticizing her for it:

We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop. pic.twitter.com/gwB2kDUIRp — Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) April 15, 2019

In other words, criticizing Ilhan Omar is an incitement to violence. This is now the Democratic Party line. Remember this assertion, because we'll pick it up in a moment.

Now for part two. I don't watch The Good Fight on CBS All-Access, because if there's anything more baffling to me in 2019 than watching CBS, it's paying to watch CBS. So I missed a real treat last week.

Karen Townsend, Newsbusters:

In the April 11 episode of the CBS All-Access show The Good Fight, titled “The One where a Nazi Gets Punched,” Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) and Jay Di Persia (Nyambi Nyambi), two black law clerks travel to a rural community outside Chicago to be Democrat poll watchers on voting day for a special election...

The end of the episode has Jay addressing the camera with a riot around him... Jay goes full ANTIFA...

"Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked? I was always taught to never throw the first punch. Never instigate. Defend, don't attack. But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview, and I realized... Spencer was in a pressed suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered, like he should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view. And then I realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal. Some speech requires a more visceral response. It's like Overton's window. That's the term from which (sic) ideas are tolerated in public discourse. Well, Overton's window doesn't mean $#!+ unless it comes with some enforcement. So, yeah: This is enforcement. It's time to punch a few Nazis."

I assume that if I have a problem with the Columbia Broadcasting System putting out an open call for political violence, that means I like Nazis, or I'm a Nazi, or something to do with Nazis.

Richard Spencer denies being a Nazi, but he sure does pattern himself after one. According to this line of thinking, that means it's okay to physically attack him. Indiana Jones punches Nazis in the movies, right? Captain America punches Nazis. Punching Nazis is good.

Okay, then. Who decides which guys should get punched? Which ones are Nazis? Where is the line drawn?

Is David Duke a Nazi? He's at least Nazi-adjacent. He believes a lot of the same things. Is it okay to walk up to him and punch him, to show that his speech isn't equal?

If so, what are we to do with this information?

Dr Duke & Eric Striker: By Defiance to Z.O.G. Ilhan Omar is NOW the most important Member of the US Congress! https://t.co/R4d4X81xdv pic.twitter.com/C083V57VQp — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) March 7, 2019

Wow. David Duke really likes Ilhan Omar. He's positively stanning her.

If it's okay to punch Duke, and Duke finds common cause with Omar, but we're not even supposed to criticize Omar because it's inciting violence... That's kind of confusing, right?

It's almost as if these guys are just making up this nonsense as they go along. It's almost as if they don't care that their rationalizations for silencing people they don't like are self-contradictory, as long as they get the job done.

Almost!

It's a big mistake to condone political violence, no matter how angry and self-righteous you feel. Not only is it morally and ethically wrong, but you look like an idiot when you justify assaulting anti-Semites and then turn right around and demand that everybody stop criticizing political speech from an anti-Semite.

But then, if they were willing or able to think these things through, they wouldn't be Democrats.
The Wipro board on April 16 approved a buyback for up to 32.3 crore shares at Rs 325 per share totalling up to Rs 10,500 crore.

Wipro has approved a proposal to buy back up to 32,30,76,923 equity shares being 5.35 percent of the total paid-up equity share capital, at a price of Rs 325 per share, the company said in a release to the exchange.

Also Read: Wipro reports Q4FY19 results, net income at Rs 2,480 crore

The IT major had last conducted a buyback in November 2017. Its last buyback was for shares worth Rs 11,000 crore at Rs 320 per share.

Addressing media persons, Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our rigour in execution and focus on improved quality of revenues has resulted in operating margin expansion of 1.8 percent for the year. Our operating cash flows were robust and 129.2 percent of our net income for the year. The announcement to buy back equity shares is part of our philosophy to deliver efficient returns to our shareholders."

"We have had a very good year of cash, close to $1 billion in terms of cash flow in our balance sheet and therefore, we think the time is right to go for the buyback. That is how we have given Rs 10,500 crore. The payout ratio is 123 percent and is a healthy mark by any standard in the industry," he added.

As per SEBI guidelines, a company can buy back its shares only once in 12 months. A company is not allowed to make any offer of buyback within a period of one year reckoned from the date of expiry of buyback period of the preceding buyback offer if any, as per rules.

In the last few years, IT majors like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions, HCL Technologies and Mindtree have all announced share buybacks.

The buyback is at a premium of 15.4 percent to its closing price of Rs 281.6 on the NSE on April 16.
El rascacielos Torre Espacio, una de las cuatro grandes torres del Paseo de la Castellana de Madrid, ha sido desalojada este mediodía por una amenaza de bomba durante alrededor de dos horas y que finalmente ha resultado ser falsa, según ha informado la Policía.

Efectivos de la Policía Nacional han desalojado el edificio por motivos de seguridad y han pedido a las personas que allí se encontraban que siguieran las indicaciones del personal de seguridad.

Los agentes han cortado durante unos minutos el tráfico en este tramo del Paseo de la Castellana número 259, donde se ubica el edificio y han acordonado la zona para evitar que entre el público. Hacia el lugar se ha desplazado también la Unidad Canina de la Policía tras evacuar a casi un millar de trabajadores, el servicio de Bomberos del Ayuntamiento de Madrid y sanitarios del Samur-Protección Civil en modo preventivo a disposición de la Policía Naciona. No obstante, alrededor de las 14.00 horas han comenzado a marcharse tras confirmarse que la amenaza era falsa.

La Policía, que ha procedido al realojo del edificio, investiga ahora el origen de la llamada, según ha informado a través de las redes sociales.

El aviso llegó a la Embajada de Australia en España

Las alarmas saltaron minutos después de las 12 horas, cuando el responsable de seguridad de la Embajada de Australia en España, situada en la planta 24, llamó a la Policía porque habían recibido un aviso de bomba. La legación australiana ha informado en Twitter que cierra todo el día de hoy hasta nuevo aviso, pidiendo disculpas por los inconvenientes que ello pueda causar.

The @AusEmbEsp will remain close for the rest of today, Tuesday 16 April, until further notice. Apologies for any inconvenience — Australia in Spain (@AusEmbEsp) 16 de abril de 2019

La torre de 57 plantas y 235 metros de altura fue diseñada por José Bruguera y Henry N. Cobb, del estudio Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, y está situada en la cara norte del solar donde se ubican los rascacielos de Madrid.

Entre sus inquilinos, la torre cuenta con la sede de OHL, las embajadas de Australia, Holanda, Reino Unido y Canadá, y las oficinas de British American Tobacco o de la inmobiliaria Espacio.

Según fuentes de la Policía Nacional, "se ha establecido el protocolo de actuación en estos casos" y ahora "todo vuelve a la normalidad".

People who live in N.C. adult care homes receive $66 a month for co-pays, drug costs, snacks, clothing, transportation and more. Advocates say it’s not enough to lead a fulfilling life.

By Thomas Goldsmith

When Shirley Ann Whitfield Joyner set out from her assisted living center to be “with men for money,” her sister says, Joyner only wanted to pay for the things that made her feel human.

Judy Vines Hendrickson, of Sharpsburg, told her late sister’s story to shed light on the indignities Whitfield endured while trying to meet her needs on the $66 a month the state allows residents of assisted living facilities — a combination of $46 from North Carolina’s State/County Special Assistance fund and a $20 exclusion from the person’s income.

“She was walking into stores asking people for money, being with men for money, trying to get money for various things she needed,” Hendrickson, 64, said during a recent interview noting that she was paying for some needs out of her burial insurance policy. “Their shoes wear out; there are female things they need — the things that make them feel human.”

Joyner, the third of 10 children, died in 2016 at 58 after an extended period of poor health. The year before she had spent three months at an assisted living center in Roper, the small Eastern North Carolina town she roamed asking for cash.

Some advocates for these vulnerable people living in North Carolina institutions are pushing the state legislature to boost the money provided to residents, called the personal needs allowance. Hendrickson, Joyner’s sister, reached out to North Carolina Health News after reading of efforts to increase the amounts.

At a March 26 presentation before the General Assembly’s House Committee on Aging, representatives of the Division of Aging and Adult Services said it would cost $5.9 million to increase the personal needs allowance to $70 for more than 20,000 North Carolinians who receive special assistance in adult care homes. It would cost $7.16 million to increase the personal needs allowance from $30 to $70 for about 30,000 residents of nursing homes. The trade organizations for the assisted-living and nursing home industries are supporting the proposal.

‘Horrible and impossible’

“Without someone’s paying attention to what it takes to live, we leave people vulnerable to exploitation,” said Corye Dunn, the policy director at Disability Rights NC, a nonprofit that’s part of a coalition formed to convince budget writers at the General Assembly to increase spending-money amounts.

“It sounds horrible and impossible, but people are so desperate to meet their basic needs so that they can live with some measure of dignity and some measure of autonomy, they believe it’s the best they can do to get a basic income,” she said.

Shirley Ann Whitfield Joyner grew up on a Greene County farm, where she started having behavioral health problems after a devastating barn fire killed her fiance, her sister said.

“She did graduate from high school and had a child, one daughter,” said Hendrickson, her sister, who works as a substitute teacher.

Joyner developed anxiety and depression, with her treatment hampered by the lack of psychiatric resources in her rural setting. She lived with her daughter but entered long-term care when relatives could no longer look after her.

Hendrickson was dealing with needs within her immediate family, including a son, 41, who lives in a group home. She’d like to make a difference in the fight to get adequate spending money in the hands of residents of long-term care in North Carolina.

“I would like to start some sort of group … I’m always trying to get things better for this kind of person,” Hendrickson said. “They need to listen. They need to have a meeting with us who deal with it every day.”

Too small to count?

Increasing spending money for long-term care residents would cost about $13 million, according to state estimates. The entire budget will likely land at $24 billion to $25 billion.

“It’s a small amount, but there are an awful lot of small amounts,” Gary Pearce, a veteran political consultant who worked as senior policy adviser to former Gov. Jim Hunt. He argued the budget process tends to home in on huge initiatives that cost billions of dollars.

State Rep. Josh Dobson (R-Nebo) told members of the North Carolina Coalition for Aging on March 22 that school construction, tax policy and the overall level of state spending are likely to take up much of oxygen in budget deliberations this year.

In general, matters that touch older people require knowledge of Medicare, Medicaid, nursing homes, assisted living and others that legislators may not have mastered.

“It’s just a very complicated issue and very few people understand it,” Pearce said. “Unless you are directly touched by it, you don’t understand it.

“I wonder if the people who are touched by it are mostly lower-income people who aren’t real politically active.”

Gov. Roy Cooper proposed a 2019-2021 budget without the increase for long-term care residents, with legislative proposals and a resolution still to come. Bill Lamb, executive director of Friends of Residents in Long Term Care, said the proposed PNA increase is going to be a “heavy lift” given other priorities for the General Assembly.

That could mean more residents, such as Shirley Joyner, will likely still do whatever’s necessary to pay for a few necessities of life.

“I think people shouldn’t assume because they don’t know about it that it’s not happening in the facilities where their loved ones live,” Dunn said.
